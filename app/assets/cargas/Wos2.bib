Abstract = {{Butterflies are important pollinators and indicators of environmental
   health. Habitat destruction and fragmentation caused by developmental
   activities and poor natural resource management are the main reasons for
   the drastic decline of butterfly populations throughout the world, and
   prompt the need for effective conservation management. We assessed the
   diversity, richness, seasonal distribution and conservation priorities
   of butterflies in an inner-city parkland habitat (University of Dhaka,
   Bangladesh) and investigated the biotic, and abiotic factors affecting
   butterfly diversity. A total of 93 species from 5 families were recorded
   from January to December 2014. Nymphalidae and Papilionidae were the
   most and least dominant families in terms of species number. Butterflies
   across families generally selected nectar plants randomly, although some
   showed preference towards herbs. Spatial interpolation of butterfly
   richness indicated that the most suitable area was around Curzon Hall,
   an area containing different types of vegetation. Precipitation was the
   only abiotic factor with a significant relationship with butterfly
   species richness. The establishment of green areas with complex
   structural vegetation will improve microclimatic conditions for
   butterflies, promoting healthier urban ecosystems, and the conservation
   of butterflies and other associated species in inner-city areas.}},

Abstract = {{The New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) conducted
   a study to comprehensively examine the costs and co-benefits of green
   infrastructure using a triple bottom line (TBL) approach. A literature
   review considered the co-benefits offered by stormwater controls as well
   as urban vegetation. Co-benefits monitoring included temperature
   analyses, time-lapse cameras, and pollinator surveys across a number of
   green infrastructure types and locations. The cost analysis of green
   infrastructure spanned both economic and environmental costs, derived
   from construction and maintenance details from existing stormwater
   controls along with SimaPro, an environmental life-cycle analysis
   database. The results of the analysis were compiled into an online
   calculator designed to inform planning and outreach efforts by
   presenting more than 25 cost and benefit parameters. The information
   presented by this analysis and the associated calculator provide
   valuable support to planning and public outreach efforts associated with
   the city's green infrastructure program, allowing DEP to support both
   stormwater management and broader sustainability goals.}},

Abstract = {{To obtain basic information about haploid plants in Citrus, the
   morphological characteristics and reproductive potential of a haploid
   plant obtained from the `Banpeiyu' pummelo {[}C. maxima (Burm.) Merr.]
   were examined. The leaves, flowers and fruits of the haploid were
   significantly smaller than those of the `Banpeiyu' pummelo. Although the
   haploid showed remarkably reduced pollen fertility compared with the
   `Banpeiyu' pummelo, it produced slightly fertile pollen grains. In
   crosses with diploid cultivars, when the haploid was the seed parent,
   there was no seed. But when diploid cultivars were pollinated with
   pollen of the haploid, diploid progenies were obtained. During female
   gamete formation, no embryo-sac mother cell was formed in the ovules,
   and consequently no normal embryo sac was observed at anthesis, owing to
   female sterility caused by the lack of embryo-sac mother cell (EMC)
   formation in the haploid. During male gamete formation, however,
   univalents were not distributed to opposite poles at anaphase I in some
   dividing cells; instead, they remained near the equatorial plate. The
   nine univalents then performed mitosis, and the univalents were equally
   distributed to opposite poles. And at the tetrad stage, dyads were also
   produced in the haploid at a ratio of 24.7\%. These results suggest that
   fertile pollen grains in the haploid would be dyad derivation, produced
   by abnormalities in the first meiotic division such as first division
   restitution (FDR).}},

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY \& DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2-3}},
Pages = {{217-229}},
Abstract = {{Background: Urbanisation filters species in communities depending on
   their adaptability to conditions in built-up areas, especially in
   semi-natural habitats. Roadside vegetation is widespread along
   urban-rural gradients and is therefore a good place to study
   landscape-scale factors influencing plant community composition.
   Aim: Our study aimed to assess how plant species distributions vary
   between urban and rural landscape contexts and to identify biological
   traits favoured in urban areas.
   Methods: Presence/absence data for 63 indigenous common species were
   collected in 296 road verge patches distributed along the urban-rural
   gradient in three French cities. We investigated the effects of
   landscape composition on species assemblages and related individual
   species responses to urbanisation to functional traits associated with
   dispersal and persistence capacity.
   Results: Many grassland species were negatively affected by increasing
   proportion of built-up areas in the landscape. Insect-pollination and
   high seed production appeared to be key traits favoured in grassland
   communities in urban areas, whereas dispersal modes were less related to
   plant distribution.
   Conclusions: This study has demonstrated that urban filters affect
   common species of widespread, managed road verges. Better knowledge of
   the flora of these herbaceous roadsides may contribute to the
   conservation of common biodiversity within other grassland habitats
   found in urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{The difference between lycopene and phytohornnone levels among diploid,
   triploid and tetraploid plants of two watermelon cultivars during fruit
   growth and ripening was studied. The expression pattern of five genes
   (phytoene synthase (PSY1), phytoene desaturase (PDS), zeta-carotene
   desaturase (ZDS), carotenoid isomerase (CRT/SO), and lycopene
   beta-cyclase (LCYB)) was analyzed in details. In red-fleshed cultivar
   Mimei, lycopene content increased rapidly from 25 to 35 days after
   pollination (DAP), and then decreased at 40 DAP. Triploid and tetraploid
   fruit had higher levels of lycopene than diploid. Moreover, triploid
   tended to contain more lycopene than tetraploid during fruit growth and
   ripening stages. However, little amount of lycopene (0-2 mg kg(-1) fresh
   weight (FVV)) in yellow-fleshed cultivar Huangmei was found during all
   fruit development stages. In Mimei, transcript level of PSY1 was
   generally higher than the other four genes, and LCYB gene expression was
   the lowest among all five genes being tested. PSY1, CRTISO and LCYB
   genes showed higher transcript levels in polyploid than in diploid
   fruit. By contrast, in Huangmei, transcript level of LCYB was not the
   lowest, but only lower than that of PSY1. PSY1, CRTISO and LCYB genes
   showed higher expression levels in diploid than in polyploid fruit. In
   Mimei, the negative correlation between gibberellane (GA) content and
   lycopene accumulation was determined in all three different ploidy
   fruits, while a positive correlation was observed between abscisic acid
   (ABA) content and lycopene accumulation only in diploid watermelon.
   These results indicated that different lycopene contents in different
   ploidy watermelons is regulated by the differential transcription
   expression of the lycopene metabolic genes and phytohormones.}},

Abstract = {{Air pollution inChina is becomingmore serious especially for the

   expansion of urbanization. To solve the growing environment problems,
   daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentration data formJanuary 1, 2015, to August

   PM2.5 and PM10 concentration in this paper. The proposed model involves
   two parts. Firstly, due to its deficiency to assess the possible
   correlation between different variables, the cointegration theory is
   introduced to get the input-output relationship and then obtain the
   nonlinear dynamical system with support vector machine (SVM), in which
   the parameters c and g are optimized by flower pollination algorithm
   (FPA). Six benchmark models, including FPA-SVM, CI-SVM, CI-GA- SVM,
   CI-PSO- SVM, CI-FPA-NN,and multiple linear regression model, are
   considered to verify the superiority of the proposed hybrid model. The
   empirical study results demonstrate that the proposed model CI-FPA-
   SVMis remarkably superior to all considered benchmark models for its
   high prediction accuracy, and the application of the model for
   forecasting can give effective monitoring and management of further air

Pages = {{163-199}},
Abstract = {{Syrphidae is one of the most speciose families of true flies, with more
   than 6,100 described species and worldwide distribution. They are
   important for humans acting as crucial pollinators, biological control
   agents, decomposers, and bioindicators. One third of its diversity is
   found in the Neotropical Region, but the taxonomic knowledge for this
   region is incomplete. Thus, taxonomic revisions and species checklists
   of Syrphidae in the Neotropics are the highest priority for biodiversity
   studies. Therefore, we present the first checklist of Syrphidae for
   Ecuador based on literature records, and provide as well the original
   reference for the first time species citations for the country. A total
   of 201 species were recorded for Ecuador, with more than 600 records
   from 24 provinces and 237 localities. Tungurahua, Pastaza, and Galapagos
   were the best sampled provinces. Although the reported Ecuadorian
   syrphid fauna only comprises 11.2 \% of the described Neotropical
   species, Ecuador has the third highest flower fly diversity density
   after Costa Rica and Suriname. These data indicate the high species
   diversity for this country in such small geographic area.}},

Abstract = {{Since the rise of agriculture, human populations have domesticated plant
   and animal species to fulfil their needs. With modern agriculture, a
   limited number of these species has been massively produced over large
   areas at high local densities. Like invasive species, these Massively
   Introduced Managed Species (MIMS) integrate local communities and can
   trigger cascading effects on the structure and functioning of
   ecosystems. Here, we focus on plant and insect MIMS in the context of
   plant-pollinator systems. Several crop species such as mass flowering
   crops (e.g. Brassica napus) and domesticated pollinating insects (e.g.
   Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris) have been increasingly introduced
   worldwide and their impact on natural communities is addressed by an
   increasing number of scientific studies.
   First, we review the impacts of major insect and plant MIMS on natural
   communities by identifying how they affect other species through
   competition (direct and apparent competition) or facilitation
   (attraction, spillover). Second, we show how MIMS can alter the
   structure of plant-pollinator networks. We specifically analysed the
   position of A. mellifera from 63 published plant-pollinator webs to
   illustrate that MIMS can occupy a central position in the networks,
   leading to functional consequences. Finally, we present the features of
   MIMS in sensitive environments ranging from oceanic islands to protected
   areas, as a basis to discuss the impacts of MIMS in urban context and
   agrosystems. Through the case study of MIMS in plant-pollinator
   interactions, we thus provide here a first perspective of the role of
   MIMS in the functioning of ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The present investigation was carried out for the induction of haploid
   plants in Citrus grandis through in situ parthenogenesis by pollination
   with gamma-irradiated pollen of C. limetta and C. sinensis, treated with
   50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 Gy gamma ray doses followed by in vitro ovule
   culture. Ovule culture at 50 days after pollination (DAP) was found
   optimum for the maximum recovery of in vitro-raised plantlets as
   compared to 35 and 20 DAP. At 50 DAP, irrespective of the pollen parent,
   plantlet regeneration capacity decreased at 300 and 400 Gy irradiation
   treatment (0.62\% and 0.60\%, respectively) with maximum recovery in the
   nonirradiated control (3.07\%). Chromosome counting in actively growing
   root tips of all the in vitro-raised ovule cultured plantlets revealed
   that two haploid plants with chromosome number of nine were induced in
   C. grandis from the ovule culture that was cultured at 50 DAP following
   pollination with irradiated pollen of C. sinensis at 400 Gy and C.
   limetta pollen at 300 Gy. However, irradiation doses below 300 Gy were
   incapable of inducing any haploidsin either cross combination.
   Similarly, all the plantlets regenerated from in vitro embryo culture of
   mature seeds were found to be diploid in nature, irrespective of the
   pollen parent and irradiation dose. Molecular analysis of the in
   vitro-raised haploid and diploid plants using SSR markers confirmed the
   maternal origins of the haploid plants; however, the diploid plants were
   found zygotic in nature with one allele from the seed parent and the
   other one from the pollen parent.}},

Pages = {{166-173}},
Abstract = {{Fruit set is affected by different environmental, biological, physical
   and chemical factors. Abnormal conditions in pollination, fertilization
   and fruit set period can reduce orchard yield. Sweet cherry is one of
   the most important stone fruits of Iran which was ranked third with
   200,000 tons in 2012 in the world by an FAO report. Pollen germination
   and tube growth are the major factors of fruit set in sweet cherry. In
   polluted cities, this phenomenon may be affected by heavy metals
   stresses. In this study, the effects of different concentrations of
   heavy metals - cadmium, lead, copper and mercury by 0 (control), 50,
   100, 150, 200 and 250 ppm) - were studied on pollen germination and tube
   growth of 10 sweet cherry cultivars in vitro. The results demonstrated
   that both traits were significantly affected by different levels of
   heavy metals, cultivars and interaction among them. Pollen germination
   and tube growth of all cultivars were reduced with increase in metals
   concentrations. In the concentration of 250ppm of all heavy metals,
   pollen germination and tube growth was close to 0 in most cultivars.
   Cadmium showed the highest toxicity on pollen germination and tube
   growth and among the cultivars, ``Zard-eDaneshkadeh{''} exhibited
   highest sensitivity, while ``Colt{''} demonstrated highest tolerance to
   stress from the studied metals.}},

Abstract = {{Aspects related to the floral biology of Citrus sinensis `Pera Rio'
   variety were studied in the present work aiming to obtain information
   about the pollination ecology in the local agriculture. Studies of
   flowering, anthesis, pollen / ovule ratio, stigmatic receptivity, pollen
   viability, nectar characterization and floral visitors were carried out.
   From the data studied, the following information was obtained: C.
   sinensis variety `Pera Rio' flourishes in two annual periods (dry and
   rainy), the anthesis occurs from 9: 00 AM with duration of 24 hours,
   during which period stigma receptivity, pollen viability and nectar
   secretion are highly significant, demonstrating that the species also
   possesses characteristics of allogenic plants. Apis mellifera was a
   floral visitor, with a greater number of individuals with a Relative
   Frequency (RF) of 51.1\%. Melipona scutellaris obtained second place in
   visits with RR = 23.6\%; Followed by Trigona spinipes with FR = 17.7\%.
   The two seasons (dry and rainy) presented high similarity (Morisita
   index = 0.64). C. sinensis has floral biology favorable to cross
   pollination and bees A. mellifera and M. scutellaris are potential
   pollinators of this fruit in the conditions in the region of the
   Reconcavo Baiano. The reproductive system of C. sinensis is mixed, being
   favorable to entomophilic pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Among herbal plants, most cases of allergic reactions,
   like seasonal inflammation of nasal mucosa, conjunctivitis and pollen
   asthma, are related to the allergens from grass pollen. As the
   blossoming and pollination of rye is known to start the pollen season of
   grasses, information about the airborne rye pollen count permits
   alerting the people allergic to certain allergens contained in rye
   pollen. An important cause of allergy is also the pollen from wormwood,
   blossoming in late summer, as its two main allergens produce
   cross-reactions with many other plant allergens.
   Objective. The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk of allergic
   reactions in persons with pollinosis on the basis of the pollen
   calendar, analysis of concentrations of pollen grains of grass and rye,
   and comparison of diurnal pattern of airborne pollen grain
   concentrations at two sites with different degrees of urbanisation
   (Gudowo in the country and the city of Szczecin) in 2012-2014.
   Materials and methods. The concentration of pollen was measured by the
   volume method. Length of the pollination season was determined by the
   method of 98\%, assuming that the beginning and the end of the pollen
   season are the days on which 1\% and 99\% of the annual sum of pollen
   appeared.
   Results. The first pollen grains to appear in the air are those produced
   by rye, followed by those produced by grass and wormwood. The pollen
   seasons of grasses and wormwood started about one week earlier in Gudowo
   than in Szczecin, while the pollen season of rye started at almost the
   same time in the country and in the city. Airborne pollen counts of
   grasses, rye and wormwood were much higher in the country than in the
   city. The differences most probably result from the different floristic
   composition at these two sites and reflect the local contribution of the
   taxa studied in the country.
   Conclusions. The risk of allergy caused by the pollen of the taxa
   analysed was much higher in Gudowo (in the country), than in Szczecin
   city.}},

   viability, in vitro pollen germination of Kagzi Kalan' lemon (Citrus
   limon (L.) Osbeck), and in vivo pollen tube growth in self- and cross
   pollination to understand the mechanism of seedlessness. The results
   revealed that Kagzi Kalan had tetra-colporate spherical shaped pollen of
   uniform size. The results of Acetocarmine and FDA test and in vitro
   germination indicated normal pollen viability and germinability in Kagzi
   Kalan. In vivo pollen tube growth showed > 50\% pollen germination on
   stigma in all treatments though a greater number of pollen tubes at the
   mid style, base of the style, and near the ovule was found in cross
   pollination. Contrary to this, despite optimum pollen germination
   (53.51-70.37\%) in self-pollination treatments, none of the pollen tubes
   reached the base of the style due to abnormal growth of pollen tubes,
   viz. curvatures, inhibition of pollen tube growth, and callose
   deposition. The inhibition of pollen tubes at the mid style under
   self-pollination treatments, and production of seeded fruits under cross
   pollination treatments, indicate the presence of self-incompatibility
   and the site of inhibition of pollen tubes. Thus, gametophytic
   self-incompatibility (SI) caused seedlessness in Kagzi Kalan by blocking
   fertilization in the ovary.}},

Title = {{Landscape liveability spatial assessment integrating ecosystem and urban
   services with their perceived importance by stakeholders}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{703-725}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, landscape liveability has become a leading objective in
   policy and strategic planning. In the anthropocentric view of landscape,
   ecosystems fulfil important societal needs similarly to urban systems.
   Urban systems can meet a variety of such needs through Urban Services,
   which are historically and typically provided within cities. In this
   view, Ecosystem Services (ES) and Urban Services (US) influence
   landscape liveability in a comparable manner, so that liveability
   assessments based on both ES and US can be effective for landscape
   planning and policy-making purposes. As liveability is strongly
   dependent not only on objective landscape features, but also on the
   subjective perception of stakeholders, their involvement becomes
   essential for a coherent liveability assessment. The present study aims
   to develop a Liveability Spatial Assessment Model (LISAM) capable of
   considering both the local accessibility of services and their perceived
   relevance as expressed by stakeholders. To this end, a conceptual
   framework to detangle the spatial relationships between service sources,
   sinks, and delivery points was developed. From this base, consistent and
   comparable ES and US indices were calculated using GIS spatialisation
   techniques and then aggregated hierarchically through a Spatial
   Multicriteria Decision Making Analysis approach. Results include
   relevant maps showing explicit spatial indices of liveability that
   integrate, at various hierarchical levels, the local accessibility of ES
   and US, along with their local perceived relevance. By calculating
   complex indices able to highlight both the agri-natural and urban system
   roles on landscape liveability and by taking subjective and objective
   aspects into account, the model proved to be effective for spatial
   decision-making. In future applications, indicator and weight

Abstract = {{Ficus religiosa L. is one of the most valued cultivated ornamental fig
   trees. Native to Asia, it is known as Bodhi tree. Since fig trees are
   involved in a highly species-specific pollination mutualism with agaonid
   wasps, exotic fig species usually fail to produce seeds due to the lack
   of the specific pollinating wasps. Since 2005 we have been observing
   plantlets of F. religiosa growing on buildings in Rio de Janeiro city,
   Brazil, showing that this species was hosting pollinating wasps and,
   consequently, undertaking sexual reproduction outside its native range.
   We observed that Platyscapa quadraticeps Mayr, 1885, the original
   pollinator in Asia, was occurring in figs of F. religiosa in Brazil.
   Considering that several non-pollinating fig wasp species are associated
   with F. religiosa in its native areas, novel occurrences of wasps may be
   reported in the future in Brazil. The presence of the native pollinator
   provides conditions for this exotic tree to become naturalized and/or
   invasive in Brazil, potentially causing considerable damage to buildings
   and urban trees.}},

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Ornamental trees in urban environment are a relevant cause of illness
   due to allergenic pollen airborne dispersed. The work presented here
   analyses the importance of ornamental tree distribution and investigates
   airborne pollen records using volumetric spore traps. Three localities
   in the southwest of Spain were studied: Don Benito (DB), Plasencia (PL),
   and Zafra (ZA), in the Extremadura region. Volumetric Hirst type spore
   traps recorded pollen levels continuously for three years. Ornamental
   street trees in the study area were identified, counted and mapped.
   Airborne pollen records were found to be related to the number of trees,
   the proximity of the trees to traps, the different pollination systems
   and wind direction. A total of 17635 trees, from all localities were
   counted, belonging to 67 species, 58\% anemophilous, 22\% entomophilous,
   and 20\% both pollination systems. Five species represented more than
   50\% of the total number of ornamental trees: Platanus hispanica, Olea
   europaea, litmus minor, Acer negundo and Melia azedarach. The average
   total pollen concentration in gm(-3) was 102 (DB), 93 (PL), and 99
   (ZA)... Omitting the data for Quercus pollen, a statistically
   significant correlation between the number of trees at 0.5 km around the
   spore traps and the types of pollen recorded was found. Some measures to
   decrease the amount of potential allergenic airborne pollen in urban
   environments were identified, such as reducing trees with anemophilic
   pollination systems, eliminating male trees and employing suitable
   pruning practices. In any case, the closer the source of ornamental
   pollen, the greater the allergenic risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{1. This review assesses current knowledge about the interplay between
   landscape and pollinator communities. Our primary aim is to provide an
   evidence base, identify key gaps in knowledge and highlight initiatives
   that will help develop and improve strategies for pollinator
   conservation.
   2. Human-dominated landscapes (such as arable land and urban
   environments) can have detrimental impacts on pollinator communities but
   these negative effects can be ameliorated by proximity to semi-natural
   habitat and habitat corridors. There is also evidence to suggest that
   increased landscape heterogeneity and landscape configuration can play
   an important role in the maintenance of diverse pollinator communities.
   3. Landscape characteristics have direct impacts on pollinator
   communities, but can also influence abundance and richness through
   interaction with other drivers such as changing climate or increased
   chemical inputs in land management.
   4. The majority of existing literature focuses on specific hymenopteran
   groups, but there is a lack of information on the impact of landscape
   changes on non-bee taxa. Research is also needed on the effectiveness of
   management interventions for pollinators and multiple year observations
   are required for both urban and rural initiatives.
   5. Current policies and monitoring schemes could contribute data that
   will plug gaps in knowledge, thus enabling greater understanding of
   relationships between landscapes and pollinator populations. This would
   in turn help design mitigation and adaptation strategies for pollinator
   conservation.}},

   pollinator species, typically requesting data (e.g. in the form of
   photo-records of different species tagged by place and date). While such
   projects help scientists collect data, these data are rarely fed back to
   the public in any meaningful manner. In this paper, we address this
   through a recommender system based on Matrix Factorization over a matrix
   of observed bumblebee-plant interactions derived from data submitted to
   a citizen science project BeeWatch. The system recommends
   pollinator-friendly plants for domestic gardens and takes into account
   both the fact that different bumblebee species exhibit differing
   preferences for flowers, and that plants flower at different times of
   the year. The goal is to attract a range of bumblebee species to a
   garden and to ensure that these species have sufficient food sources

Abstract = {{The study was conducted near the city of Syktyvkar (the Komi Republic).
   The objects of study were three introduced species of the genus
   Serratula: S. coronala. L., S. inermis Gilib., S. quinquefolia M. Bieb.
   ex Willd. Comparative characterization of complexes of insect
   pollinators of three species of the genus Serratula in the middle taiga
   of the Rein i Republic is shown. It is established that the complex
   includes 51 species of insects of five orders. The dominant group of
   anthophilous insects for representatives of the genus Serratula are
   bumblebees. Of the 21 species of bumblebees found on the plants, the
   most common are Bombus jonellus (Kirby) , B. pascuorum (Scopoli) and B.
   sporadicus Nylander, two species - B. sporadicus and B. schrencki
   Morowitz, included in the Red Data Book of the Komi Republic (2009). The
   largest share of bumblebees was marked on S. quinquefolia (up to 94\% of
   the total number of insect pollinators). In the nectar of all three
   species of the genus Serratula discovered 20-hydroxyecdysone. In S.
   coronata, also detected the minor component inokosterone and ecdysone.
   The nectar of the genus Serratula, assembled in the period of mass
   flowering, contains three main carbohydrate components: sucrose,
   fructose, and glucose. As for the quantitative content of all types,
   sucrose dominates. In the nectar of S. quinquefolia its content reaches
   50\%. The presence of ecdysteroids in the composition of the nectar of
   plants speaks about possible involvement of these compounds as
   regulators in the near and far ecological relationships in terrestrial
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Occupancy modelling has received increasing attention as a tool for
   differentiating between true absence and non-detection in biodiversity
   data. This is thought to be particularly useful when a species of
   interest is spread out over a large area and sampling is constrained. We
   used occupancy modelling to estimate the probability of three
   phylogenetically independent pairs of native-introduced species
   {[}Megachile campanulae (Robertson)-Megachile rotundata (Fab.),
   Megachile pugnata Say-Megachile centuncularis (L.), Osmia pumila
   Cresson-Osmia caerulescens (L.)] (Apoidea: Megachilidae) being present
   when repeated sampling did not always find them. Our study occurred
   along a gradient of urbanization and used nest boxes (bee hotels) set up
   over three consecutive years. Occupancy modelling discovered different
   patterns to those obtained by species detection and abundance-based data
   alone. For example, it predicted that the species that was ranked 4th in
   terms of detection actually had the greatest occupancy among all six
   species. The native M. pugnata had decreased occupancy with increasing
   building footprint and a similar but not significant pattern was found
   for the native O. pumila. Two introduced bees (M. rotundata and M.
   centuncularis), and one native (M. campanulae) had modelled occupancy
   values that increased with increasing urbanization. Occupancy
   probability differed among urban green space types for three of six bee
   species, with values for two native species (M. campanulae and O.
   pumila) being highest in home gardens and that for the exotic O.
   caerulescens being highest in community gardens. The combination of
   occupancy modelling with analysis of habitat variables as an
   augmentation to detection and abundance-based sampling is suggested to
   be the best way to ensure that urban habitat management results in the
   desired outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{This case study explores a learning situation in a forest garden in
   Sweden. A forest garden is an edible polyculture landscape with
   different layers of mostly perennial vegetation. The forest garden is
   designed to maximize the yield of useful plants while minimizing the
   input of energy and resources, including human labour. Forest gardens
   may offer learning situations that contextualize interconnectedness and
   relations between organisms as well as situations that are beneficial
   for evaluative development (Keller t, 2002), i.e. the development of
   values, beliefs and moral perspectives in children.
   Twenty-seven seven to eight year old primary school children were
   followed in the first six months of a three year project in which they
   participated in developing a forest garden.
   The aim of the study is to investigate how the children reason with
   respect to different organisms' dependence on and relations to each
   other, themselves included. Specifically: How do the children describe
   their own relationships with other organisms, as well as the
   relationships between other organisms in the forest garden?
   What values of nature are expressed by the children, and in relation to
   which situations in the forest garden? Data were collected in the form
   of field notes, audio and video recordings and photos from the
   children's visits to the forest garden. The photos were used for
   stimulated recall in focus group interviews. The data were analysed
   using a combination of qualitative content analysis (Patton, 2002) and
   semi-quantitative methods.
   The children in the study presented a unidirectional perspective about
   the relationship between themselves and the organisms, especially the
   insects, in the forest garden. Rather than asking what these organisms
   can do for me/us, they pose the question: What can I/we do for the
   bugs/plants/ bees?
   The humanistic values, expressed by the children as a willingness to
   help other organisms (mostly insects) are in line with the explicit aims
   of the former curriculum for Biology to ``promote care and respect for
   nature{''}. We should note that these humanistic values are no longer
   explicitly stated in the current curriculum. It is striking that the
   anthropocentric ecosystem services perspective (introduced in the
   current curriculum from grade 4), is so rare in the data. The children
   seldom mentioned the benefits for humans from insect pollination, even
   though this relationship is clearly stated by the pedagogues together
   with humanistic values.
   In observations, the children showed a great deal of curiosity for the
   natural environment (naturalistic value) as well as joy and enthusiasm
   about participating in the different activities that took place in the
   forest garden. Aesthetic values were expressed in relation to flowers,
   cones, berries, a snail's shell etc. This study shows that forest
   gardens have the potential to be places where children can connect
   emotionally and cognitively to other organisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Abstract = {{Due to fewer bumblebees in rural areas these days, it is necessary to
   look for alternative habitats for the active protection of these very
   important pollinators. The research was carried out in The Botanical
   Garden of Medicinal Plants, in Wroclaw, Poland. In the garden,
   approximately 2000 plant species were cultivated, of which 185 were
   visited by bumblebees. Amongst them, 57 plant species were deemed very
   attractive and were determined to be indicators for 7 bumblebee species.
   Indicator species for bumblebees ranged between 6 for Bombus pratorum to
   up to 20 for B. pascuorum. Monarda didyma was an indicator plant to 6
   recorded bumblebee species. Other indicator plant species for at least 4
   bumblebees species were: Origanum vulgate, Lavandula angustifolia,
   Rhododendron catawbiense, Phacelia tanacetifolia, and Agastache rugosa.
   Three bumblebee species were found to forage the most on 11 of the
   flowering plant species. The biggest group of plants were those which
   were mostly visited by 1-2 bumblebee species. Amongst all recorded
   indicator plants, 32\% were native species.}},

Abstract = {{Offering more floral resources for urban bees can be achieved by growing
   ornamental bee plants. The aim of the present study was to evaluate
   selected Asteraceae (Calendula officinalis `Persimmon Beauty' and
   `Santana', Centaurea macrocephala, Cosmos sulphureus, Dahlia pinnata,
   Tagetes patula, Tithonia rotundifolia, and Zinnia elegans) as pollen
   sources for pollinators. Under urban conditions in Lublin, SE Poland,
   the investigated plants flowered from late June to the end of October.
   The mass of pollen produced in florets and capitula was found to be
   species-related. The highest pollen amounts per 10 florets (10.1 mg) as
   well as per capitulum (249.7 mg) were found for C. macrocephala. The
   mass of pollen yielded by a single plant depended on both the pollen
   mass delivered per disk florets and the proportion of disk florets in
   capitulum, and the flowering abundance of the plants. A single plant of
   D. pinnata and a single plant of T. rotundifolia each produced the
   largest pollen mass. Mean pollen yield per 1m(2) of a plot ranged from
   6.2 g (Z. elegans) to 60.7 g (D. pinnata). Pollen grains are
   tricolporate, with echinate exine, medium or small in size. They can be
   categorised as oblatespherical, spherical, and prolatespherical. The
   principal visitors to C. macrocephala, C. sulphureus, and C. officinalis
   were honey bees, whereas bumble bees dominated on T. rotundifolia and D.
   pinnata. A magnet plant for butterflies was Z. elegans. Among the
   investigated species, D. pinnata, C. macrocephala, and T. rotundifolia
   were found to be the most valuable sources of pollen flow for managed
   and wild bees.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Plant size has been hypothesized to be a major driver of biotic
   interactions. However, it is little understood how plant size affects
   plant mutualists vs. antagonists and the plant's resulting reproductive
   success. We established a common garden experiment covering an
   interspecific plant size gradient (from 10 to 130 cm height) across 21
   annual Brassicaceae species, thereby standardizing features of habitat
   and surrounding landscape. We assessed flower-visiting pollinators and
   florivores (pollen beetle adults and larvae) and the resulting effects
   of all these flower-visiting insects on plant reproductive success.
   Besides flower characteristics (size, abundance, color), plant size had
   a generally positive effect on abundance and species richness of
   pollinators as well as on abundance of pollen beetle adults and larvae.
   Pollen beetles reduced seed number as well as thousand-seed weight,
   whereas pollinators increased seed number only. Overall, increasing
   plant size led to less thousand-seed weight but had no effect on seed
   number, indicating counterbalancing effects of herbivory and
   pollination. In conclusion, seed number of large plant species should
   benefit from locations with many pollinators and few herbivores and
   small plant species' seed number from locations with few pollinators and
   many herbivores.}},

Title = {{Bumble bee species exhibit divergent responses to urbanisation in a
   Southern California landscape}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{685-692}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Bees are ecologically important pollinators that are threatened by
   disease, habitat degradation, and habitat loss. Bee species that share
   ecological traits (e.g. body size, diet breadth, and sociality) may
   often respond similarly to environmental disturbance; however, few
   studies have examined the extent to which closely related, ecologically
   similar species exhibit divergent responses to the same forms of
   disturbance.
   2. In the present study, the responses of bumble bees (Apidae: genus
   Bombus) to urbanization are examined by combining field surveys with the
   quantification of localand landscape-level variables using Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS). During the spring and summer of 2012 and
   2013, 57, bumble bees were surveyed in 1-ha plots in San Diego County,
   California that spanned a gradient of urbanisation. Species-level,
   occurrence (presence/absence) data and logistic regressions were then
   used to identify determinants of Bombus occurrence across this
   landscape.
   3. Approximately 1000 Bombus individuals belonging to three species were
   observed: B. californicus Smith, B. melanopygus Cresson, and B.
   vosnesenskii Radoszkowski. The occurrence of all Bombus species was
   negatively related to impermeable surface cover within study plots, but
   species responded uniquely to other plot-scale variables and exhibited
   distinctive patterns of scale-dependency with respect to impermeable
   surface cover surrounding plots.
   4. Urbanisation negatively affected all three focal bumble bee species
   in this study. Species-specific responses to plot-scale and
   landscape-scale variables presumably reflect interspecific trait
   differences (e.g. body size, tongue length, and foraging behaviour).
   Unique responses to urbanisation caution against pooling species into
   functional groups based merely on taxonomic relationships or perceived
   ecological similarities.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate aerobiological dynamics of
   pollen in the Mediterranean part of Croatia in the air of the city of
   Split. Pollen monitoring during the period from 2005 to 2013 was
   performed using a Hirst volumetric trap. Among the identified pollen of
   50 taxa, 21 were allergenic. The average annual pollen index was 33,513.
   Three pollination seasons were established: early winter season
   dominated by tree pollen, spring-summer season dominated by herbaceous
   plants and summer-autumn season with lower amounts of Parietaria and
   Cupressaceae pollen. According to the abundance, the main taxa were:
   Cupressaceae, Parietaria/Urtica, Pinus, Quercus, Olea, Carpinus/Ostrya,
   Poaceae, Platanus and Ambrosia. The annual pollen index together with
   the daily maximum concentrations showed an upward trend for selected
   taxa during the study period. The highest monthly pollen index and the
   highest biodiversity were recorded in April and the lowest during the
   late autumn and winter months. The pollen calendar created for the city
   of Split confirmed Mediterranean features of the pollen spectrum. The
   longest pollen seasons were recorded for Cupressaceae, Parietaria/Urtica
   and Poaceae pollen types. The correlations between pollen concentrations
   and meteorological parameters were analyzed. The correlations between
   pollen concentrations and temperature were positive, while the humidity
   and the precipitation mostly showed negative influence.}},

Abstract = {{As deforestation and urbanization continue at rapid rates in tropical
   regions, urban forest patches are essential repositories of
   biodiversity. However, almost nothing is known about gene flow of
   forest-dependent tree species in urban landscapes. In this study, we
   investigated gene flow in the insect-pollinated, wind-dispersed tropical
   tree Koompassia malaccensis in and among three remnant forest patches in
   the urbanized landscape of Singapore. We genotyped the vast majority of
   adults (N = 179) and a large number of recruits (N = 2103) with 8 highly
   polymorphic microsatellite markers. Spatial genetic structure of the
   recruit and adult cohorts was significant, showing routine gene
   dispersal distances of similar to 100-400 m. Parentage analysis showed
   that 97\% of recruits were within 100 m of their mother tree, and a high
   frequency of relatively short-distance pollen dispersal (median similar
   to 143-187 m). Despite routine seed and pollen dispersal distances of
   within a few hundred meters, interpatch gene flow occurred between all
   patches and was dominated by pollen movement: parentage analysis showed
   76 pollen versus 2 seed interpatch dispersal events, and the seedling
   neighborhood model estimated similar to 1-6\% seed immigration and
   similar to 21-46\% pollen immigration rates, depending on patch. In
   addition, the smallest patch (containing five adult K. malaccensis
   trees) was entirely surrounded by 42.5 km of `impervious' substrate, yet
   had the highest proportional pollen and seed immigration estimates of
   any patch. Hence, contrary to our hypothesis, insect-mediated gene flow
   persisted across an urban landscape, and several of our results also
   parallel key findings from insect-pollinated canopy trees sampled in
   mixed agricultural-forest landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Flowering synchrony has a relevant role in pollinator attraction. In
   distylous species, synchronous blooming between individuals of both
   morphs means that the chances of intermorph crosses are increased, which
   is important for the maintenance of the heterostylous system. The aim of
   the present study was to describe the flowering phonology and the
   behavior of the floral visitors in three populations of Psychotria
   carthagenensis Jacq. (Rubiaceae) between January 2008 and January 2010.
   Flower and pollinator censuses were conducted at three urban forest
   fragments in Brazil. Psychotria carthagenensis flowering occurred
   between October and December, with a high degree of synchrony within
   populations as well as between floral morphs. The exotic Apis mellifera
   L. (Apidae) was the main pollinator in the three populations. A high
   degree of similarity was found in the behavior of floral visitors as
   well as in nectar production. Visitation rates did not differ between
   floral morphs. Similar floral recompenses (flower availability and
   nectar) as well as no preference in pollinators' visiting are thought to
   be contributing to a greater intermorph visitation to pin and thrum
   flowers in P. carthagenensis.}},

Title = {{Saproxylic Beetle Biodiversity in Golf Course Habitats}},
Journal = {{CROP FORAGE \& TURFGRASS MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Saproxylic beetles are a diverse group of insects that use deadwood as
   food or habitat at some stage of their life. While a few species of
   saproxylic beetles are considered to be pests, the majority of species
   perform important ecological roles such as decomposition, nutrient
   recycling, pollination in the mobile adult form, or act as food sources
   for other organisms. Their diversity and variable responses make them
   good biological indicators. Promoting biodiversity in managed areas,
   such as golf courses, may be relatively easy by creating saproxylic
   habitat. We examined the influence on saproxylic beetle communities of
   habitat type, log type, and distance from a fairway. Sentinel logs were
   provided for colonization for one season, and emergence was monitored
   over the following 2 years. We found that beetle species richness
   increased with log volume but did not change with distance from the
   fairway playing surface. Our findings suggest that although species
   richness may be low compared with that in less fragmented habitats, a
   diverse assortment of saproxylic beetles can be supported in golf course
   wooded habitats. This may be accomplished by leaving fallen trees in
   place when they do not pose a hazard or interfere with play. In
   particular, the provision of large woody debris that is more difficult
   to remove may maximize the benefit to superintendents and the saproxylic
   beetle community. Findings also support the idea that golf courses
   containing woody patches may increase habitat connectivity for these
   insects, and possibly other organisms, in otherwise highly fragmented
   urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{Woody plants host diverse communities of associated organisms, including
   wood inhabiting fungi. In this group, host effects on species richness
   and interaction network structure are not well understood, especially
   not at large geographical scales.
   We investigated ecological, historical and evolutionary determinants of
   fungal species richness and network modularity, that is, subcommunity
   structure, across woody hosts in Denmark, using a citizen science data
   set comprising > 80 000 records of > 1000 fungal species on 91 genera of
   woody plants.
   Fungal species richness was positively related to host size, wood pH,
   and the number of species in the host genus, with limited influence of
   host frequency and host history, that is, time since host establishment
   in the area. Modularity patterns were unaffected by host history, but
   largely reflected host phylogeny. Notably, fungal communities differed
   substantially between angiosperm and gymnosperm hosts.
   Host traits and evolutionary history appear to be more important than
   host frequency and recent history in structuring interactions between
   hosts and wood-inhabiting fungi. High wood acidity appears to act as a
   stress factor reducing fungal species richness, while large host size,
   providing increased niche diversity, enhances it. In some fungal groups
   that are known to interact with live host cells in the establishment
   phase, host selectivity is common, causing a modular community
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Urban neighborhoods vary in development intensity and in the life style
   and demographics of their residents. Decisions made by urban residents
   affect plant communities, their functional characteristics, and the
   floral resources they provide. We recorded flowers in front-facing yards
   in 58 neighborhoods in Chicago, IL (USA) and examined patterns in
   community composition and species turnover between neighborhoods. We
   investigated how species richness and plant characteristics, including
   origin, cultivation intent, and life cycle, are affected by neighborhood
   socioeconomic factors. Urban plant species tended to be perennial,
   ornamental, and non-native. White clover had the broadest distribution
   and the highest floral abundance but was not present in several of the
   highest-income neighborhoods. Although we found 144 morpho-species
   across neighborhoods, most occurred infrequently. Species turnover was
   highest for ornamental species and lowest for weedy species, suggesting
   that intentional plantings are driving beta diversity across the
   landscape. We found the highest species richness in neighborhoods with
   intermediate numbers of Hispanic and white residents and with
   intermediate number of residential lots; neighborhoods with racially or
   ethnically homogenous populations had fewer plant species. The high
   frequency of weeds in low-income neighborhoods, the occurrence of
   certain ornamental plant species in whiter, wealthier communities, and
   high turnover of species from one neighborhood to another, all suggest a
   disparity in plant-related ecosystem services across cities. Complexity
   in urban plantings may be influenced by the suite of perspectives that
   residents bring towards habitat management. Cultivation sustains a
   diversity of plants and creates a disparity in plant traits by
   neighborhood socioeconomics.}},

Abstract = {{Cities are habitats created almost exclusively for a single species,
   Homo sapiens. However, the mosaic-like character of urban environments
   may create favourable living conditions for various populations of bees.
   Due to the negative impact of intensified agriculture and landscape
   fragmentation on pollinator insects, interest in urban areas as refuges
   for local bee fauna is growing. The author's three-year research has
   shown that the distance of a bee community from a large green space with
   direct connection to suburban areas is the decisive factor for bee
   species richness in a city. The proximity of such green space areas
   facilities penetration of species into cities. As for the density of
   bees in the urban environment, it was largely determined by host plant
   cover. These data are of practical importance, as they may be used in
   future urban green space planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{Abundance and diversity of bumblebees have been declining over the past
   decades. To successfully conserve bumblebee populations, we need to
   understand how landscape characteristics affect the quantity and quality
   of floral resources collected by colonies and subsequently colony
   performance.
   We therefore investigated how amount and composition of pollen collected
   by buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris colonies was affected by the
   surrounding landscape (i.e. the proportion of forest, urban,
   semi-natural habitats) and how they were related to colony growth.
   Thirty B. terrestris colonies were placed at grassland sites differing
   in surrounding landscape. Colonies were established in spring when
   availability of flowering plants was highest, and their weight gain was
   monitored for 1 month. We additionally recorded the quantity and
   compared plant taxonomic composition and nutritional quality (i.e. amino
   acid composition) of pollen stored.
   Bumblebee colonies varied little in the pollen spectra collected despite
   differences in surrounding landscape composition. They collected on
   average 80 \% of pollen from woody plants, with 34 \% belonging to the
   genus Acer. Early colony growth positively correlated with total amount
   of woody pollen and protein collected and decreased with increasing
   proportions of semi-natural habitats and total amino acid
   concentrations.
   Our results suggest that woody plant species represent highly important
   pollen sources for the generalist forager B. terrestris early in the
   season. We further show that colony growth of B. terrestris is
   predominantly affected by the quantity, not quality, of forage,
   indicating that several abundant plant species flowering throughout the
   bumblebees' foraging season may cover the colonies' nutritional needs.}},

Abstract = {{Light pollution is a global change affecting a major proportion of
   global land surface. Although the impacts of Artificial Light At Night
   (ALAN) have been documented locally for many taxa, the extent of effect
   of ALAN at a landscape scale on biodiversity is unknown.
   We characterized the landscape-scale impacts of ALAN on 4 insectivorous
   bat species Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Pipistrellus kuhlii, Eptesicus
   serotinus, Nyctalus leisleri, and compared the extent of their effects
   to other major land-use pressures.
   We used a French national-scale monitoring program recording bat
   activity among 2-km car transect surveys, and extracted landscape
   characteristics around transects with satellite and land cover layers.
   For each species, we performed multi-model averaging at 4 landscape
   scales (from 200 to 1000 m buffers around transects) to compare the
   relative effects of the average radiance, the proportion of impervious
   surface and the proportion of intensive agriculture.
   For all species, ALAN had a stronger negative effect than impervious
   surface at the 4 landscape scales tested. This effect was weaker than
   the effect of intensive agriculture. The negative effect of ALAN was
   significant for P. pipistrellus, P. kuhlii and E. serotinus, but not for
   N. leisleri. The effect of impervious surface varied among species while
   intensive agriculture had a significant negative effect on the 4
   species.
   Our results highlight the need to consider the impacts of ALAN on
   biodiversity in land-use planning and suggest that using only impervious
   surface as a proxy for urbanization may lead to underestimated impacts
   on biodiversity.}},

Title = {{A quantitative assessment of policy options for no net loss of
   biodiversity and ecosystem services in the European Union}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{151-163}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{The Biodiversity Strategy of the European Union includes a target to
   ``ensure no-net-loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services by 2020{''}.
   Many policy options can be envisioned to achieve such a no-net-loss
   target, mainly acting on land use and land management. To assess the
   effectiveness of such policies at a European Union (EU) scale, we
   simulated land use changes and their impacts on biodiversity and
   ecosystem services indicators. We analysed a Business-as-Usual scenario,
   and three no-net-loss scenarios. The no-net-loss scenarios included
   measures that aim to reduce negative impacts of land use change on
   biodiversity and ecosystem services, by better implementation of
   existing biodiversity conservation measures (Scenario 1); and
   enhancement of existing measures (Scenario 2); and offsetting residual
   impacts on areas of high biodiversity and ecosystem service value
   (Scenario 3).
   Results show that none of the scenarios achieved overall no-net-loss.
   Compared to a Business-as-Usual scenario, the no-net-loss scenarios
   reduced the overall degree of land cover change at EU level, hence
   reducing impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services in large parts
   of the EU. The more comprehensive no-net-loss scenarios resulted in a
   gain of natural land cover. Moreover, natural areas became better
   connected, especially in pen-urban areas as a result of impact avoidance
   and offsetting. Richness of farmland bird species was projected to
   increase. Measures included in the no-net-loss scenarios had net
   positive effects on pollination and carbon sequestration, neutral
   effects on crop production, erosion prevention and flood regulation, and
   negative effects on nature-based recreation, compared to
   Business-as-Usual. In particular circumstances policy measures invoked
   displacement effects in land use allocation, reducing the effectiveness
   of the measures. This was primarily the case for flood regulation
   services throughout the EU.
   This study differentiates the potential effectiveness of a no-net-loss
   policy framework in three manners: (i) considering biodiversity and
   ecosystem services simultaneously; (ii) in the light of existing
   policies and land use pressures; and (iii) in different land use
   contexts across the EU. Taken together, we conclude that achieving
   no-net-loss for biodiversity and ecosystem services throughout the EU
   remains challenging given high land use demands. Nevertheless, in large
   parts of Europe there appears room for improvement for certain kinds of
   biodiversity and ecosystem services compared to Business-as-Usual, while
   still meeting other land use demands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Disentangling urban habitat and matrix effects on wild bee species}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{In face of a dramatic decline of wild bee species in many rural
   landscapes, potential conservation functions of urban areas gain
   importance. Yet effects of urbanization on pollinators, and in
   particular on wild bees remain ambiguous and not comprehensively
   understood. This is especially true for amenity grassland and
   extensively managed wastelands within large-scale residential housing
   areas. Using Berlin as a study region we aimed to investigate (a) if
   these greenspaces are accepted by wild bee assemblages as foraging
   habitats; (b) how assemblage structure of bees and individual bee
   species are affected by different habitat (e.g., management, flower
   density) and urban matrix variables (e.g., isolation, urbanization); and
   (c) to what extent grassland restoration can promote bees in urban
   environments. In summer 2012, we collected 62 bee species belonging to
   more than 20\% of the taxa known for Berlin. Urbanization significantly
   affected species composition of bees; 18 species were affiliated to
   different levels of urbanization. Most bee species were not affected by
   any of the environmental variables tested, and urbanization had a
   negative effect only for one bee species. Further, we determined that
   restoration of diverse grasslands positively affected bee species
   richnesss in urban environments. We conclude that differently structured
   and managed greenspaces in large-scale housing areas can provide
   additional foraging habitats and refuges for pollinators. This supports
   approaches towards a biodiversity friendly management within urban
   regions and may be of particular importance given that anthropogenic
   pressure is increasing in many rural landscapes.}},

   disturbance-adapted, hawkmoth-pollinated plant species}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1950-1963}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Land-use change is cited as a primary driver of
   global biodiversity loss, with myriad consequences for species,
   populations, and ecosystems. However, few studies have examined its
   impact on species interactions, particularly pollination. Furthermore,
   when the effects of land-use change on pollination have been studied,
   the focus has largely been on species pollinated by diurnal pollinators,
   namely, bees and butterflies. Here, we focus on Oenothera harringtonii,
   a night-flowering, disturbance-adapted species that has experienced a
   range-wide gradient of land-use change. We tested the hypothesis that
   the negative impacts of land-use change are mitigated by long-distance
   pollination.
   METHODS: Our study included both temporal (4yr) and spatial (19
   populations range-wide, and 1,2, and 5 km from the population center)
   data, providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of land-use
   change on pollination biology and reproduction.
   KEY RESULTS: We first confirmed that O. harringtonii is
   self-incompatible and reliant on pollinators for reproduction. We then
   showed that hawkmoths (primarily Hyles lineata) are highly reliable and
   effective pollinators in both space and time. Unlike other studies, we
   did not detect an effect of population size, increased isolation, or a
   reduction in suitable habitat in areas with evidence of land-use change
   on pollination ( visitation, pollen removal and deposition).
   Furthermore, the proportion of suitable habitat and other fragmentation
   metrics examined were not associated with population size or density in
   this plant species.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that nocturnal pollination of Oenothera
   harringtonii via hawkmoths is robust to the negative impacts of land-use
   change.}},

   textual analysis of the most comprehensive database available. In the
   continental US plants are most commonly threatened by outdoor recreation
   (affecting 35\% of species), especially from off-road vehicles (19\%)
   and hiking and related activities (13\%). The next-most common threats
   are from livestock (33\%), residential development (28\%), non-native
   invasives (27\%), and roads (21\%). In Hawaii invasives threaten 95\% of
   species followed by increases in fire intensity/frequency (26\%) then
   livestock (19\%). Multivariate analyses indicate threats do not form
   distinct ``syndromes{''} (clusters of threats) but rather a single
   ``mega-syndrome{''} with high degrees of overlap between most threats.
   We also compared the prevalence of threats to the distribution of
   research effort. Nearly 75\% of threats are understudied relative to
   their prevalence, including five of the six most common threats while a
   few rare threats (missing species like pollinators; pathogens; logging;
   climate-induced ecosystem movement; and crop-based agriculture) receive
   most of the attention. In comparison to a benchmark assessment from 1998
   (Wilcove et al. BioScience 48:607-615) we find little difference in
   threat prevalence, though temporal trends suggest increasing frequency
   of nearly all threats. Overall rare plants in the US are affected by a
   dense network of threats across which research attention is
   disproportionately directed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hummingbirds are the most common group of vertebrate pollinators in the
   Neotropics, associated with pollination of ornithophilous flowers. The
   group can be divided into hermits and non-hermits, in which hermits are
   often regarded as the most specialized group closely associated with
   more specialized ornithophilous plants. In this study, we investigated
   the association of ornithophilous flowers and hummingbirds in two small
   fragments of forest surrounded by an urban matrix. We characterized the
   species composition, abundance and phenology of the hummingbirds and
   ornithophilous plants and related pollinator abundance to floral
   resource availability. Our results were compared to published data from
   other forest areas from the Cerrado. In our study areas, the diversity
   of ornithophilous plants and hummingbirds was similar to what has been
   reported for forest fragments in the Cerrado. Nevertheless, we found
   Thalurania furcata, a non-hermit, acting as the most frequent
   hummingbird pollinator in contrast to more preserved areas in which a
   hermit, Phaethornis pretrei, is commonly found as the main pollinator
   for ornithophilous plants. The nectar energy availability at the plant
   population level was the only factor associated with hummingbird
   visitation rates, suggesting that a higher availability of nectar
   resources in the fragments attracts greater abundance of birds. The
   unusual setting of having a non-hermit species as the main hummingbird
   pollinator in forest areas suggests that habitat fragmentation can favor
   more generalist hummingbird species, and this potentially has
   consequence for the pollination of associated plants.}},

Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{819-830}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recent decades have seen an expanding literature exploring urban energy
   and material flows, loosely branded as urban metabolism analysis.
   However, this has occurred largely in parallel to the mainstream studies
   of cities as ecosystems. This paper aims to conceptually bridge these
   two distinctive fields of research, by (a) identifying the common
   aspects between them; (b) identifying key characteristics of urban
   ecosystems that can be derived from energy and material flow analysis,
   namely energy and material budget and pathways; flow intensity; energy
   and material efficiency; rate of resource depletion, accumulation and
   transformation; self-sufficiency or external dependency; intra-system
   heterogeneity; intersystem and temporal variation; and regulating
   mechanism and governing capacity. I argue that significant ecological
   insight can be, or has the potential to be, drawn from the rich and
   rapidly growing empirical findings of urban metabolism studies to
   understand the behaviour of cities as human-dominated, complex systems.
   A closer intellectual linkage and cross pollination between urban
   metabolism and urban ecosystem studies will advance our scientific
   understanding and better inform urban policy and management practices.}},

Title = {{Flowery Porn: Form and Desire in Erasmus Darwin's The Loves of the
   Plants}},
Journal = {{LITERATURE COMPASS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{When Erasmus Darwin announces that the general design of The Loves of
   the Plants is to inlist Imagination under the banner of Science (ii), an
   echo of the Song of Solomon (itself a touchstone for eroticized
   botanical imagery) reveals how charged the relationship is: his banner
   over me was love (2:4). This essay argues that taking The Loves of the
   Plants seriously as an erotic work reveals the essential importance of
   desire to the evolving diversity of vibrant life it envisions and to the
   interdisciplinarity it achieves. Not only does the poem popularize the
   Linnaean sexual system of taxonomy by infusing it with sensibility,
   creating a landscape driven by desire. The form of the poem makes a
   mixed marriage of art and science, verse and footnotes, in a
   tantalizingly episodic (non-)structure which could be called
   pornographic. The relationships between the male and female parts of an
   overwhelming variety of flora are much more varied than the conventional
   gender roles later critics have often ascribed to the poem. Yet, while
   each vignette offers another sexual permutation, the cumulative effect
   blurs variety into sameness, an effect earlier recognized by John
   Cleland in Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure. Cleland extends the boredom
   to style, citing the flatness, in inevitable repetition, of the
   vocabulary of pleasure. The descent of Darwin's poetry into
   unfashionability under Wordsworthian aesthetics is also the demise of an
   erotic interdisciplinarity. In addition to the stylistic simultaneity of
   variety and sameness, Darwin's footnotes, epic similes and tangents are
   driven from topic to topic by a kind of unchaste curiosity which
   flattens borders demarcating species, subject headings, legitimate
   attractions. The Loves, both desire and the poem itself, laugh at all,
   but Nature's laws (IV:486). Even Nature's laws play loose with
   categories, as pollinating insects are seduced by flowers. This article
   examines how The Loves of the Plants envisions a continuum of life forms
   and of disciplines by portraying and performing cross-species erotic
   interaction. Personification of vegetable reproduction invites readers
   to conceive of their own desire in botanic terms (as, indeed, readers
   and parodists did). Fascination with hybridization epitomizes both
   Darwin's poetry and his science, from the remarkable love affair between
   nightingale and rose which produces the bird-flower offspring
   fantastically described in Loves, to the painstaking study of
   cross-breeding in the evolutionarily crucial chapter Of Generation in
   Zoonomia.}},

Abstract = {{Brood pollination mutualisms-interactions in which specialized insects
   are both the pollinators (as adults) and seed predators (as larvae) of
   their host plants-have been influential study systems for coevolutionary
   biology. These mutualisms include those between figs and fig wasps,
   yuccas and yucca moths, leafflowers and leafflower moths, globeflowers
   and globeflower flies, Silene plants and Hadena and Perizoma moths,
   saxifrages and Greya moths, and senita cacti and senita moths. The high
   reciprocal diversity and species-specificity of some of these mutualisms
   have been cited as evidence that coevolution between plants and
   pollinators drives their mutual diversification. However, the mechanisms
   by which these mutualisms diversify have received less attention. In
   this paper, we review key hypotheses about how these mutualisms
   diversify and what role coevolution between plants and pollinators may
   play in this process. We find that most species-rich brood pollination
   mutualisms show significant phylogenetic congruence at high taxonomic
   scales, but there is limited evidence for the processes of both
   cospeciation and duplication, and there are no unambiguous examples
   known of strict-sense contemporaneous cospeciation. Allopatric
   speciation appears important across multiple systems, particularly in
   the insects. Host-shifts appear to be common, and widespread host-shifts
   by pollinators may displace other pollinator lineages. There is
   relatively little evidence for a ``coevolution through cospeciation{''}
   model or that coevolution promotes speciation in these systems. Although
   we have made great progress in understanding the mechanisms by which
   brood pollination mutualisms diversify, many opportunities remain to use
   these intriguing symbioses to understand the role of biotic interactions
   in generating biological diversity.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1803-1809}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Specialized brood pollination systems involve both
   mutualism and antagonism in the overall interaction and have led to
   diversification in both plants and insects. Although largely known for
   mutualism, the role of the antagonistic side of the interaction in these
   systems has been overlooked. Specialization may be driven by plant
   defenses to feeding by the insect larvae that consume and kill
   developing plant ovules. The interaction among yuccas and yucca moths is
   cited as a classic example of the importance of mutualism in
   specialization and diversification. Pollinators moths are very host
   specific, but whether this specificity is due to adult pollination
   ability or larval feeding ability is unclear. Here, I test the potential
   role of antagonism in driving specialization among yuccas and yucca
   moths.
   METHODS: I examined the ability of the most-polyphagous yucca moth
   pollinator, Tegeticula yuccasella, to pollinate and develop on five
   Yucca species used across its range. Yucca species endemic to the Great
   Plains and Texas were transplanted to a common garden in Syracuse, New
   York and exposed to the local pollinator moth population over 3 years.
   KEY RESULTS: Local moths visited all but one of the Yucca species, but
   had drastically lower rates of successful larval development on
   non-natal Yucca species in comparison to the local host species.
   CONCLUSION: Specialization in many brood pollination systems may be
   strongly influenced by the antagonistic rather than the mutualistic side
   of the overall interaction, suggesting that antagonistic coevolution is
   a possible source of diversification.}},

Abstract = {{This is an artist's text where an experimental filmmaker explores
   cosmopolitanism in her own work and that of others. Talking about
   eclectic cosmopolitan theory, this article maps the role of the wanderer
   in literature and film. Investigating the cross-pollination of image,
   sound and text in experimental filmmaking, the writer charts her own
   position as a mediator of cultural elements in a globalised world, and
   the implications of feminist subjectivity. The article charts the making
   of the author's cosmopolitan films made between the late 1980s and 2015,
   as well as the development of a practice that reflects a transnational
   consciousness. The text embeds a discussion of diaspora, and of
   appropriation and citation as the inevitable result of accelerated media
   profusion. Jewish identity is explored through text, and a dialogue with
   the world, refracted through subjective bricolage. A contextual
   introduction to the author's films, this text explores diaspora,
   nomadism and Jewish and feminist consciousness in a globalised world.
   The film draws on eclectic sources to describe an identity in flux and a
   rhizomatic rather than rootless relation to diaspora. The text
   references Henry James, Rosi Braidotti, Jacques Derrida, Chris Kraus and
   others to sketch a transnational vision of twenty-first-century
   cosmopolitanism and ecriture feminine.}},

Abstract = {{Induction of haploid plants in fruit crops through gamma irradiated
   pollen technique is of paramount importance in modern fruit breeding to
   reduce the breeding cycle. But the major problem of this technique is
   the sensitivity of pollen grains to higher irradiation doses. Present

   growth of gamma ray irradiated pollens of 2 different Citrus species: C.
   limetta, and C. sinensis. Both viability and in vitro germination
   capacity of irradiated pollen decreased gradually with increasing
   concentrations of irradiation in both the pollen parent; however, at
   highest irradiation dose (400 Gy), reduction of pollen viability and in
   vitro germination capacity, as compared to respective controls was

   incubation, was found maximum in C. limetta (267.83, 303.24 and 325.57
   mu m, respectively). Our experiment revealed that pollen of C. limetta
   has higher resistance to gamma ray irradiation as compared to C.
   sinensis, hence C. limetta can be employed as more reliable pollen
   parent in haploidy programme of Citrus.}},

Title = {{Food Chain Restoration for Pollinators: Regional Habitat Recovery
   Strategies Involving Protected Areas of the Southwest}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{The steep declines over the last quarter century of wild pollinators in
   the Southwest among native bees, monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus
   L.), hummingbirds, and nectar-feeding bats have come during a time of
   accelerated climate change, and are likely due to a variety of stresses
   interacting with climatic shifts. Nevertheless, there is mounting
   evidence that declining availability and altered timing of floral
   resources along ``nectar corridors{''} accessible to pollinators
   involves climatic shifts as a serious stressor that had been previously
   underestimated. Longitudinal studies from both urban heat islands and
   rural habitats in Southwestern North America suggest peak flowering of
   many wildflowers serving as floral resources for pollinators is
   occurring three to five weeks earlier in spring than a century ago,
   leaving ``phenological gaps{''} in nectar resource availability for
   certain pollinators. To avoid the threat of what A. Dobson (Professor of
   Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University) and others have
   termed ``food web collapse,{''} a range of groups have initiated
   ecological restoration efforts in semi-arid zones that attempt to (a)
   assemble more resilient plant-pollinator food chains, and (b)
   hydrologically restore watercourses to ensure water scarcity will be
   less likely to disrupt re-assembled food chains in the face of droughts,
   catastrophic floods, and other correlates of global climate change. We
   recommend ``bottom-up food chain restoration{''} strategies for
   restoring nectar corridors in protected areas on or near geopolitical
   and land management boundaries in all regions, but particularly in the
   Southwest or US-Mexico desert border states. We highlight binational and
   multicultural workshops facilitated to communicate about, and initiate
   restoration of, mutualistic relationships among plants, pollinators, and
   people to protected area managers on both sides of the border.}},

Journal = {{ECOSYSTEM SERVICES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{6-19}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Using various sources of information, we reviewed the literature about
   the economic valuation of ecosystem services in Mexico. The objectives
   were to analyze the diversity and consistency of value estimations,
   identify research gaps, and suggest directions for future research. We
   found 43 studies that used non -market valuation methods to estimate the
   economic benefits of 24 types of ecosystem services. The most evaluated
   service was recreation, followed by water and food resources. Contingent
   valuation was the most cited method, followed by travel cost and choice
   experiment methods. While the number of studies is encouraging, many
   important ecosystem services still remain unnoticed and are not
   accounting towards the total economic value (e.g. pollination, medicine,
   bioenergy, etc.). In addition, the majority of studies revealed a lack
   of validity tests, which challenges the reliability of results.
   Hypothetical bias and the embedding effect are serious problems that
   must be addressed in future stated preference studies. Considering the
   issues reviewed here, we believe that the scientific community in Mexico
   should keep doing more research on economic valuation. This information
   can help to transit from hypothetical to real markets and to highlight
   the critical role of ecosystem services in society. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1003-1015}},

Abstract = {{We performed a BLAST search of the rice database and screened four group
   3 late embryogenesis abundant genes (OsG3LEA-47.3, OsG3LEA-41.9,
   OsG3LEA-20.5, and OsG3LEA-24.5) that shared characteristics of canonical
   G3LEAs such as multiple copies of consensus motif, hydrophilic,
   structural intrinsic disorder, thermostability, abscisic acid
   (ABA)-responsiveness, and high G and C content in gene sequence. Under
   nonstress conditions, OsG3LEA-20.5 and OsG3LEA-24.5 were constitutively
   expressed, whereas OsG3LEA-47.3 and OsG3LEA-41.9 were expressed in a
   stage- or tissue-specific manner. Transcripts of OsG3LEA-20.5 and
   OsG3LEA-24.5 accumulated under salt, ABA, and cold stress treatment. By
   contrast, OsG3LEA-47.3 and OsG3LEA-41.9 showed less responsiveness to
   stress in tillering and heading stages, respectively. All genes showed
   enhanced transcript levels after pollination and embryo development. To
   investigate the functions, we overexpressed OsG3LEA-47.3, OsG3LEA-41.9,
   OsG3LEA-20.5, and OsG3LEA-24.5 in Arabidopsis (47.3-ox, 41.9-ox,
   20.5-ox, and 24.5-ox). Analysis of tolerance to drought stress revealed
   higher recovery after 14 days of dehydration treatment for 47.3-ox or
   41.9-ox than the wild type (WT), 20.5-ox, or 24.5-ox. In addition,
   47.3-ox and 24.5-ox plants showed higher survival than WT, 41.9-ox, and
   20.5-ox plants under heat treatment, which induced similar expression
   patterns of heat shock protein genes in WT, 47.3-ox, 41.9-ox, 20.5-ox,
   and 24.5-ox plants. In vitro chaperone activity with the model substrate
   citrate synthase was comparable between OsG3LEA-47.3 and OsHSP16.9A, a
   rice molecular chaperone providing thermoprotection in vivo and in
   vitro. These results suggest that rice G3LEAs share many physical and
   biological features but function in contrasting ways.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization requires the conversion of natural land cover to cover with
   human-constructed elements and is considered a major threat to
   biodiversity. Bee populations, globally, are under threat; however, the
   effect of rapid urban expansion in Southeast Asia on bee diversity has
   not been investigated. Given the pressing issues of bee conservation and
   urbanization in Southeast Asia, coupled with complex factors surrounding
   human-bee coexistence, we investigated bee diversity and human
   perceptions of bees in four megacities. We sampled bees and conducted
   questionnaires at three different site types in each megacity: a
   botanical garden, central business district, and peripheral suburban
   areas. Overall, the mean species richness and abundance of bees were
   significantly higher in peripheral suburban areas than central business
   districts; however, there were no significant differences in the mean
   species richness and abundance between botanical gardens and peripheral
   suburban areas or botanical gardens and central business districts.
   Urban residents were unlikely to have seen bees but agreed that bees
   have a right to exist in their natural environment. Residents who did
   notice and interact with bees, even though being stung, were more likely
   to have positive opinions towards the presence of bees in cities.}},

Abstract = {{Flupyradifurone (Sivanto) is a novel systemic insecticide from the
   butenolide class developed by Bayer. Based on available data (USEPA
   2014), this insecticide appears to have a favorable safety profile for
   honey bee colonies. As a result, the label permits the product to be
   applied during prebloom and bloom in various crops, including citrus,
   except when mixed with azole fungicides during the blooming period. We
   placed 24 honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies adjacent to eight
   flowering buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) fields that either had
   been sprayed with the maximum label rate of flupyradifurone or with
   water only (control fields), with three colonies placed adjacent to each
   field. We conducted colony strength assessments during which the number
   of adult bees, eggs, uncapped brood cells, capped brood cells, food
   storage cells, and weights of honey supers and brood chambers were
   determined prior to, during, and after the flowering period. We also
   analyzed bee-collected pollen and nectar for flupyradifurone residues.
   Overall, there were no differences in any colony strength parameter for
   colonies placed at control and flupyradifurone-treated buckwheat fields.
   Residue analyses showed that pollen (x = 565.8 ppb) and nectar (x =
   259.4 ppb) gathered by bees on fields treated with flupyradifurone
   contained significantly higher flupyradifurone residues than did bee
   bread and unprocessed nectar collected by bees from control fields (75\%
   of samples <LOD). Within the conditions set forth by our experimental
   design, our collective data suggest no adverse effects of
   flupyradifurone on honey bee colonies when following label directions.}},

   Overall the dataset included 70 collections (year x sampling site
   combinations) that resulted in 4574 specimens belonging to 195 species.
   We analysed this dataset using data freely available at a national scale
   on agriculture intensity and landscape composition. We found that
   species richness increased with increasing proportion of herbaceous
   semi-natural elements; species dominance decreased with increasing crop
   diversity; the proportion of above ground nesting species and specimens
   increased as the intensity of agricultural practices decreased.
   Comparing the results obtained with identification to species level and
   those obtained with higher taxa or parataxonomic approaches, we found
   that the loss of taxonomic resolution resulted in the non-significance
   of some results on the effects of environmental variables on bee
   assemblage-level attributes. Our study suggests that identification to
   species level is of great importance to detect the effects of global
   change on bees and that an expert-assisted citizen science paradigm
   could provide relevant results to guide conservation measures at a
   national scale.}},

Title = {{Data reliability in citizen science: learning curve and the effects of
   training method, volunteer background and experience on identification
   accuracy of insects visiting ivy flowers}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{1. Citizen science, the involvement of volunteers in collecting of
   scientific data, can be a useful research tool. However, data collected
   by volunteers are often of lower quality than those collected by
   professional scientists.
   2. We studied the accuracy with which the volunteers identified insects
   visiting ivy (Hedera) flowers in Sussex, England. In the first
   experiment, we examined the effects of training method, volunteer
   background and prior experience. Fifty-three participants were trained
   for the same duration using one of three different methods (pamphlet,
   pamphlet + slide show or pamphlet + direct training). Almost immediately
   following training, we tested the ability of the participants to
   identify live insects on ivy flowers to one of 10 taxonomic categories
   and recorded whether their identifications were correct or incorrect,
   without providing feedback.
   3. The results showed that the type of training method had a significant
   effect on identification accuracy (P = 0.008). Participants identified
   79.1\% of insects correctly after using a one-page colour pamphlet,
   85.6\% correctly after using the pamphlet and viewing a slide show and
   94.3\% correctly after using the pamphlet in combination with direct
   training in the field.
   4. As direct training cannot be delivered remotely, in the following
   year we conducted a second experiment, in which a different sample of 26
   volunteers received the pamphlet plus slide show training repeatedly
   three times. Moreover, in this experiment, participants received c. 2
   min of additional training material, either videos of insects or stills
   taken from the videos. Testing showed that identification accuracy
   increased from 88.6\% to 91.3\% to 97.5\% across the three successive
   tests. We also found a borderline significant interaction between the
   type of additional material and the test number (P = 0.053), such that
   the video gave fewer errors than stills in the first two tests only.
   5. The most common errors made by volunteers were misidentifications of
   honeybees and social wasps with their hover fly mimics. We also tested
   six experts who achieved nearly perfect accuracy (99.8\%), which shows
   what is possible in practice.
   6. Overall, our study shows that two or three sessions of remote
   training can be as good as one of direct training, even for relatively
   challenging taxonomic discriminations that include distinguishing models
   and mimics.}},

Title = {{Establishment of classical biological control targeting emerald ash
   borer is facilitated by use of insecticides, with little effect on
   native arthropod communities}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{78-86}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is
   rapidly invading North America and has inflicted extensive ash, Fraxinus
   spp., mortality in affected areas, altering composition and structure of
   wildland and urban forests. Insecticides can effectively protect ash on
   a small scale and classical biological control efforts have been
   implemented. In the U.S. emerald ash borer kills native ash so quickly,
   and populations are so mobile, that establishing an effective biological
   control program is challenging. Consequently, we assessed the
   compatibility of using reduced rates of the insecticide imidacloprid
   applied as a soil drench coupled with releases of three species of
   parasitic wasps. In this way we hope to slow the process of ash decline
   and prolong the window of opportunity to allow biological control agents
   to become established. We compared the efficacy and effects of i) full
   strength imidacloprid applications, ii) reduced rates of imidacloprid
   coupled with classical biological control, iii) classical biological
   control alone, and iv) untreated controls. We monitored emerald ash
   borer adult activity through trapping and destructive sampling for
   larvae, evaluated larval parasitization rates, and also assessed the
   native hymenopteran communities. Chemical treatments were not adequate
   to prevent ash canopy decline, but they also did not impede
   parasitization of emerald ash borer eggs or larvae. Two of the three
   classical biological control agents, Oobius agrili and Tetrastichus
   planipennisi, were recovered from trees treated with imidacloprid,
   demonstrating that they were successfully reproducing and indicating the
   compatibility of the two management strategies. Non-target hymenopterans
   appeared unaffected by the insecticide applications. Importantly we
   found no negative effects of the imidacloprid applications on native
   pollinators. Collectively these data suggest that judicious use of
   insecticides coupled with classical biological control may be an
   effective and potentially sustainable approach to managing invading
   populations of emerald ash borer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Convergent evolution is a process that has occurred throughout the tree
   of life, but the historical genetic and biochemical context promoting
   the repeated independent origins of a trait is rarely understood. The
   well-known stimulant caffeine, and its xanthine alkaloid precursors, has
   evolved multiple times in flowering plant history for various roles in
   plant defense and pollination. We have shown that convergent caffeine
   production, surprisingly, has evolved by two previously unknown
   biochemical pathways in chocolate, citrus, and guarana plants using
   either caffeine synthaseor xanthine methyltransferase-like enzymes.
   However, the pathway and enzyme lineage used by any given plant species
   is not predictable from phylogenetic relatedness alone. Ancestral
   sequence resurrection reveals that this convergence was facilitated by
   co-option of genes maintained over 100 million y for alternative
   biochemical roles. The ancient enzymes of the Citrus lineage were
   exapted for reactions currently used for various steps of caffeine
   biosynthesis and required very few mutations to acquire modern-day
   enzymatic characteristics, allowing for the evolution of a complete
   pathway. Future studies aimed at manipulating caffeine content of plants
   will require the use of different approaches given the metabolic and
   genetic diversity revealed by this study.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of nesting ecology have proven to be extremely important for
   stingless bee conservation. These studies have rarely been conducted in

   Brazil, from May 2008 to April 2009. We recorded the number of nests,
   nest height, species diversity, and nest substrate type (i.e., natural
   or artificial). We compared our results to those of a similar survey
   carried out in the same location eight years prior (2000/2001) in order
   to evaluate how urban expansion on campus has influenced the Meliponini
   bee community. Stingless bee abundance and richness were greater in the
   second survey. The use of natural substrates decreased, while the use of
   artificial substrates increased. This suggests that the increase in
   man-made structures on the UFJF campus has provided favorable sites for
   establishment of some stingless bee species.}},

Title = {{Flower specialization of butterflies and impacts of non-native flower
   use in a transformed tropical landscape}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{201}},
Pages = {{184-191}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Flower-feeding ecology of tropical butterflies remains poorly studied,
   particularly in transformed landscapes, despite that flower availability
   and quality affect important life-history traits and are critical to
   butterfly abundance. We recorded 190 butterfly species feeding on 149
   flowering plant species across forests and urban parks in Singapore.
   Butterflies were classified as flower generalists, intermediates or
   specialists by fitting a power function between the number of flower
   species utilized and the flower visits observed for that butterfly
   species. Generalized least squares models were constructed between the
   degree of flower specialization and traits of butterfly species. Our
   analysis showed that more species were flower generalists than flower
   specialists in both habitat types. Forty-three percent of feeding
   observations in forested sites were on non-native flowers. Yet, flower
   specialists used significantly higher proportions of native flower
   species in their diet than flower generalists and tended to be forest
   dependent. Some forest butterflies were critically dependent (>70\%) on
   single native flower species. Out of 19 butterfly species examined for
   response across habitats, five expanded their diet but six contracted
   their diet with urbanization. The regression models revealed that adult
   conspicuousness, habitat breadth, proboscis length, and wingspan were
   most strongly associated with flower specialization when accounting for
   phylogenetic relatedness. Our results suggest that while landscape
   transformation in the tropics could benefit some flower-generalist
   butterflies by providing extra resources, flower-specialist butterflies
   could further increase dependence on few native flower sources. Such
   butterflies may require intervention in terms of landscape management of
   their preferred flower resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Mangrove forests of Mexico have been threatened by the effects of
   anthropogenic activities during the last decades, mostly related to
   aquaculture, agriculture, livestock and urban development. Genetic
   diversity and fine-scale genetic structure of two generations of the
   black mangrove Avicennia germinans (L.) Stearn were investigated in
   perturbed and preserved sites from three lagoon systems in Sinaloa,
   Mexico. Genetic diversity and overall genetic structure were similar
   between perturbed and preserved sites. However, lower levels of
   fine-scale spatial genetic structure were observed in two of the younger
   (sapling) generations. We attribute this to differences in local
   dynamics of each lagoon system, their status of conservation and levels
   of fragmentation. Also, low connectivity and the effects of disturbance
   could restrict the movement of pollinators and seed dispersal
   capabilities, resulting in low levels of genetic diversity and signs of
   inbreeding. Perturbed populations of A. germinans may play an important
   role in in situ conservation of this complex ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Private yards comprise a significant component of urban lands, with
   managed lawns representing the dominant land cover. Lawns blanket >
   163,000 km(2) of the United States, and 50\% of urban and suburban
   areas. When not treated with herbicides, lawns have the capacity to
   support a diversity of spontaneous (e.g., not planted) flowers, with the
   potential to provide nectar and pollen resources for pollinators such as
   native bees. In order to determine the extent to which suburban lawns
   support these important species, we surveyed lawns in 17 suburban yards
   in Springfield, MA, between May and September 2013 and 2014.
   Householders participating in the study did not apply chemical
   pesticides or herbicides to lawns for the duration of the study. We
   collected 5,331 individual bees, representing 111 species, and 29\% of
   bee species reported for the state. The majority of species were native
   to North America (94.6\%), nested in soil (73\%), and solitary (48.6\%).
   Species richness was lower for oligolectic (specialists on a single
   plant; 9.9\%) and parasitic species (12.6\%). Abundance percentages for
   number of individuals were similar. We documented 63 plant species in
   the lawns, the majority of which were not intentionally planted. The
   most abundant lawn flowers were dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and
   clover (Trifolium sp.). Nearly 30\% of the spontaneous plant species
   growing in the lawns were native to North America. Our study suggests
   that the spontaneous lawn flowers could be viewed as supplemental floral
   resources and support pollinators, thereby enhancing the value of urban
   green spaces.}},

Title = {{The impact of land use/land cover scale on modelling urban ecosystem
   services}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1509-1522}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Context Urbanisation places increasing stress on ecosystem services;
   however existing methods and data for testing relationships between
   service delivery and urban landscapes remain imprecise and uncertain.
   Unknown impacts of scale are among several factors that complicate
   research. This study models ecosystem services in the urban area
   comprising the towns of Milton Keynes, Bedford and Luton which together
   represent a wide range of the urban forms present in the UK.
   Objectives The objectives of this study were to test (1) the sensitivity
   of ecosystem service model outputs to the spatial resolution of input
   data, and (2) whether any resultant scale dependency is constant across
   different ecosystem services and model approaches (e.g. stock-versus
   flow-based).
   Methods Carbon storage, sediment erosion, and pollination were modelled
   with the InVEST framework using input data representative of common
   coarse (25 m) and fine (5 m) spatial resolutions.
   Results Fine scale analysis generated higher estimates of total carbon
   storage (9.32 vs. 7.17 kg m(-2)) and much lower potential sediment
   erosion estimates (6.4 vs. 18.1 Mg km(-2) year(-1)) than analyses
   conducted at coarser resolutions; however coarse-scale analysis
   estimated more abundant pollination service provision.
   Conclusions Scale sensitivities depend on the type of service being
   modelled; stock estimates (e.g. carbon storage) are most sensitive to
   aggregation across scales, dynamic flow models (e.g. sediment erosion)
   are most sensitive to spatial resolution, and ecological process models
   involving both stocks and dynamics (e.g. pollination) are sensitive to
   both. Care must be taken to select model data appropriate to the scale
   of inquiry.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization affects the availability and diversity of floral resources
   (pollen and/or nectar) for wild pollinating insects. For example, urban
   green areas are characterized by an abundance of ornamental plant
   species. Increasingly, trees are planted to improve the aesthetics of
   urban streets and parks. These urban trees might offer important floral
   resources to pollinating insects. To examine the suitability of urban
   trees as resources for pollinating insects, we investigated the chemical
   composition of pollen and nectar as well as the amount of nectar
   produced by the nine major insect-pollinated tree species planted in
   cities of Western Europe, namely Acer pseudoplatanus, Aesculus carnea,
   A. hippocastanum, Robinia pseudoacacia, Tilia cordata, T. x euchlora, T.
   x europaea, T. platyphyllos and T. tomentosa. The analyses revealed that
   globally the Tilia trees provide pollen with lower contents of
   polypeptides, amino acids and phytosterols compared with the other
   species. Urban tree flowers offer abundant nectar with relatively high
   sugar contents (0.16-1.28 mg/flower); sucrose was the predominant sugar
   in all nectars. The investigated tree species could therefore be
   considered in future city plantings.}},

Abstract = {{Homozygous genotypes have great potential in breeding and genomic
   researches in higher plants. Induction of parthenogenesis via
   pollination with gamma-irradiated pollens is an efficient method to
   obtain haploid plants that can overcome the biological limitations of
   fruit trees. In this study, we investigated the induction of haploid
   plants in `Hirado Buntan' pummlo (Citrus grandis) through in-situ
   gynogenesis by pollination with irradiated pollens of trifoliate orange
   (255,325 and 500 Gy) and `Tongshui 72-1 Jincheng' sweet orange (255, 395
   and 500 Gy). The pollen stainability, pollen tube behavior after
   pollination were evaluated. The seeds extracted from the fruits were
   rescued by in vitro embryo culture, and the ploidy level of the obtained
   plantlets was determined by flow cytometry. It showed that two haploid
   plants and one triploid plant, were obtained from the cross-pollination
   of `Hirado Buntan' pummelo with irradiated pollens of trifoliate orange;
   two haploid plants were obtained from the cross-pollination of `Hirado
   Bun tan' pummlo with irradiated pollens of `Tongshui 72-1 Jincheng'
   sweet orange. The parthenogenic origin of the haploid plants was further
   confirmed by chromosomal cytogenetic and SSR analysis. The `Hirado
   Buntan' haploid plants obtained here hold great potential in citrus
   genetic and genomic studies in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Self-incompatibility (SI) prevents inbreeding depression in angiosperms.
   Camellia sinensis is an important cash crop, but breeding improvements
   and genetic studies of the plant are hindered by SI. However, the SI
   mechanism in C. sinensis remains unclear. In this study, a putative
   S-RNase gene (KU852488) was cloned from C. sinensis. The full-length
   cDNA of CsS-RNase is 1121 bp, which encodes 238 amino acids. It shares
   the closest relationship with an S-RNase gene (ADA67883.1), which was
   cloned from a self incompatibility Citrus reticulata cultivar
   `Wuzishatangju'. The expression level of CsS-RNase in the styles were
   3-259 ('Fuding Dabaicha') and 5.6-119 ('Zhongcha108') times higher than
   the other tissues, for example petals, pollen grains, filaments and
   buds. And its expression rose in self-pollinated styles with 24h earlier
   than cross-pollinated styles. The genotypes of CsS-RNase in 10 cultivars
   and one breeding line of C. sinensis were analyzed. Totally, 11
   polymorphic amino acid residues were identified. A single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) marker of CsS-RNase was developed. Finally, the
   CsS-RNase was mapped onto a reference genetic linkage map of tea plant.

Abstract = {{Ten growth or wood-quality traits were assessed in three nearby Corymbia
   citriodora subsp. variegata (CCV) open-pollinated
   family-within-provenance trials (18 provenances represented by a total
   of 374 families) to provide information for the development of a
   breeding program targeting both pulp and solid-wood products. Growth
   traits (diameter at breast high over bark {[}DBH], height and conical
   volume) were assessed at 3 and 7 years of age. Wood-quality traits
   (density {[}DEN], Kraft pulp yield {[}KPY], modulus of elasticity
   {[}MoE] and microfibril angle {[}MfA]) were predicted using
   near-infrared spectroscopy on wood samples collected from these trials
   when aged between 10 and 12 years. The high average KPY, DEN and MoE,
   and low average MfA observed indicates CCV is very suitable for both
   pulp and timber products. All traits were under moderate to strong
   genetic control. In across- trials analyses, high (>0.4) heritability
   estimates were observed for height, DEN, MoE and MfA, while moderate
   heritability estimates (0.24 to 0.34) were observed for DBH, volume and
   KPY. Most traits showed very low levels of genotype x site interaction.
   Estimated age-age genetic correlations for growth traits were strong at
   both the family (0.97) and provenance (0.99) levels. Relationships among
   traits (additive genetic correlation estimates) were favourable, with
   strong and positive estimates between growth traits (0.84 to 0.98),
   moderate and positive values between growth and wood-quality traits
   (0.32 to 0.68), moderate and positive between KPY and MoE (0.64), and
   high and positive between DEN and MoE (0.82). However, negative (but
   favourable) correlations were detected between MfA and all other
   evaluated traits (-0.31 to -0.96). The genetic correlation between the
   same trait expressed on two different sites, at family level, ranged
   from 0.24 to 0.42 for growth traits, and from 0.29 to 0.53 for wood
   traits. Therefore simultaneous genetic improvement of growth and wood
   property traits in CCV for the target environment in south-east
   Queensland should be possible, given the moderate to high estimates of
   heritability and favourable correlations amongst all traits studied,
   unless genotype x site interactions are greater than was evident.}},

   display size and habitat fragmentation}},

Abstract = {{Large floral displays favour pollinator attraction and the import and
   export of pollen. However, large floral displays also have negative
   effects, such as increased geitonogamy, pollen discounting and
   nectar/pollen robber attraction. The size of the floral display can be
   measured at different scales (e.g. the flower, inflorescence or entire
   plant) and variations in one of these scales may affect the behaviour of
   flower visitors in different ways. Moreover, the fragmentation of
   natural forests may affect flower visitation rates and flower visitor
   behaviour. In the present study, video recordings of the inflorescences
   of a tree species (Tabebuia aurea) from the tropical savannah of central
   Brazil were used to examine the effect of floral display size at the
   inflorescence and tree scales on the visitation rate of pollinators and
   nectar robbers to the inflorescence, the number of flowers approached
   per visit, the number of visits per flower of potential pollinators and
   nectar robbers, and the interaction of these variables with the degree
   of landscape disturbance. Nectar production was quantified with respect
   to flower age. Although large bees are responsible for most of the
   pollination, a great diversity of flower insects visit the
   inflorescences of T.aurea. Other bee and hummingbird species are highly
   active nectar robbers. Increases in inflorescence size increase the
   visitation rate of pollinators to inflorescences, whereas increases in
   the number of inflorescences on the tree decrease visitation rates to
   inflorescences and flowers. This effect has been strongly correlated
   with urban environments in which trees with the largest floral displays
   are observed. Pollinating bees (and nectar robbers) visit few flowers
   per inflorescence and concentrate visits to a fraction of available
   flowers, generating an overdispersed distribution of the number of
   visits per inflorescence and per flower. This behaviour reflects
   preferential visits to young flowers (including flower buds) with a
   greater nectar supply.}},

Abstract = {{In many European cities, urban gardens are seen as increasingly
   important components of urban green space networks. We adopt an
   ecosystem services framework to assess contributions of urban gardens to
   the quality of of their users. First, we identify and characterize
   ecosystem services provided by urban gardens. Secondly, we assess the
   demographic and socioeconomic profile of its beneficiaries and the
   relative importance they attribute to different ecosystem services. Next
   we discuss the relevance of our results in relation to critical policy
   challenges, such as the promotion of societal cohesion and healthy
   lifestyles. Data were collected through 44 semi-structured interviews
   and a survey among 201 users of 27 urban gardens in Barcelona, Spain, as
   well as from consultation meetings with local planners. We identified 20
   ecosystem services, ranging from food production over pollination to
   social cohesion and environmental learning. Among them, cultural
   ecosystem services (non-material benefits people derive from their
   interaction with nature) stand out as the most widely perceived and as
   the most highly valued. The main beneficiaries of ecosystem services
   from urban gardens are elder, low-middle income, and migrant people. Our
   results about the societal importance of urban gardens were deemed
   highly relevant by the interviewed green space planners in Barcelona,
   who noted that our data can provide basis to support or expand existing
   gardening programs in the city. Our research further suggests that
   ecosystem services from urban gardens can play an important role in
   addressing several urban policy challenges in cities, such as promoting
   stewardship of urban ecosystems, providing opportunities for recreation
   and healthy lifestyles, and promoting social cohesion. We conclude that
   urban gardens and associated ecosystem services can play an important in
   urban policies aimed at enhancing quality of life in cities,
   particularly if access to their benefits is expanded to larger segments

Abstract = {{`Afourer' mandarin is the first patented citrus cultivar introduced to
   Uruguay. Besides its excellent organoleptic characteristics, the ability
   to produce seedless fruit in the absence of cross-pollination is one of
   its main attributes. In Uruguay, bee-proof nets covering trees result in
   reduction of seed presence, but in some cases fruit set and yield are
   significantly reduced. With the objective of increasing tree
   productivity while avoiding bee's pollination, treatments of gibberellic
   acid (GA(3) 50 mg L-1) at full bloom, trunk girdling 30 days after full
   bloom, and their combination, were applied in two orchards located in
   San Jose (Uruguay, 35 degrees SL). GA(3) application combined with
   girdling consistently increased fruit number and yield per tree, while
   the individual treatments had varying responses. In the experiments, 95
   \% and 96 \% of the fruit were seedless; fruit juice content, and juice
   total soluble solids and acidity were not modified by the treatments.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive behavior of M9 and B30, two new hybrids of mandarin
   ('Ellendale' tangor x Satsuma `Owari') developed at the Uruguayan Citrus
   Breeding Program, was studied during two annual cycles.
   Self-incompatibility of both cultivars was demonstrated, both in natural
   self-pollination and in directed pollination. In both hybrids, low in
   vitro pollen germination ability was found. In M9, since 3rd day after
   anthesis, an in vivo ovule viability loss was evident. At open
   pollination, 80 \% of M9 fruit was seedless, while in B30 the percentage
   scarcely reached 16 \%. After pollinated with `Afourer' mandarin,
   `Valencia' orange and `Lisbon' lemon, M9 had only 33 \% of seedy fruit
   when `Afourer' was the pollinator. On the contrary, B30 presented 100 \%
   of seedy fruit after being pollinated with `Afourer' and `Valencia'.
   Reproductive differences between both hybrids are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Despite its self-pollinating characteristics, Korean ginseng
   germplasm is mainly maintained in clonal gene banks as there is no
   defined approach to the long-term conservation of its seed, including
   the most appropriate stage of embryo development for storage. OBJECTIVE:
   The aim of this study was to reveal the effect of embryo development on
   desiccation tolerance and cryopreservation success in ginseng seeds.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seeds of Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A.
   Meyer) at three post-harvest stages (immediately after harvesting and
   following treatments to enable internal growth of the embryo) were
   desiccated and cryopreserved. RESULTS: The hydration window for the
   >80\% dehiscence and germination of cryopreserved ginseng seeds varied
   with embryo developmental stage: 3-9\% moisture content (MC) for both
   unpulped and undehisced seeds when the embryo was 0.1 the length of the
   endosperm, 7-10\% MC for dehisced seeds (0.5 embryo:endosperm) and
   9-11\% MC for seeds with fully developed embryos (0.9 embryo:endosperm).
   Whilst dried (4-8\% moisture content) and undehisced seeds within fruits
   (unpulped seeds) lost more than half their viability during 1 year's
   storage at room temperature, cryopreservation enabled germination levels
   of c. 90\%. Overall, 432 accessions of Korean ginseng landraces have
   been cryopreserved using undehisced seeds with or without fruits.
   CONCLUSION: Post-harvest treatment of Korean ginseng seeds to enable
   embryo development decreases tolerance of very low MCs, and thus narrows
   the hydration window for cryopreservation. Fresh-harvested and unpulped
   seeds that have been dried to c. 5\% MC are recommended for long-term
   cryogenic storage.}},

Abstract = {{Animal-mediated pollination is required for the reproduction of the
   majority of angiosperms, and pollinators are therefore essential for
   ecosystem functioning and the economy. Two major threats to insect
   pollinators are anthropogenic land-use change and the spread of
   pathogens, whose effects may interact to impact pollination. Here, we
   investigated the relative effects on the ecosystem service of
   pollination of (i) land-use change brought on by agriculture and
   urbanization as well as (ii) the prevalence of pollinator parasites,
   using experimental insect pollinator-dependent plant species in natural
   pollinator communities. We found that pollinator habitat (i.e.
   availability of nesting resources for ground-nesting bees and local
   flower richness) was strongly related to flower visitation rates at the
   local scale and indirectly influenced plant pollination success. At the
   landscape scale, pollination was positively related to urbanization,
   both directly and indirectly via elevated visitation rates. Bumblebees
   were the most abundant pollinator group visiting experimental flowers.
   Prevalence of trypanosomatids, such as the common bumblebee parasite
   Crithidia bombi, was higher in urban compared with agricultural areas, a
   relationship which was mediated through higher Bombus abundance. Yet, we
   did not find any top-down, negative effects of bumblebee parasitism on
   pollination. We conclude that urban areas can be places of high
   transmission of both pollen and pathogens.}},

   Urban Flower Meadows}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{Planted meadows are increasingly used to improve the biodiversity and
   aesthetic amenity value of urban areas. Although many
   `pollinator-friendly' seed mixes are available, the floral resources
   these provide to flower-visiting insects, and how these change through
   time, are largely unknown. Such data are necessary to compare the
   resources provided by alternative meadow seed mixes to each other and to
   other flowering habitats. We used quantitative surveys of over 2 million
   flowers to estimate the nectar and pollen resources offered by two
   exemplar commercial seed mixes (one annual, one perennial) and
   associated weeds grown as 300m(2) meadows across four UK cities, sampled
   at six time points between May and September 2013. Nectar sugar and
   pollen rewards per flower varied widely across 65 species surveyed, with
   native British weed species (including dandelion, Taraxacum agg.)
   contributing the top five nectar producers and two of the top ten pollen
   producers. Seed mix species yielding the highest rewards per flower
   included Leontodon hispidus, Centaurea cyanus and C. nigra for nectar,
   and Papaver rhoeas, Eschscholzia californica and Malva moschata for
   pollen. Perennial meadows produced up to 20x more nectar and up to 6x
   more pollen than annual meadows, which in turn produced far more than
   amenity grassland controls. Perennial meadows produced resources earlier
   in the year than annual meadows, but both seed mixes delivered very low
   resource levels early in the year and these were provided almost
   entirely by native weeds. Pollen volume per flower is well predicted
   statistically by floral morphology, and nectar sugar mass and pollen
   volume per unit area are correlated with flower counts, raising the
   possibility that resource levels can be estimated for species or
   habitats where they cannot be measured directly. Our approach does not
   incorporate resource quality information ( for example, pollen protein
   or essential amino acid content), but can easily do so when suitable
   data exist. Our approach should inform the design of new seed mixes to
   ensure continuity in floral resource availability throughout the year,
   and to identify suitable species to fill resource gaps in established
   mixes.}},

Abstract = {{Watermelon is an annual vegetable crop that suffers from various
   diseases during growth. Genetic engineering is an effective tool for
   improving plant disease resistance. This paper presents an effective
   transformation protocol designed for a female parent watermelon line
   mediated by Agrobacterium. In this protocol, 2 times MS Fe-EDTA were
   supplemented into Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium to suppress the
   chlorosis during watermelon explants culturing, and the optimal
   preculture time (5 days) and coculture time (5 days) were screened out
   to improve the frequency of shoots regeneration. Using our protocol, 17
   putative transgenic plants expressing artificial microRNAs that target
   Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) 2a/2b genes were recovered, and seven of
   them were succeeded in obtaining T1 generation seeds because of the
   technique difficulties of self-pollination of the transgenic watermelon
   lines. PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed that the transferred
   fragment was successfully imported and integrated into the genome of
   three of these seven transgenic lines. DAS-ELISA assay indicated that
   the CMV can be detected in the nontransgenic line but not in the
   transgenic lines, and the transgenic lines displayed resistance to CMV
   infection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   garden study sites at 2 km scales. We classified bees according to
   nesting type (i.e., cavity, ground) and body size and determined which
   local and landscape characteristics correlate with bee community
   characteristics. We found 55 bee species. One landscape and several
   local factors correlated with differences in bee abundance and richness
   for all bees, cavity-nesting bees, ground-nesting bees, and different
   sized bees. Generally, bees were more abundant and species rich in
   bigger gardens, in gardens with higher floral abundance, less mulch
   cover, more bare ground, and with more grass. Medium bees were less
   abundant in sites surrounded by more medium intensity developed land
   within 2 km. The fact that local factors were generally more important
   drivers of bee abundance and richness indicates a potential for
   gardeners to promote bee conservation by altering local management
   practices. In particular, increasing floral abundance, decreasing use of
   mulch, and providing bare ground may promote bees in urban gardens.}},

Title = {{Predicting plant attractiveness to pollinators with passive
   crowdsourcing}},
Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Global concern regarding pollinator decline has intensified interest in
   enhancing pollinator resources in managed landscapes. These efforts
   frequently emphasize restoration or planting of flowering plants to
   provide pollen and nectar resources that are highly attractive to the
   desired pollinators. However, determining exactly which plant species
   should be used to enhance a landscape is difficult. Empirical screening
   of plants for such purposes is logistically daunting, but could be
   streamlined by crowdsourcing data to create lists of plants most
   probable to attract the desired pollinator taxa. People frequently
   photograph plants in bloom and the Internet has become a vast repository
   of such images. A proportion of these images also capture floral
   visitation by arthropods. Here, we test the hypothesis that the
   abundance of floral images containing identifiable pollinator and other
   beneficial insects is positively associated with the observed
   attractiveness of the same species in controlled field trials from
   previously published studies. We used Google Image searches to determine
   the correlation of pollinator visitation captured by photographs on the
   Internet relative to the attractiveness of the same species in
   common-garden field trials for 43 plant species. From the first 30
   photographs, which successfully identified the plant, we recorded the
   number of Apis (managed honeybees), non-Apis (exclusively wild bees) and
   the number of bee-mimicking syrphid flies. We used these observations
   from search hits as well as bloom period (BP) as predictor variables in
   Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for field-observed abundances of each
   of these groups. We found that non-Apis bees observed in controlled
   field trials were positively associated with observations of these taxa
   in Google Image searches (pseudo-R-2 of 0.668). Syrphid fly observations
   in the field were also associated with the frequency they were observed
   in images, but this relationship was weak. Apis bee observations were
   not associated with Internet images, but were slightly associated with
   BP. Our results suggest that passively crowdsourced image data can
   potentially be a useful screening tool to identify candidate plants for
   pollinator habitat restoration efforts directed at wild bee
   conservation. Increasing our understanding of the attractiveness of a
   greater diversity of plants increases the potential for more rapid and
   efficient research in creating pollinator-supportive landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Inducement to stamen movement by oligolectic bees has been reported for
   some Loasaceae species; however, detailed research studies on the
   pollination ecology of species in the genus Aosa are absent. In this
   study, we analyzed the floral biology and breeding system of Aosa
   rupestris (Hook.) Weigend, focusing on the role of pollinators in
   inducing stamens' movements. We described the anthesis, the behavior of
   floral visitors, and carried out reproductive experiments in a
   population in a dry forest ({''}caatinga'') area in Northeastern Brazil.
   Wecarried out four experiments and one control to establish whether the
   interval between the movements of two successive stamens is regulated by
   pollinator visits. Anthesis lasted for 3-4 days. Stamens (102 +/- 12.57)
   remained with closed anther inside petals early in the anthesis, after
   which they moved to the center of the flower and presented its pollen
   (male phase). After all stamens have reached the center of the flower,
   the female phase started. Bicolletes nordestina Urban, 2006 was the only
   floral visitor to A. rupestris flowers, drinking nectar, collecting
   pollen, or sleeping on the flowers. Aosa rupestris was autogamous, but
   fruit set was higher under natural conditions. The interval between
   movements of two successive stamens was not different among experiments.
   Therefore, stamen movements were spontaneous and did not respond to
   pollinator visits, in contrast to the pattern of stamen movements
   observed in other Loasaceae species. Although A. rupestris is
   autogamous, floral structure and behavior of the oligolectic bee
   pollinator ensured the highest level of fruit set in this species.}},

Title = {{Beekeepers' knowledges and participation in pollinator conservation
   policy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{88-98}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers the potential for beekeepers' knowledges to be
   incorporated into participatory policy processes addressing current
   challenges to pollinator health. Pollinator decline is a serious issue
   for future food security and wider environmental resilience, with
   important implications for rural land use governance. The precipitous
   decline in global pollinator populations over recent years has resulted
   in a range of government initiatives to tackle the causes identified. In
   the UK this includes a National Pollinator Strategy in England and
   Pollinator Action Plan in Wales. These plans are notable for their
   introduction of a more participatory approach, incorporating
   lay-knowledge' and citizen science from beekeeping practitioners
   alongside scientific data. This paper presents evidence from interviews
   and participant observation with key stakeholders within the beekeeping
   community in the UK, alongside archival material from the Bee Farmers'
   Association, to assess the knowledge controversies arising from this
   strategy. Specifically, the paper considers the distinction of
   beekeepers' knowledges from typically acknowledged expert sources,
   whilst also reflecting upon aspects of plurality and tension within the
   beekeeping community. The paper concludes by outlining some areas of
   contestation between beekeepers and the wider policy and scientific
   community, which could impact on the future success of more
   participatory forums. This includes, firstly, evidence of hierarchies
   and exclusions in the forms of knowledge considered, when insights from
   professional scientists are privileged above those from beekeepers and
   when some beekeepers knowledges are given more credit than others.
   Secondly, we consider limitations resulting from policy makers' evidence
   requirements for peer-reviewed science, which can further exacerbate the
   exclusion of beekeepers' insights and lead to scenarios whereby policy
   only engages with a narrow set of criteria that may not be beneficial
   when advanced in isolation from the broader system changes. Finally,
   aspects of policy clash are outlined between pollinator conservation and
   wider agricultural strategies that seek to maintain a productivist
   agenda. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   fruit set in parthenocarpic Citrus species}},
Journal = {{PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{247}},
Pages = {{13-24}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Citrus is a wide genus in which most of the cultivated species and
   cultivars are natural parthenocarpic mutants or hybrids (i.e. orange,
   mandarin, tangerine, grapefruit). The autonomous increase in GA(1) ovary
   concentration during anthesis was suggested as being the stimulus
   responsible for parthenocarpy in Citrus regardless of the species. To
   determine the exact GA-role in parthenocarpic fruit set, the following
   hypothesis was tested: GA triggers and maintains cell division in ovary
   walls causing fruit set. Obligate and facultative parthenocarpic Citrus
   species were used as a model system because obligate parthenocarpic
   Citrus sp (i.e. Citrus unshiu) have higher GA levels and better natural
   parthenocarpic fruit set compared to other facultative parthenocarpic
   Citrus (i.e. Citrus clementina).
   The autonomous activation of GA synthesis in C. unshiu ovary preceded
   cell division and CYCA1.1 up regulation (a G2-stage cell cycle
   regulator) at anthesis setting a high proportion of fruits, whereas C.
   clementina lacked this GA-biosynthesis and CYCA1.1 up-regulation failing
   in fruit set. In situ hybridization experiments revealed a
   tissue-specific expression of GA20ox2 only in the dividing tissues of
   the pericarp. Furthermore, CYCA1.1 expression correlated endogenous
   GA(1) content with GA(3) treatment, which stimulated cell division and
   ovary growth, mostly in C clementina. Instead, paclobutrazol (GA
   biosynthesis inhibitor) negated cell division and reduced fruit set.
   Results suggest that in parthenocarpic citrus the specific GA synthesis
   in the ovary walls at anthesis triggers cell division and, thus, the
   necessary ovary growth rate to set fruit. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

   All five species recorded by historical workers prior to 1930 and
   another collected in 1961 were recorded during 2012-2014 along with 10
   Megachile species newly detected in Singapore. Three of the most common
   species in recent surveys of urban Singapore, the resin bees Megachile
   (Callomegachile) umbripennis and M. (C.) disjuncta, and the leaf-cutter
   bee M. (Eutricharaea) sp. 1 were first detected in the country in 1974,
   2010, and 1986 respectively suggesting that these they may be adventive
   from elsewhere in Asia rather than truly native. The following 11
   Megachile are newly recorded for Singapore or were first recorded in
   2013 under a different name in a study of flower-visiting insects:
   Megachile (Aethomegachile) borneana, M. (A.) nr. borneana, M. (A.) sp.

Abstract = {{The composition of fatty acids and phytosterols of oils recovered from
   the seeds of nine industrial fruit by-products: watermelon (Citrullus
   lanatus), honeydew melon (Cucumis melo), sea buckthorn (Hippophae
   rhamnoides), red currant (Ribes rubrum), pomegranate (Punica granatum),
   Japanese quince (Chaenomeles japonica), grape (Vitis vinifera),
   gooseberry (Ribes uva-crispa) and apple (Malus domestica) were studied.
   The oil yield in the investigated fruit seeds ranged from 11.8\% (sea
   buckthorn) to 28.5\% (watermelon). The main phytosterol identified in
   all fruit seed oils was beta-sitosterol with the concentration ranging
   between 0.5 and 3.1 mg/g of oil, in watermelon and Japanese quince,
   respectively. The fatty acid composition was unique for each fruit seed
   oil. The majority of samples had high linoleic acid content
   (38.0-70.7\%), whereas the pomegranate seed oil was extremely rich in
   punicic acid (86.2\%). Japanese quince seed oil had the highest
   potential value for biodiesel production; while the unique profile of
   bioactive compounds recorded in pomegranate seed oil indicated great
   potential for utilization in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical industries.
   The Sigma PUFA/(Sigma SFA + Sigma MUFA) ratio of nine fruit seed oils
   highly correlated (r > 0.9, p < 0.0001) with all biodiesel properties,
   with the exception of the cold filter plugging point. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Ecological effects of artificial light at night on wild plants}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{611-620}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Plants use light as a source of both energy and information. Plant
   physiological responses to light, and interactions between plants and
   animals (such as herbivory and pollination), have evolved under a more
   or less stable regime of 24-h cycles of light and darkness, and, outside
   of the tropics, seasonal variation in day length.
   2. The rapid spread of outdoor electric lighting across the globe over
   the past century has caused an unprecedented disruption to these natural
   light cycles. Artificial light is widespread in the environment, varying
   in intensity by several orders of magnitude from faint skyglow reflected
   from distant cities to direct illumination of urban and suburban
   vegetation.
   3. In many cases, artificial light in the night-time environment is
   sufficiently bright to induce a physiological response in plants,
   affecting their phenology, growth form and resource allocation. The
   physiology, behaviour and ecology of herbivores and pollinators are also
   likely to be impacted by artificial light. Thus, understanding the
   ecological consequences of artificial light at night is critical to
   determine the full impact of human activity on ecosystems.
   4. Synthesis. Understanding the impacts of artificial night-time light
   on wild plants and natural vegetation requires linking the knowledge
   gained from over a century of experimental research on the impacts of
   light on plants in the laboratory and glasshouse with knowledge of the
   intensity, spatial distribution, spectral composition and timing of
   light in the night-time environment. To understand fully the extent of
   these impacts requires conceptual models that can (i) characterize the
   highly heterogeneous nature of the night-time light environment at a
   scale relevant to plant physiology; and (ii) scale physiological
   responses to predict impacts at the level of the whole plant,
   population, community and ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely accepted the influence of meteorology to airborne pollen
   distribution, this concern is clearly affected by the issue of climate
   change. In the SW of Iberian Peninsula pollen from Quercus species is
   often the most abundant in the air and their flowering phenology show
   changes in seasonal pollination affected by meteorological parameters.
   This study aims to investigate airborne pollen data of Quercus from a
   city on the SW Iberian Peninsula over a 20 year period and to analyse
   the trends in these data and their relationship with meteorological
   parameters using time series analysis and propose a predictable model to
   forecast their concentration. Aerobiological sampling was conducted from
   1994 to 2013 in Badajoz (SW Spain) using a 7-day Burkard spore trap. The
   main pollen season for Quercus pollen lasted, on average, 59 days,
   ranging from 31 to 80 days, from 28th March to 27th May. The model
   proposed to forecast the airborne pollen concentration is described by
   Eq. (1). This expression is composed of two terms: the first term
   represents the resilience of the pollen concentration trend in the air
   according to the average concentration of the previous 10 days; the
   second term is obtained from considerations of the actual pollen
   concentration value, which is calculated based on the most
   representative climatic variables multiplied by a fitting coefficient.
   In order to obtain the best fit the model was developed in four partial
   time series of 5 years, each of one with a high level of accuracy,
   although a general model was calculated. (C) 2015 Institution of

   function to help plants to respond to a changing environment and improve
   their chances of survival. Constitutive expression of the gene encoding
   a novel cysteine rich peptide TAXIMIN1 (TAX1) resulted in fusion of
   lateral organs and in abnormal fruit morphology. TAX1 signaling
   functions independently from transcription factors known to play a role
   in this process such as LATERAL ORGAN FUSION1 (LOF1). Here, we report
   that the TAX1 promoter is not induced by the LOF1 transcription factor
   and that the TAX1 peptide neither interferes with transcriptional
   activation by LOF1.1 or transcriptional repression by LOF1.2.
   Furthermore, we found that TAX1 overexpressing lines were hypersensitive
   to continuous light, which may be reflected by a decreased accumulation
   of the UV-B protecting compound sinapoyl-malate. Finally, adding the
   antibiotic cefotaxime to the medium surprisingly countered the light
   hypersensitivity phenotype of TAX1 overexpressing seedlings.}},

   long-term urban light pollution}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The globally increasing light pollution is a well-recognized threat to
   ecosystems, with negative effects on human, animal and plant wellbeing.
   The most well-known and widely documented consequence of light pollution
   is the generally fatal attraction of nocturnal insects to artificial
   light sources. However, the evolutionary consequences are unknown. Here
   we report that moth populations from urban areas with high, globally
   relevant levels of light pollution over several decades show a
   significantly reduced flight-to-light behaviour compared with
   populations of the same species from pristine dark-sky habitats. Using a
   common garden setting, we reared moths from 10 different populations
   from early-instar larvae and experimentally compared their
   flight-to-light behaviour under standardized conditions. Moths from
   urban populations had a significant reduction in the flight-to-light
   behaviour compared with pristine populations. The reduced attraction to
   light sources of `city moths' may directly increase these individuals'
   survival and reproduction. We anticipate that it comes with a reduced
   mobility, which negatively affects foraging as well as colonization
   ability. As nocturnal insects are of eminent significance as pollinators
   and the primary food source of many vertebrates, an evolutionary change
   of the flight-to-light behaviour thereby potentially cascades across
   species interaction networks.}},

Pages = {{420-426}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Pollinators require resources throughout the year to maintain healthy
   populations. Along the urban-natural interface, floral resource
   availability may be limited especially when the system experiences
   extreme drought and fire threats. In such areas, succulents, such as
   Aloe spp., are commonly planted to serve as functional drought-tolerant,
   fire-protective landscaping, which can also support pollinator
   populations. However, access to this resource may be restricted by
   competition from other floral foragers, including invasive pests. We
   measured free-foraging honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) visitation rate and
   visitation duration to aloe flowers with and without Argentine ants
   (Linepithema humile (Mayr)) in a drought-stressed environment and found
   that bees actively avoided foraging on the ant-occupied flowers. To
   determine the mechanisms of avoidance, our subsequent experiments
   assessed visitation in the absence of ants and compared aloe flowers
   treated with ant pheromone to unmanipulated flowers lacking ant
   pheromone. Bees approached all flowers equally, but accepted flowers
   without ants at a higher rate than flowers with ants. Visitation
   duration also increased twofold on ant-excluded flowers, which suggests
   that Argentine ants may limit resource acquisition by bees. Honey bees
   similarly avoided flowers with Argentine ant pheromone and
   preferentially visited unmanipulated flowers at threefold higher rate.
   This study demonstrates that honey bees avoid foraging on floral
   resources with invasive Argentine ants and that bees use ant odors to
   avoid ant-occupied flowers. Resource limitation by this invasive pest
   ant may have serious implication for sustaining healthy pollinator
   populations at the urban-natural interface.}},

Abstract = {{Bidens frondosaL. (Asteraceae) is a widespread invasive weed in China.
   By experimental observation and bagging treatment, the reproductive
   biological characteristics of this species, such as phenology of
   flowering, floral syndrome, breeding system and seed germination
   characteristics, were studied to assess the association of these
   reproductive characteristics with invasiveness. Flowers of B.frondosa
   bloom from September to October every year in Ji'an city, Jiangxi
   province. The lifespan of a single capitulum is approximately 4 to 5
   days, with 30 to 60 florets per capitulum. The capitulum diameter,
   anthocaulus length, floret length and width, stamen length and pistil
   length were 6.1, 30.9, 2.2, 0.6, 3.0 and 2.7mm, respectively. The seed
   set percentage of 48.5\% in the treatment of bagging flowers without
   emasculation suggests B.frondosa is self-compatible; meanwhile, the
   percentage of 63.1\% in the treatment of bagging with emasculation and
   manual xenogamy suggests it also is cross-compatible. P/O ratio per
   capitulum of this species was 450.5, which suggests that the breeding
   system of B.frondosa is facultative xenogamous, and it needs pollinators
   to some degree. The main floral visitors were insects of Hymenoptera,
   Diptera and Lepidoptera. The 1000-achenes weight was 1.97g. The achenes
   emerged as a small germination peak from the fourth to fifth day, and
   had a high accumulated germination rate of up to 84.0\% on day 20 after
   sowing. Our experimental findings suggested that the reproductive
   biological characteristics, such as the versatile mating system of self-
   and cross-pollination, high seed production, a special method of achene
   dispersal and germination peak, accompanied by a high accumulated
   germination rate, might contribute to the invasive ability of
   B.frondosa.}},

Abstract = {{Many members of the Orchidaceae offer no rewards to pollinators and
   attract them through deception. One common approach is to mimic the
   specific floral signals of co-flowering species that are rewarding
   (Batesian floral mimicry) to exploit their pollinators. We investigated
   two putative Batesian floral mimics, Disa gladioliflora subsp.
   capricornis and Disa ferruginea, within a single community to determine
   whether their pollinators are able to discriminate them from their
   models. Despite mimics being indistinguishable from models in terms of
   floral colour as perceived by pollinators, strong preference for model
   flowers was observed in both systems. We nevertheless recorded frequent
   pollen transfer in D. gladioliflora subsp. capricornis, suggesting
   pollination still occurs in the face of pollinator discrimination.
   Although the inability of pollinators to discriminate between models and
   mimics is often cited as a requirement for Batesian floral mimicry, we
   suggest that this need not be the case. Pollination by discriminating
   visitors may still lead to fruit set, with the most accurate mimics
   expected to have the highest fitness. Batesian floral mimicry may thus
   be best indicated when mimic fitness is positively correlated with its
   resemblance to model flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use intensification and resulting habitat loss are put forward as
   the main causes of flower visitor decline. However, the impact of
   urbanization, the prime driver of land-use intensification in Europe, is
   poorly studied. In particular, our understanding of whether and how it
   affects the composition and functioning of flower visitor assemblages is
   scant, yet required to cope with increasing urbanization worldwide.
   Here, we use a nation-wide dataset of plant-flower visitor (Coleoptera,
   Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera) interactions sampled by citizen
   scientists following a standardized protocol to assess macroecological
   changes in richness and composition of flower visitor communities with
   urbanization. We measured the community composition by quantifying the
   relative occurrence of generalist and specialist flower visitors based
   on their specialisation on flowering plant families. We show that
   urbanization is associated with reduced flower visitor richness and a
   shift in community composition toward generalist insects, indicating a
   modification of the functional composition of communities. These results
   suggest that urbanization affects not only the richness of flower
   visitor assemblages but may also cause their large-scale functional
   homogenization. Future research should focus on designing measures to
   reconcile urban development with flower visitor conservation.}},

Title = {{Impact of land cover changes and climate on the main airborne pollen
   types in Southern Spain}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{548}},
Pages = {{221-228}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Airborne pollen concentrations strongly correlate with flowering
   intensity of wind-pollinated species growing at and around monitoring
   sites. The pollen spectrum, and the variations in its composition and
   concentrations, is influenced by climatic features and by available
   nutritional resources but it is also determined by land use and its
   changes. The first factor influence is well known on aerobiological
   researches but the impact of land cover changes has been scarcely
   studied until now. This paper reports on a study carried out in Southern
   Spain (Cordoba city) examining airborne pollen trends over a 15-year
   period and it explores the possible links both to changes in land use
   and to climate variations. The Seasonal-Trend Decomposition procedure
   based on Loess (STL) which decomposes long-term data series into smaller
   seasonal component patterns was applied. Trends were compared with
   recorded changes in land use at varying distances from the city in order
   to determine their possible influence on pollen-count variations. The
   influence of climate-related factors was determined by means of
   non-parametric correlation analysis. The STL method proved highly
   effective for extracting trend components from pollen time series,
   because their features vary widely and can change quickly in a short
   term. Results revealed mixed trends depending on the taxa and reflecting
   fluctuations in land cover and/or climate. A significant rising trend in
   Olea pollen counts was observed, attributable both to the increasing
   olive-growing area but also to changes in temperature and rainfall.
   Poaceae pollen concentrations also increased, due largely to an
   expansion of heterogeneous agricultural areas and to an increase in
   pollen season length positively influenced by rainfall and temperature.
   By contrast, the significant declining trend observed for pollen from
   ruderal taxa, such as Amaranthaceae, Rumex, Plantago and Urticaceae, may
   be linked to changes in urban planning strategies with a higher building
   pressure. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Microbial diversity in the floral nectar of Linaria vulgaris along an
   urbanization gradient}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Microbes are common inhabitants of floral nectar and are
   capable of influencing plant-pollinator interactions. All studies so far
   investigated microbial communities in floral nectar in plant populations
   that were located in natural environments, but nothing is known about
   these communities in nectar of plants inhabiting urban environments.
   However, at least some microbes are vectored into floral nectar by
   pollinators, and because urbanization can have a profound impact on
   pollinator communities and plant-pollinator interactions, it can be
   expected that it affects nectar microbes as well. To test this
   hypothesis, we related microbial diversity in floral nectar to the
   degree of urbanization in the late-flowering plant Linaria vulgaris.
   Floral nectar was collected from twenty populations along an
   urbanization gradient and culturable bacteria and yeasts were isolated
   and identified by partially sequencing the genes coding for small and
   large ribosome subunits, respectively.
   Results: A total of seven yeast and 13 bacterial operational taxonomic
   units (OTUs) were found at 3 and 1 \% sequence dissimilarity cut-offs,
   respectively. In agreement with previous studies, Metschnikowia
   reukaufii and M. gruessi were the main yeast constituents of nectar
   yeast communities, whereas Acinetobacter nectaris and Rosenbergiella
   epipactidis were the most frequently found bacterial species. Microbial
   incidence was high and did not change along the investigated
   urbanization gradient. However, microbial communities showed a nested
   subset structure, indicating that species-poor communities were a subset
   of species-rich communities.
   Conclusions: The level of urbanization was putatively identified as an
   important driver of nestedness, suggesting that environmental changes
   related to urbanization may impact microbial communities in floral
   nectar of plants growing in urban environments.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Recently there has been increasing focus on monitoring pollinating
   insects, due to concerns about their declines, and interest in the role
   of volunteers in monitoring pollinators, particularly bumblebees, via
   citizen science.
   Methodology / Principal Findings
   The Big Bumblebee Discovery was a one-year citizen science project run
   by a partnership of EDF Energy, the British Science Association and the
   Centre for Ecology \& Hydrology which sought to assess the influence of
   the landscape at multiple scales on the diversity and abundance of
   bumblebees. Timed counts of bumblebees (Bombus spp.; identified to six
   colour groups) visiting focal plants of lavender (Lavendula spp.) were
   carried out by about 13 000 primary school children (7-11 years old)
   from over 4000 schools across the UK. 3948 reports were received
   totalling 26 868 bumblebees. We found that while the wider landscape
   type had no significant effect on reported bumblebee abundance, the
   local proximity to flowers had a significant effect (fewer bumblebees
   where other flowers were reported to be >5m away from the focal plant).
   However, the rate of mis-identifcation, revealed by photographs uploaded
   by participants and a photo-based quiz, was high.
   Conclusions / Significance
   Our citizen science results support recent research on the importance of
   local flocal resources on pollinator abundance. Timed counts of insects
   visiting a lure plant is potentially an effective approach for
   standardised pollinator monitoring, engaging a large number of
   participants with a simple protocol. However, the relatively high rate
   of mis-identifications (compared to reports from previous pollinator
   citizen science projects) highlights the importance of investing in
   resources to train volunteers. Also, to be a scientifically valid method
   for enquiry, citizen science data needs to be sufficiently high quality,
   so receiving supporting evidence (such as photographs) would allow this
   to be tested and for records to be verified.}},

   for fruit yield (0.23) and high for average bunch weight (0.65), weight
   of the empty bunch (0.70) and rachis length (0 51). The genetic
   correlation between fruit yield and one hundred fruits weight showed a
   low magnitude (0.28) suggesting the possibility of combining these
   characters for selection. Genetic gains in two ways propagation were
   high, but asexual propagation is presented as a more favorable

Abstract = {{Contemporary germplasm conservation studies largely focus on ex situ and
   in situ management of diversity within centers of genetic diversity.
   Transnational migrants who transport and introduce landraces to new
   locations may catalyze a third type of conservation that combines both
   approaches. Resulting populations may support reduced diversity as a
   result of evolutionary forces such as genetic drift, selection, and gene
   flow, yet they may also be more diverse as a result of multiple
   introductions, selective breeding and cross pollination among multiple
   introduced varietals. In this study, we measured the amount and
   structure of maize molecular genetic diversity in samples collected from
   home gardens and community gardens maintained by immigrant farmers in
   Southern California. We used the same markers to measure the genetic
   diversity and structure of commercially available maize varieties and
   compared our data to previously reported genetic diversity statistics of
   Mesoamerican landraces. Our results reveal that transnational dispersal
   creates an opportunity for the maintenance of maize genetic diversity
   beyond its recognized centers of diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Large parts of urban space around the world exist of small-scale plots
   such as domestic gardens. These small-scale urban spaces carry potential
   for enhancing biodiversity, sustainability and ecosystem services in and
   beyond cities. However, domestic gardening and residential garden
   designs are often guided by aesthetics and ease more than by the aim to
   create habitat and biological diversity. Yard-management decisions
   impact socio-ecological systems in various ways, for example through
   irrigation patterns, fertilization or the use of pesticides or through
   the choice for exotic species that may become invasive over time.
   Yard-management decisions can also positively influence the presence of
   pollinators, improve soil quality or even foster small scale `Wildlife
   Habitats' that can function as ecological stepping stones to the wider
   environment. In this paper a pilot assessment is presented of the
   contribution of residential front-yards in Phoenix (Arizona) and
   Maastricht (The Netherlands) to biodiversity, ecosystem services and
   sustainability by applying the BIMBY (Biodiversity in My (Back) Yard)
   framework.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Increasing human land use for agriculture and housing leads to the loss
   of natural habitat and to widespread declines in wild bees. Bee foraging
   dynamics and fitness depend on the availability of resources in the
   surrounding landscape, but how precisely landscape related resource
   differences affect bee foraging patterns remains unclear. To investigate
   how landscape and its interaction with season and weather drive foraging
   and resource intake in social bees, we experimentally compared foraging
   activity, the allocation of foragers to different resources (pollen,
   nectar, and resin) and overall resource intake in the Australian
   stingless bee Tetragonula carbonaria (Apidae, Meliponini). Bee colonies
   were monitored in different seasons over two years. We compared foraging
   patterns and resource intake between the bees' natural habitat (forests)
   and two landscapes differently altered by humans (suburban gardens and
   agricultural macadamia plantations). We found foraging activity as well
   as pollen and nectar forager numbers to be highest in suburban gardens,
   intermediate in forests and low in plantations. Foraging patterns
   further differed between seasons, but seasonal variations strongly
   differed between landscapes. Sugar and pollen intake was low in
   plantations, but contrary with our predictions, it was even higher in
   gardens than in forests. In contrast, resin intake was similar across
   landscapes. Consequently, differences in resource availability between
   natural and altered landscapes strongly affect foraging patterns and
   thus resource intake in social bees. While agricultural monocultures
   largely reduce foraging success, suburban gardens can increase resource
   intake well above rates found in natural habitats of bees, indicating
   that human activities can both decrease and increase the availability of
   resources in a landscape and thus reduce or enhance bee fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization and agricultural intensification of landscapes are
   important drivers of global change, which in turn have direct impacts on
   local ecological communities leading to shifts in species distributions
   and interactions. Here, we illustrate how human-altered landscapes, with
   novel ornamental and crop plant communities, result not only in changes
   to local community diversity of floral-dependent species, but also in
   shifts in seasonal abundance of bee pollinators. Three years of data on
   the spatio-temporal distributions of 91 bee species show that seasonal
   patterns of abundance and species richness in human-altered landscapes
   varied significantly less compared to natural habitats in which floral
   resources are relatively scarce in the dry summer months. These findings
   demonstrate that anthropogenic environmental changes in urban and
   agricultural systems, here mediated through changes in plant resources
   and water inputs, can alter the temporal dynamics of pollinators that
   depend on them. Changes in phenology of interactions can be an
   important, though frequently overlooked, mechanism of global change.}},

Journal = {{INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{97-107}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Recent studies showed that diverse wild bee assemblages are more
   efficient pollinators than honeybees. In urban ecosystems pollination
   services are also important, for example for the reproduction of many
   plant species in parks, for the production of vegetables and fruits in
   home gardens, as well as other animals depending on bee-pollinated
   plants.
   2. This study investigates the effect of `urbanity' on the abundance,
   species richness and community structure of wild bees foraging at city
   trees and quantifies the contribution of wild bees and honeybees to
   successful pollination. Four common city tree species in Berlin,
   Germany, were sampled in three parks defined as ` green spaces' and
   compared with trees in more ` urban areas'.
   3. In total, 57 wild bee species foraged at the observed trees
   representing 19 \% of all known species in Berlin. Wild bee species
   richness showed only small differences between green spaces and urban
   areas even though social species were found more frequently in green
   areas. Wild bees visited flowers more frequently in green areas, whereas
   the numbers of honeybee flower visits were higher in urban areas. Wild
   bee but not honeybee flower visits showed a positive relationship with
   the reproductive success of trees.
   4. The results suggest that wild bees are important pollinators of city
   trees that dominate the pollinator community in green spaces. To support
   wild bee communities green spaces should be preserved and tree species
   with floral reward should be planted and preserved in urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{Managing urban green space as part of an ongoing social-ecological
   transformation poses novel governance issues, particularly in
   post-industrial settings. Urban green spaces operate as small-scale
   nodes in larger networks of ecological reserves that provide and
   maintain key ecosystem services such as pollination, water retention and
   infiltration, and sustainable food production. In an urban mosaic, a
   myriad of social and ecological components factor into aggregating and
   managing land to maintain or increase the flow of ecosystem services
   associated with green spaces. Vacant lots (a form of urban green space)
   are being repurposed for multiple functions, such as habitat for
   biodiversity, including arthropods that provide pollination services to
   other green areas; to capture urban runoff that eases the burden on
   ageing wastewater systems and other civic infrastructure; and to reduce
   urban heat island effects. Because of the uncertainty and complexities
   of managing for ecosystem services in urban settings, we advocate for a
   governance approach that is adaptive and iterative in nature-adaptive
   governance-to address the ever changing social order underlying
   post-industrial cities and offer the rise of land banks as an example of
   governance innovation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a genetic profile of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) in
   three woodlands of the Helsinki region. We genotyped all mature trees
   and samples of seedlings to evaluate patterns of genetic variation and
   gene flow, and evaluate the long-term stability and natural regeneration
   of these stands. Although five microsatellite loci showed no significant
   differences in heterozygosity between generations in most locations,
   significant (p<.05) pairwise differences were observed between mature
   trees and seedlings at Seurasaari, with higher diversity within
   seedlings. Ninety-four percent of the genetic variation occurred within
   sample sites. Background pollination contributed up to 61\% of the
   diversity among seedlings, and thereby plays an important role in
   shaping the genetic variation and structure of future generations.
   Results indicate that pedunculate oak trees in the surveyed parks of
   Helsinki belong to the same population and that the urban environment
   per se does not interfere with gene flow over the distances represented
   here. Based on our findings, a minimal-maintenance program reliant upon
   natural regeneration of oak in the public parks of Helsinki seems
   plausible.}},

Title = {{Gene flow from Corymbia hybrids in northern New South Wales}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{362}},
Pages = {{205-217}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Some of the most productive taxa for forestry are interspecific F-1
   hybrids grown as exotics in the tropics and subtropics. Attributes of
   resilience, adaptability and vigour which engender the hybrids for wood
   production, may also exacerbate the risk they present from gene flow to
   native species gene pools or to local ecologies as weeds. To determine
   the biological and genetic factors that influence the extent of
   hybridisation, we examine the distribution and genealogy of wildlings
   surrounding plantings of locally-exotic Corymbia torelliana (Section
   Cadageria) near native C. henryi (Section Maculatae) in northern New
   South Wales. Our study showed pre-mating and pre- and post-zygotic
   barriers were incomplete, with in situ generation and natural
   establishment of both F-1 hybrids (n = 3) and advanced generation
   hybrids under the disturbed conditions bordering native forest. As
   hybrids were located on alluvial flats exposed to frost, they also
   likely have an extended ecological range relative to native C. henryi.
   Despite the likely generation of large viable seed crops on F-1 trees at
   the site over many years, establishment success and survival of advanced
   generation hybrids may be low, as only 5 immature and no mature advanced
   generation hybrids were identified. Propagation and genetic analysis of
   a seed crop from one F-1 wildling showed early survival and vigour of
   seedlings in cultivation was high, and that at least for some F-1 in
   some seasons, backcrossing to the recurrent native C henryi parent is
   favoured (60\%), whereas selfing (10\%) and crossing with other F-1
   (30\%) was less frequent. Transport of seed by stingless bees probably
   accounted for long distance dispersal from C torelliana, but this
   mechanism does not appear to supplement gravity-dispersal of seed from
   the F-1. Coupled with other evidence from studies of bee behaviour,
   controlled pollination in Corymbia sp., and long-term fitness in second
   generation eucalypt hybrids, we anticipate gene flow via pollen rather
   than seed will be the greater challenge for managing the risk of
   introgression of C. torelliana ancestry into native species from the
   planted F-1 hybrid. If large sources of F-1 pollen become available to
   compete with native pollen, gene flow will probably be frequent and
   hybrids may establish in disturbed conditions and in habitats beyond the
   ecological range of their native parent. Further study is needed to
   determine the degree to which outbreeding depression and poor survival
   inhibits on-going gene flow. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural land use is increasingly changing due to different
   anthropogenic activities. A combination of economic, socio-political,
   and cultural factors exerts a direct impact on agricultural changes.
   This study aims to illustrate how stakeholders and policymakers can take
   advantage of a web-based spatial decision support system (SDSS), namely
   SmartScape (TM) to either test existing crop change policies or produce
   effective crop change decisions using tradeoff analysis. We addressed
   the consequences of two common crop change scenarios for Dane county in
   Wisconsin, United States, (a) replacing perennial energy crops with
   annual energy crops and (b) replacing annual energy crops with perennial
   energy crops. The results suggested that converting areas under grass
   and alfalfa production that were located on high quality soil and flat
   slope to corn promoted a net-income and availability of gross biofuel.
   Additionally, the model outcome proposed that converting areas under
   corn and soy production that were located on high slope to grass
   promoted net-energy, phosphorus loading, soil loss, soil carbon
   sequestration, nitrous oxide emission, grassland bird habitat,
   pollinator abundance, and biocontrol. Therefore, SmartScape (TM) can
   assist strategic crop change policy by comparing the tradeoff among
   ecosystem services to ensure that crop change policies have outcomes
   that are agreeable to a diversity of policymakers. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Mapping technological and biophysical capacities of watersheds to
   regulate floods}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{483-499}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Flood regulation is a widely valued and studied service provided by
   watersheds. Flood regulation benefits people directly by decreasing the
   socio-economic costs of flooding and indirectly by its positive impacts
   on cultural (e.g., fishing) and provisioning (e.g., water supply)
   ecosystem services. Like other regulating ecosystem services (e.g.,
   pollination, water purification), flood regulation is often enhanced or
   replaced by technology, but the relative efficacy of natural versus
   technological features in controlling floods has scarcely been examined.
   In an effort to assess flood regulation capacity for selected urban
   watersheds in the southeastern United States, we: (1) used long-term
   flood records to assess relative influence of technological and
   biophysical indicators on flood magnitude and duration, (2) compared the
   widely used runoff curve number (RCN) approach for assessing the
   biophysical capacity to regulate floods to an alternative approach that
   acknowledges land cover and soil properties separately, and (3) mapped
   technological and biophysical flood regulation capacities based on
   indicator importance-values derived for flood magnitude and duration. We
   found that watersheds with high biophysical (via the alternative
   approach) and technological capacities lengthened the duration and
   lowered the peak of floods. We found the RCN approach yielded results
   opposite that expected, possibly because it confounds soil and land
   cover processes, particularly in urban landscapes, while our alternative
   approach coherently separates these processes. Mapping biophysical (via
   the alternative approach) and technological capacities revealed great
   differences among watersheds. Our study improves on previous mapping of
   flood regulation by (1) incorporating technological capacity, (2)
   providing high spatial resolution (i.e., 10-m pixel) maps of watershed
   capacities, and (3) deriving importance-values for selected landscape
   indicators. By accounting for technology that enhances or replaces
   natural flood regulation, our approach enables watershed managers to
   make more informed choices in their flood-control investments. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Development and ripening processes differ in pollinated and
   parthenocarpic fruit. While the facultative parthenocarpic common-type
   fig fruit serves as a receptacle for flower development, it becomes
   fleshy by either pollination or through a parthenocarpic process. Here
   we studied the effect of pollination on common-type fig fruit
   development and ripening characteristics compared to the parthenocarpic
   fruit under otherwise identical conditions. The effects of pollination
   on fruit development were investigated on the tree and in storage.
   Pollinated fruit showed altered developmental processes. Ripened
   pollinated fruit were round, in contrast to the pear-like shape of the
   parthenocarpic fruit. The pollinated fruit also had a larger diameter
   and weight and improved firmness compared to the parthenocarpic fruit.
   At harvest, the pollinated fruit exhibited more commercially desirable
   physical and taste characteristics, with advanced fertile nutlets
   compared to the sterile undeveloped non-bearing nutlets of the
   parthenocarpic fruit. During storage, senescence and spoilage of the
   pollinated fruit were slower than in parthenocarpic fruit, as manifested
   by firmness, internal texture, weight, size, shriveling, and decay.
   Thus, pollination of the common-type fig cultivar Brown Turkey delayed
   senescence and extended the shelf life of its fruit. The external and
   internal morphological differences throughout post-pollination
   development make common-type fig an excellent research tool for studies
   of physiological and molecular aspects of pollination. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   growing in the Vattakanal shola forest of Palni Hills, Western Ghats,
   India. A study on reproductive biology of the species was conducted in
   the natural habitat to study its phenology, floral biology, pollen
   biology, fruit set and seed germination. Flowers are bisexual, anther
   dehisces 2-3 hours after anthesis and stigma becomes receptive on the
   day of anthesis and extends up to 6 days. Breeding experiments confirmed
   that the species permits autogamy and geitonogamy. Six different
   pollinators were observed during peak flowering period and Apis dorsata
   (honey bee) was found to be an effective pollinator and it takes 55 +/-
   15 sec per flower. Percentage of fruit set observed in the natural
   habitat was 78 and seed germination rate was found to be less than 5 in
   the natural habitat. Tests showed that more than 70\% of seeds lost
   their viability after a year and most of the seeds were infested with
   Fusarium sp., Lasiodiplodia sp. and Penicillium sp. Further, the natural
   habitat of the species is altered by commercial plantations, tourism and
   urbanization in the Palni Hills, which leads to their reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Colombia is a country best known for its biodiversity as it has a great
   variety of ecosystems, therefore a lot of wildlife species. Among the
   groups of animal species, birds are worth noting, as Colombia is one of
   the countries with the highest diversity of these animals. They play
   important roles in ecosystems such as pollination, pest control and
   natural indicators, among others. And among all bird families, there are
   those belonging to the Psittacidae family such as parrots, parakeets and
   macaws, featuring a curved and strong beak, prehensile feet and feathers
   of varying colors. Their area of distribution is mainly America,
   throughout neo-tropical areas. However, many of these species are
   threatened by human activities, as well as excessive city and population
   growth, also by illegal hunting, which has forced these individuals out
   of their habitats, and made them search for shelter, which they have
   found in some urban spaces where they can survive. We intend to take
   care of endangered species from the Psittacidae family at Pascual Bravo
   University.}},

Abstract = {{Number of maternal and infant mortality in Indonesia is high. This
   problem can be minimized by monitoring the fetal condition via
   ultrasound image. In addition, Indonesia have small number of obstetrics
   and gynecology compare to number of its population. Moreover, it is
   centralized in urban areas, so it is hard to monitor the condition of
   every babies in Indonesia. In order to resolve this problem, we have
   built fetal head monitoring system. Part of the system is to segment the
   fetal head in ultrasound image. In this paper, we examine nature
   optimization such as bat algorithm, cuckoo search, and flower
   pollination algorithm for optimizing Gaussian elliptical path for
   automatic fetal head segmentation. Experiment results shows that nature
   optimization Based Gaussian elliptical path (DoGEII-FPA and DoGEII-CS)
   has a minimum error compared to Gaussian elliptical path (DoGEll) which
   is optimized by Nelder-Mead. Interestingly, DoGEll-FPA and DoGEll-CS
   perform well from DoGEll-NM in different image.}},

Abstract = {{The peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) and nectarine (P. persica var.
   nuscipersica Dippel) breeding program of the Agronomic Institute (IAC)
   began in the 1940s with the introduction of varieties from the United
   States. To date, 32 cultivars of peaches and four nectarine cultivars
   have been developed. In this study, we selected parental crosses by
   agronomic traits of fruits of 80 cultivars from the germplasm IAC-PRUNU.
   Therefore, a mixed model was adjusted considering a completely
   randomized design with five replications and six fruits per repetition.
   The evaluated traits were: fruit weight (FW), soluble solids (SS),
   titratable pH and citric acid content (CAC). The surface colour was
   assessed by factors hue and chroma angles. The narrow-sense heritability
   coefficient ranged from 0.01 (CAC-2012) to 0.95 (pH-2013), but, except
   for CAC-2012, all of these was intermediate or high. Based on the
   predicted breeding values, we detected statistically significant
   differences among genotypes for all traits. There was emphasis on
   cultivars `IAC Douradao' and `IAC Ouromel-2' and tree selections (IAC
   2982-24, IAC 280-28 and IAC 280-29) as they showed higher frequencies of
   greater breeding value among cultivars in 2012; however, the cultivars
   with better frequencies were `BRS Fascinio', `Precoce de Itupeva', `IAC
   Tropical-2' and `FLA 81-17N'. We generated 497 seedlings (2012) and 345
   seedlings (2013) from crosses and open pollination, which will be
   evaluated for agronomic traits. Overall, our results show the importance
   for conserving the germplasm IAC-PRUNU once it was possible to identify
   the genetic variability, which contributes to the future direction of
   crossings to obtain new cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{Although irradiation and triploidy can reduce fertility of mandarin
   cultivars, seediness in supposedly seedless cultivars through
   cross-pollinations is still an undesired characteristic. Female
   fertility was assessed (as part of a collaborative study between Spain,
   Morocco and South Africa) to determine whether controlled manual
   cross-pollination could be used as a methodology for distinguishing
   fertility differences between cultivars. Controlled manual
   cross-pollinations were made at anthesis and 6 days after anthesis on
   four female parents ('Nules', `Nadorcott', `Nova' and `Marisol') using
   two male parents ('Nova' and `Nadorcott') during the 2012 and 2013
   citrus flowering seasons. Open-pollinated fruit were included as a
   control. Pollen germination was tested during flowering and the number
   of seed per fruit was determined at harvest. Pollen germination was
   higher in `Nadorcott' compared with `Nova'. The number of seed per fruit
   was higher in controlled manually cross-pollinated flowers compared with
   open-pollinated flowers. The number of seed decreased with later
   pollination dates, probably due to reduced stigma receptivity.
   `Nadorcott' as pollinator resulted in larger numbers of seed in female
   parents in comparison with `Nova' as pollinator, except when pollinated
   with itself. Female fertility is directly related to seediness, and the
   degree of female fertility can be determined with high accuracy by
   controlled manual cross-pollination. This methodology provides a simple
   means to describe cultivar-specific differences in female fertility.}},

Abstract = {{The eucalypts, or gum trees (genera Eucalyptus, Corymbia and Angophora),
   contain unique flora with over 800 species throughout Australia (and its
   closest northern neighbours) and represent one of Australia's greatest
   floral icons. Eucalypts play a vital role in all Australia's ecosystems,
   providing habitats for native birds, insects and animals. Eucalypts
   inhabit a diverse range of habitats, from dry deserts to lush
   rainforests and windswept coastal cliffs. There are a great number of
   species that are rarely seen in cultivation, with highly ornamental
   flowers, leaves, buds, and fruit, and small habits. Researchers at the
   University of Adelaide program have been investigating the development
   of ornamental eucalypts for over 15 years, using controlled pollinations
   to investigate relationships between species and to breed new
   interspecific hybrids. The new hybrids then undergo selection and
   development for suitability in different markets. Clonal propagation is
   a major bottleneck in new cultivar development. Grafting is commonly
   used for some cultivars of flowering gums; however, this program has
   sought to develop tissue culture methods for propagation of selected
   forms, as this will provide significant commercial advantages in the
   future. Additional research has been conducted into aspects of
   reproductive biology of eucalypts, including pollen viability after
   storage and stigma receptivity. This paper will report on the program
   and describe the way forward, with exciting new developments.}},

Abstract = {{Colored sticky traps have been commonly used for the sampling of
   detrimental insect species worldwide. However, there is no information
   about the catches of non-target insects such as predaceous and
   pollinating insects by colored traps. In this study, trials with colored
   sticky traps (white, yellow, blue and green) in mandarin cv Okitsu
   (Satsuma) trees were carried out during 2011 and 2012 in Adana Province,
   Turkey. Colored plates were hung, at about 1.7 m above ground level,
   from the exterior canopy of the selected trees and were positioned to
   the four cardinal directions. A total of 15 beneficial insect species
   were captured on various colored plates. Yellow and green traps were
   more attractive to the coccinellid, Oenopia conglobata (L., 1758), than
   the other colored traps. Significantly more of the predaceous hoverfly,
   Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer, 1776) and the honey bee, Apis mellifera

   measured traits showed significant correlations between some important
   traits. Factor analysis for all genotypes divided traits to six main
   factors that included 79.53\% of total variance and fruit and leaf

   divided genotypes to five main clusters at distance of 15 on dendrogram.
   In the first group most of the open pollinated accessions placed and
   mostly separated of each other based on fruit and shoot characters.
   Citrulus colocynthis accessions with distinct traits revealed more

Abstract = {{The separation events of abscission occur in a group of functionally
   specialized cells known as the abscission zone (AZ). This tissue
   differentiates simultaneously with the development of lateral organs
   formed from the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in a limited number of
   morphological locations on the plant body (primary AZs) or after the
   development of lateral organs in a position that is not predetermined by
   the morphology of the plant (secondary AZs). In addition,
   differentiation and activation of secondary AZs are almost concurrent
   processes whereas primary AZs remain inactive until they acquire the
   competence to respond to abscission signals. Research on abscission has
   been mainly focused on the analysis of primary AZs while secondary AZs
   have drawn limited attention. In citrus pistils, the unit formed by the
   stigma and the style usually abscises several weeks after anthesis.
   Differentiation of the style AZ takes place in the basal portion of the
   style near the ovary. However, style AZ differentiation and activation
   does not occur in certain cultivars of citrus that retain the style
   throughout fruit development and maturation. In order to study style AZ
   differentiation and activation we performed a comparative anatomical and
   molecular analysis in pistils of both `Navelate' orange and `Bergamot of
   Calabria' showing regular stylar abscission and persisting styles,
   respectively. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms
   underlying stylar abscission may be the starting point to envisage
   strategies to prevent fertilization and ensure the production of
   seedless citrus fruits without the need of avoiding pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation, caused by, among all, agriculture and
   urbanization, is one of the most important drivers of plant biodiversity
   decline worldwide. One of the signs of deteriorating zoogamous plant
   reproduction is pollen limitation, often associated with a decline in
   pollinator diversity and abundance. Various authors predict that the
   most vulnerable taxa are outbreeding plant species characterized by
   specialist pollination systems. We have, therefore, focused on
   self-incompatible Corydalis solida, an ancient forest, spring ephemeral
   plant, growing in three remnant urban populations in the city of Warsaw
   (Poland). Over two years, we checked for pollen limitation and recorded
   insect diversity and abundance for C. solida flowers. Our study
   populations composed of self-incompatible individuals were mainly
   visited by generalist pollinators, and produced more seeds when
   supplementally pollinated. Pollen limitation, however, was greater
   during 1 year with an early spring onset, when we observed a decline in
   floral visitors diversity and activity. This was probably an effect of
   phenological mismatch between plants and their pollinators, in this
   case, mostly social bees, i.e., over-wintered bumblebee queens and Apis
   mellifera. We conclude that for outbreeding zoogamous spring ephemerals,
   such as C. solida serviced by generalist pollinators, changing climatic
   conditions may override the effects of habitat fragmentation and
   influence their reproductive success.}},

Journal = {{HORTICULTURE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{Since both artificial pollination and fruit thinning are necessary for
   marketable fruit production of Japanese pears (Pyrus pyrifolia (burm.
   f.) Nakai) in Japan, about a 20\% fruit set is ideal without pollination
   because only 5\% of flowers are actually subjected to fruit production.
   In this study, copper (Cu2+) and ferrous (Fe2+) ions were shown to be
   effective for inducing a nearly-ideal fruit set of the Japanese pear
   `Kosui'. Fruit induced by ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) solution or a Bordeaux
   mixture, which is a combination of copper sulfate (CuSO4), lime, and
   water, were parthenocarpic, because 1) self-pollen tube growth was not
   promoted by Cu2+ and Fe2+, 2) almost no perfect seeds were observed at
   harvest, and 3) Cu2+ and Fe2+ acted as strong inhibitors of pollen tube
   growth in vitro. The effective stage for inducing parthenocarpy was
   sprouting time to 4 days after anthesis in the Bordeaux mixture, and
   sprouting time to 4 days before anthesis in the FeSO4 solution. Annual
   changes in the effectiveness were found in both chemicals, and the
   Bordeaux mixture showed no inhibitory effect on the fruit set of
   cross-pollinated flowers. The growth of Bordeaux mixture-induced fruit
   was improved by gibberellin (GA) paste or GA paste mixed with
   N-(N-(2-chloro-4-pyridy1)-N'-phenylurea (CPPU) treatment of the fruit
   stalk; the treated fruit was about 100 g heavier than the untreated
   fruit. The GA paste treatment is currently conducted to promote fruit
   growth and maturation in `Kosui' fruit production in Japan, and the
   Bordeaux mixture can be substituted for chemical fungicide generally
   used before anthesis to control scab and black spot disease.
   Accordingly, the Bordeaux mixture is a promising chemical for great
   labor-saving in `Kosui' cultivation.}},

Abstract = {{Self-incompatibility (SI) in Citrus strongly prevents self-pollination
   and promotes outcrossing. Even though it has been confirmed that the
   S-allele is a key gene in controlling the recognition between pollen and
   pistil in Rosaceae, Solanaceae and Papaveraceae, this has not been
   cloned in Citrus. A citrus mature pollen culture system was established
   in our lab in order to culture `Banpeiyu' and `Hyuganatsu' pollen in
   vitro. Stylar crude protein extracts were used to treat citrus pollen in
   order to induce the SI-like response in the pollen tube. We observed the
   alteration of the pollen tube shape, including tip twisting and content
   leakage. Programmed cell death (PCD), as a normal cellular process that
   eliminates unwanted cells, was reported in previous studies of
   incompatible pollen tubes, together with an increase in hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2), depolymerization of actin skeleton, the collapse of
   mitochondria, and leakage of cytochrome c. In our study, we investigated
   the cytosolic calcium ion concentration ({[}Ca2+](cyt)) changes and
   identified alterations in the actin cytoskeleton in the pollen tube
   after exposure to the incompatible treatment. The {[}Ca2+](cyt) content
   increased after incompatible treatment, but there was no obvious
   difference between the compatible-treatment group and the control.
   Punctate foci of actin filaments were found in the incompatible-treated
   pollen tubes; the rates of punctate foci were significantly higher than
   in the compatible-treated pollen tubes in both `Banpeiyu' and
   `Hyuganatsu'. The results suggested that these alterations in the pollen
   tubes were directly induced by the SI-like response, and might cause
   pollen tube PCD.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature has a clear effect on pollen germination and pollen tube
   growth. Recently, researchers have reported a relationship between
   self-incompatibility (SI) and temperature. However, the detailed
   behavior and mechanisms of this relationship have not been completely
   clarified in Citrus. In the present study, to reveal the relationship
   between SI and temperature in Citrus cultivars, we investigated pollen
   germination and pollen tube behavior using in vitro pistil and mature
   pollen systems under controlled environmental chamber conditions of 25,
   30 and 35 degrees C. We first evaluated pollen tube growth for one week
   in in vitro detached pistils of the SI cultivar `Hyuganatsu' (Citrus
   tamurana hort. Ex Tanaka) after self-or cross-pollination. `Hassaku' (C.
   hassaku) and `Banpeiyu' pummelo {[}C. maxima (Burm.) Merr.] were used as
   compatible cultivars. Pollen tube growth was observed one week after
   pollination using aniline blue staining and a fluorescent microscope.
   Results indicated incompatible pollen tubes stopped in the upper part of
   styles at 25 degrees C, whereas they reached the base of the styles at
   30 degrees C, similar to the behavior of compatible pollen tubes at 25
   degrees C. To investigate improvement of the SI-like responses of pollen
   tubes under different temperature conditions, we examined the inhibition
   of pollen tube growth and morphological changes of tube tips using the
   mature pollen culture of `Hyuganatsu' (Abe et al., in press). The pollen
   was treated with stylar crude extract protein of `Hyuganatsu' to
   simulate the SI-like response. Pollen tubes with the SI treatment showed
   tip inflation, content leakage and abnormal tip twisting at 25 degrees
   C, and tube growth was inhibited. However, at 30 degrees C, these
   SI-like responses were suppressed. These results suggested that
   temperature might be a trigger for avoiding SI reaction in Citrus.}},

Abstract = {{The peculiarities of the development of the male gametophyte of Pinus
   silvestris L. in the urban environment were studied. Quality of pollen
   was evaluated by laboratory experiments through germination at the
   nutrient medium and by histochemical staining to determine the presence
   of redox enzymes. It was shown that pollen viability is closely linked
   to climatic and weather conditions during the period of
   microsporogenesis and mass pollination. Atmospheric pollution affected
   the pollen significantly. Low temperatures and high humidity in the
   background of the weak capacity of self-purification of the atmosphere
   led to a reduction of the potential pollen viability. The ability of the
   pollen grains to germinate was reduced, the number of abnormal pollen
   tubes was increased, and the proportion of cells containing active
   peroxidase was decreased. We revealed a close positive correlation
   between the frequency of germinated pollen grains and the presence of
   active peroxidase, as well as a negative correlation between the
   percentage of colored pollen and the frequency of pollen tube anomalies,
   which confirmed the role of peroxidase activity not only in the
   induction of pollen germination, but also the formation of pollen tubes.
   A ranking of the urban territory on the strength of unfavorable
   environmental factors has been carried out. The reaction of male
   gametophyte of pine allowed us to consider it as a biological indicator
   of unfavorable ecological situation in the urban environment.}},

Abstract = {{In cities all over the world, growing numbers of women are working or
   studying further away from home than ever before. This article presents
   policies by the World Bank and recommendations by the United Nations to
   improve conditions for women's mobility in cities. Although these stress
   different factors affecting women's experiences of traffic and
   transport, they all agree about the importance of enabling women's
   mobility. However, gender-sensitive policies have been largely
   unsuccessful. This article presents examples of conditions for women in
   New Delhi and other rapidly growing Asian cities that illustrate how
   gender norms operate. This study uses the perspectives of development
   research and gender studies to examine economic and political
   initiatives and the way women act and interact with transport in local
   contexts. It facilitates critical reflection upon existing transport
   policies and suggests `how' women's needs may be effectively addressed.
   More in-depth knowledge about women's needs and the problems they face
   when travelling will be useful for designing of policies that address
   more than simply the harassments of women. More inclusive urban access
   would enhance conditions for women and enable them to make choices
   according to their needs. In this way, social science and policy will
   cross-pollinate one another.}},

   potential of urban green spaces}},
Journal = {{REVISTA DE SALUD AMBIENTAL}},

Pages = {{33-42}},
Abstract = {{Urban parks are green infrastructure elements that should contribute to
   improving the quality of life and well-being of citizens. In this work
   there are presented the results of applying a new index to estimate the
   potential allergenicity of parks located in 20 Spanish cities. This
   index, which considers intrinsic biological and biometric parameters of
   existing plant species in parks, allows the allergenic risk thereof to
   be calculated on a scale ranging from 0 to 1, depending on whether to
   the park's allergenicity is zero or has a high risk for the population.
   The parks selected for this study have different typologies, sizes,
   species richness and biodiversities, which has yielded highly variable
   index values. Almost half of the analysed parks have an index value
   higher than 0.30, a threshold considered having a moderate to high risk,
   and therefore, enough to cause allergy symptoms in the population.
   Conversely, most of the parks had an index value below this threshold,
   so that the risk of suffering allergies is low or very low. The formula
   also allows the species that most contribute to the resulting value for
   allergenicity to be known, which are those having an anemophillous
   strategy of pollination, extended periods of flowering, and a referenced
   high allergenicity. These requirements are met by all species of the
   Betulaceae, Cupressaceae and Moraceae families, and to a lesser extent
   by Oleaceae and Platanaceae. It can be concluded that the development of
   an index to estimate the allergenicity of urban green spaces constitutes
   a useful tool to minimize the impact of pollen allergy on the
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Oil-bearing rose (Rosa damascena Mill.) is one of the most strongly
   scented rose species used in the perfumery and cosmetics industries.
   This research ultimately aimed to reveal the variation in and evaluate
   the breeding potential of plants whose seeds were derived from R.
   damascena, which has only been propagated vegetatively for centuries.
   The seeds extracted from the mature fruits of open-pollinated plants
   were stratified at 4 degrees C for 3 months and sown into vials.
   Seedlings in pots were grown under greenhouse conditions, and a total of
   83 seed-derived plants were finally planted in the experimental field.
   The 3-year-old progenies were examined for floral characteristics and
   scent composition by using HS-SPME combined with GC-MS. A wide variation
   in flower characteristics was identified, e.g., with different petal
   colors from white to red and petal numbers from 5 to 115. Considerable
   variability in floral scent molecules such as phenylethyl alcohol
   (23.26\%-74.54\%), citronellol (5.57\%-31.59\%), and geraniol
   (3.09\%-26.93\%) was recorded among the seed-derived plants. As a
   result, the genetic variations resulting from the segregation of the
   alleles at heterozygous loci were appropriate for the clonal selection
   of novel oil-bearing rose varieties.}},

Abstract = {{The bitter desert watermelon, Citrullus colocynthis (L.) Schrad is a
   wild species valuable for biotic and abiotic stress resistance that

   study was to survey and identify C. colocynthis accessions displaying
   resistance to the Papaya ringspot virus-watermelon strain (PRSV-W).
   Thirty-one accessions of C. colocynthis, collected in Africa, the Middle
   East, southwest Asia, and India were evaluated for PRSV-W resistance. Of
   these 31 accessions, 4 U.S. Plant Introduction (PI) accessions,
   including 525080 (collected in Qena, Egypt) and PI 537277, PI 652554,
   and Griffin 14201 (collected at the northern Indian desert of Rajasthan
   and the neighboring region of Punjab, Pakistan) showed high resistance
   to PRSV-W. Plants of these four resistant PIs were self-pollinated to
   produce S1 and S2 seeds that continued to maintain the high levels of
   PRSV resistance. Since there is a wide genetic distance between
   watermelon cultivars and C. colocynthis, we performed crosses and
   backcrosses with watermelon cultivars, including `Charleston Gray' and
   `Sugar Baby' to produce viable seed that would be useful in the
   development of genetic populations and in introducing the resistance
   into watermelon cultivars.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{297-310}},
Abstract = {{Declining pollinator abundance has become a major global environmental
   concern. Almost 90\% of flowering plants rely on animal pollinators for
   reproduction, and negative effects of pollinator declines on crop
   production have been shown. Urbanization is at least partially
   responsible for pollinator declines, and public programs have been
   developed to encourage pollinator-friendly gardens. Here, in an
   observational study, we investigate the relationship between pollinator
   activity and the proportion of native species in unmanipulated private
   gardens in an urban area. Pollinator activity in each of ten gardens was
   recorded at nine times throughout the growing season. Pollinator
   frequency differed among gardens, and visitation was positively
   associated with percent area planted with native species, after
   correcting for effects of time of year, plant density and total garden
   area. The effect of proportion native plant area on pollinator activity
   differed among pollinator guilds, and was particularly strong for bumble
   bees and large bees. The observation of heightened pollinator activity
   with increasing native area in this correlational study suggests that
   cultivating native plant species should be encouraged in urban gardens.
   We discuss that, although such observational studies have the advantage
   of realism, they cannot determine underlying causal factors driving the
   observed correlation.}},

   human health. Using aerobiological techniques to sample and characterize
   airborne biological particulate matter (BPM), we can identify the main
   species contributing to the pollen spectrum and chart variations in
   counts and overall pollen dynamics throughout the year. However, given
   the exponential increase in the number of pollen allergy sufferers in
   built-up areas, new strategies are required to improve the biological
   quality of urban air. This paper reports on a novel characterization of
   the potential allergenicity of the tree species most commonly used as
   ornamentals in Mediterranean cities. Values were assigned to each
   species based on a number of intrinsic features including pollination
   strategy, pollen season duration, and allergenic capacity as reported in
   the specialist literature. Findings were used to generate a database in
   which groups of conifers, broadleaves, and palm trees were assigned a
   value of between 0 and 36, enabling their allergenicity to be rated as
   nil, low, moderate, high, or very high. The case study presented here
   focuses on the city of Granada in southern Spain. The major
   airborne-pollen-producing species were identified and the allergenicity
   of species growing in urban green zones was estimated. Corrective
   measures are proposed to prevent high allergen levels and thus improve
   biological air quality.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the length cDNA and DNA of Cullin gene were cloned from
   Wuzishatangju (Self-incompatibilty, SI) and Shatangju
   (Self-compatibilty, SC). The results revealed that Cullin genes from
   Wuzishatangju and Shatangju were 1989 bp in ORF sequence and encoded 662
   amino acid while between Wuzishatangju and Shatangju, three bases and
   two three amino acids were different. The expression of the Cullin gene
   in anthers of Wuzishatangju was 7.4-fold higher than that in anthers of
   Shatangju. The expression rised gradually after self-pollination. While
   it was first increasing, then it was decreasing after cross-pollination.
   The result from subcellular localization showed that the Cullin gene was
   localization in cell nucleus. Thus Cullin gene may participate in SI
   reaction in Wuzishatangju which provided a candidate gene potentially
   useful for self-incompatibility although its function still needs
   further confirmation.}},

Abstract = {{The potential pollinators of Nypa fruticans Wurmb. were studied from
   February to August 2013 after determining the natural pollinating
   strategy of the palm in Hagonoy, Davao del Sur, Mindanao, Philippines.
   Observations showed that all six replicates of both the emasculated
   inflorescence (percent fruit set, 42.17 +/- 33.16) and the untouched
   (control) inflorescence (percent fruit set, 55.17 +/- 27.75) had fruit
   sets significantly different over the bagged inflorescence (percent
   fruit set, 11.17 +/- 27.35) which fruit set developed only in three out
   of six replicates. The emasculated inflorescence reveals the important
   role of pollinating vectors, especially insects during the female
   anthesis. Potential insect pollinators hovering over tagged
   inflorescences were collected from three different sites in Talomo,
   Davao City, Carmen, Davao del Norte and Hagonoy, Davao del Sur at three
   periodic sampling, 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM and 3:00 PM for 14 days, the entire
   duration of male phase. Three species of coleopterans were identified,
   namely: Epuraea sp. 1 and Epztraea sp. 2 under the family Nitidulidae
   and one under the family Staphylinidae. They were observed in abundance
   inside the bracts of the male and female inflorescences. Three dipteran
   species were also identified, namely: Drosophila sp. 1 and Drosophila
   sp. 2 under the family Drosophilidae and one under the family
   Agromyzidae. The hymenopterans reckoned were the stingless bee,
   Tetragonula sp. and the Asian honeybee, Apis cerana under the family
   Apidae. Temporal distribution showed that Epuraea sp. 1 and Drosophila
   sp. 1 were consistently abundant at 9AM in all areas. The amount of
   pollen grains carried by or adhering to the body and appendages of the
   insects revealed that hymenopterans carried more pollen grains, but are
   known to carry them into their hives after foraging. Thus, the good
   amount of pollen grains recorded adhering to the bodies and appendages
   of Drosophila sp. 1 and Epuraea sp. 1 and their respective frequencies
   within the site established their apparently considerable role in the
   pollination of the N. fruticans inflorescences. The identification of
   insect species is also helpful in generating a comprehensive inventory
   of potential N. fruticans pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted to monitor the flight activities of the
   worker bees of Apis mellifera syriaca and their impact on pollination of
   watermelon Citrullus lanatus as affected by the growing area elevations.
   The experiment composed of three treatments, the control (covered
   plants); in which the plants were caged before flowering to prevent any
   contact with insect pollinators, the second treatment the plants were
   left opened to permit contact with honeybees (uncovered plants) and the
   third treatment the plants were supplementary pollinated with pollen
   from other plant (hand pollination). The results of this experiment
   showed that the viability of female flower stigmas lasted mostly to the
   early hours of the day at 11: 00 am for flowers produced in Madaba (780
   m above sea level), and lasted to the afternoon of the day at 14: 00 pm
   for flowers produced in Wadi Araba, Al Safi village (350 m below sea
   level). In general fruit set, seed set, number of fertile seeds, fruit
   weight, and fruit sugar content were significantly higher in uncovered
   followed by supplementary pollinated then covered plants while fruit
   length and fruit circumference were significantly higher in uncovered
   followed by covered and finally supplementary pollinated plants.
   Furthermore, fruit set, seed set, fruit weight, fruit circumference, and
   fruit total soluble solids percentage was significantly higher in plants
   grown above sea level than below sea level. Honey bees play an important
   role in the production of high quality and quantity of watermelon fruits
   for plants grown above or below sea level.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, pollinosis has been considered a ``national disease{''}
   with the big social problems in urban areas of Japan. In this study, the
   airborne behavior of cedar pollen in the Kanto plain of Japan was
   observed by a real time pollen automatic measuring instrument during the
   2014 pollination season. For calculating cedar pollen source
   contribution, the backward trajectory analysis was used for calculating
   72 hours of trajectories of air mass with the altitude of 500 m from the
   urban of Saitama city to different areas. It was found that cedar pollen
   grains transported to Saitama city were mainly derived from the forest
   of Gunma prefecture located on the north side of Saitama city and the
   forest of Kanagawa prefecture located on the south side of the city.
   Transportation of cedar pollen grains depends on the weather conditions,
   habitat density of cedar trees and transportation distance. The
   variations in daily pollen counts among different transporting times
   showed three pollen dispersal peaks observed in the morning, the day
   time and the night time, while these occurrence rates were different in
   each month. The peak pollen counts in the day time correlated positively
   with the daily maximum temperature. The highest pollen counts were
   observed in the night time within three pollen dispersal peaks. At the
   same time, the size-segregated allergenic particles were also collected
   using Andersen high-volume air samplers at the roadside of urban
   residential zones of Saitama city and on the 10th floor of the research
   building in Saitama University. Allergenic concentrations were measured
   by the surface plasmon resonance method with a Biacore J system. The
   highest airborne allergenic concentrations were observed in fine
   particles below 1.1 mu m. Moreover, the forward trajectory analysis was
   used for calculating 72 hours of trajectories of air mass with the
   altitude of 500 m from different cedar pollen source areas including the
   rainfall events. It was suggested that not only cedar pollen grains but
   also its allergenic particles were transported from different cedar
   forests as the source areas.}},

Abstract = {{Biological rhythmicity is presumed to be an advantageous genetic
   adaptation of fitness and survival value resulting from evolution of
   life forms in an environment that varies predictably-in-time during the
   24 h, month, and year. The 24 h light/dark cycle is the prime
   synchronizer of circadian periodicities, and its modulation over the
   course of the year, in terms of daytime photoperiod length, is a prime
   synchronizer of circannual periodicities. Circadian and circannual
   rhythms have been the major research focus of most scientists.
   Circa-monthly rhythms triggered or synchronized by the 29.5 day lunar
   cycle of nighttime light intensity, or specifically the light of the
   full moon, although explored in waterborne and certain other species,
   have received far less study, perhaps because of associations with
   ancient mythology and/or an attitude naturalistic studies are of lesser
   merit than ones that entail molecular mechanisms. In this editorial, we
   cite our recent discovery through multidisciplinary naturalistic
   investigation of a highly integrated circadian, circa-monthly, and
   circannual time structure, synchronized by the natural ambient
   nyctohemeral, lunar, and annual light cycles, of the Peruvian apple
   cactus (C. peruvianus) flowering and reproductive processes that occur
   in close temporal coordination with like rhythms of the honey bee as its
   pollinator. This finding led us to explore the preservation of this
   integrated biological time structure, synchronized and/or triggered by
   environmental light cues and cycles, in the reproduction of other
   species, including Homo sapiens, and how the artificial light
   environment of today in which humans reside may be negatively affecting
   human reproduction efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Insect pollination constitutes an ecosystem service of global
   importance, providing significant economic and aesthetic benefits as
   well as cultural value to human society, alongside vital ecological
   processes in terrestrial ecosystems. It is therefore important to
   understand how insect pollinator populations and communities respond to
   rapidly changing environments if we are to maintain healthy and
   effective pollinator services. This chapter considers the importance of
   conserving pollinator diversity to maintain a suite of functional traits
   and provide a diverse set of pollinator services. We explore how we can
   better understand and mitigate the factors that threaten insect
   pollinator richness, placing our discussion within the context of
   populations in predominantly agricultural landscapes in addition to
   urban environments. We highlight a selection of important evidence gaps,
   with a number of complementary research steps that can be taken to
   better understand: (i) the stability of pollinator communities in
   different landscapes in order to provide diverse pollinator services;
   (ii) how we can study the drivers of population change to mitigate the
   effects and support stable sources of pollinator services and (iii) how
   we can manage habitats in complex landscapes to support insect
   pollinators and provide sustainable pollinator services for the future.
   We advocate a collaborative effort to gain higher quality abundance data
   to understand the stability of pollinator populations and predict future
   trends. In addition, for effective mitigation strategies to be adopted,
   researchers need to conduct rigorous field testing of outcomes under
   different landscape settings, acknowledge the needs of end-users when
   developing research proposals and consider effective methods of
   knowledge transfer to ensure effective uptake of actions.}},

Title = {{First national-scale reconnaissance of neonicotinoid insecticides in
   streams across the USA}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{12-20}},
Abstract = {{Environmental context Neonicotinoids are under increased scrutiny
   because they have been implicated in pollinator declines and, more
   recently, as potential aquatic toxicants. Nevertheless, there is
   currently little information on concentrations of multiple
   neonicotinoids in surface water. This paper presents a summary of
   concentrations of six neonicotinoids in streams from across the United
   States in both urban and agricultural areas. These environmental data
   are important in determining the potential risk of neonicotinoids to
   non-target aquatic and terrestrial organisms.
   Abstract To better understand the fate and transport of neonicotinoid
   insecticides, water samples were collected from streams across the
   United States. In a nationwide study, at least one neonicotinoid was
   detected in 53\% of the samples collected, with imidacloprid detected
   most frequently (37\%), followed by clothianidin (24\%), thiamethoxam
   (21\%), dinotefuran (13\%), acetamiprid (3\%) and thiacloprid (0\%).
   Clothianidin and thiamethoxam concentrations were positively related to
   the percentage of the land use in cultivated crop production and
   imidacloprid concentrations were positively related to the percentage of
   urban area within the basin. Additional sampling was also conducted in
   targeted research areas to complement these national-scale results,
   including determining: (1) neonicotinoid concentrations during elevated
   flow conditions in an intensely agricultural region; (2) temporal
   patterns of neonicotinoids in heavily urbanised basins; (3)
   neonicotinoid concentrations in agricultural basins in a nationally
   important ecosystem; and (4) in-stream transport of neonicotinoids near
   a wastewater treatment plant. Across all study areas, at least one
   neonicotinoid was detected in 63\% of the 48 streams sampled.}},

Title = {{Building height matters: nesting activity of bees and wasps on vegetated
   roofs}},
Journal = {{ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{1-2, SI}},
Pages = {{88-96}},
Abstract = {{Vegetated, green infrastructure, including terraces, balconies, and
   vegetated roofs and walls are increasingly common in urban landscapes,
   elevating habitat into novel contexts above ground. Highly mobile
   species, like bees and wasps, are often seen foraging on green
   infrastructure, but whether nesting opportunities are facilitated is not
   known. Cavity-nesting bees and wasps that provision brood in human-made
   trap nests were monitored over three years on 29 vegetated and
   non-vegetated roofs in Toronto, Canada. The study identified 27 species
   nesting on rooftops but found that building height was negatively
   correlated with the abundance of brood cells provisioned in trap nests,
   and positively correlated with the number of unfinished nests. A decline
   in green space area within a 600 m radius around each rooftop resulted
   in decreasing species richness and abundance. Although the introduced
   bee, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius) occupied more sites than any other
   bee or wasp (27.6\%) and was the most abundant species, amounting to
   half (48.9\%) of all brood reared, native bees were 73\% of all bee
   species reared. The most abundant wasp was the native spider-collecting
   Trypoxylon collinum Smith (11.4\%), but the introduced aphid-collecting
   Psenulus pallipes (Panzer) occurred at more sites (24.1\%). For the
   pollination and pest controlling services they provide, bees and wasps
   should be considered in the design of vegetated roofs. Evidence here
   suggests that building height and surrounding green space at ground
   level impact bee and wasp diversity on vegetated roofs. Efforts
   supporting their populations using trap nests should target low- and
   mid-rise buildings (<5 building levels).}},

Abstract = {{Watermelon {[}Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. \& Nakai var. lanatus]
   is a cross-pollinating diploid species and is one of the most important
   dicotyledonous plants belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae due to its
   high nutritional value, rapid growth, sweet and juicy taste, and
   refreshing nature as a summer fruit. However, the insertion-deletion
   (InDel) markers available for watermelon cannot satisfy the demand to
   identify and map resistance genes in this major crop. In this study, we
   have characterised and developed numerous polymorphic InDel markers
   using Illumina re-sequencing of a male parental line that is resistant
   to Fusarium wilt. In total, 25,701 potential InDel markers were
   identified, with a mean size of 18 bp. From these, 7,387 potential InDel
   markers > 10 bp were selected and tested as candidate InDel markers to
   locate resistance genes for map-based cloning and polymorphism analysis.
   We designed and synthesised 69 primer pairs using Primer 3 software.
   Overall, 54 primer pairs detected polymorphism between the
   Fusarium-susceptible female parent `JSw01-1' and the Fusarium-resistant
   male parent `JRw08-3'. Among the 69 InDel markers, 54 (78.3\%) exhibited
   polymorphism at 179 PCR loci. Polymorphic information content (PIC)
   values ranged from 0.04 to 0.91, and the number of alleles per primer
   ranged from 1 to 11. The 54 InDel markers that were mined and exploited
   via Illumina re-sequencing of watermelon could accelerate the
   development of marker-assisted breeding and the progression of genetic
   research to understand resistance to Fusarium wilt in watermelon.}},

Pages = {{63-72}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Many cactus species produce `bird' flowers; however, the reproductive
   biology of the majority of these species has not been studied. Here, we
   report on a study of the pollination of two species from the
   Cleistocactus genus, cited as an ornithophilous genus, in the context of
   the different ways in which they are specialised to bird pollination. In
   addition, we re-evaluate the level of specialisation of previous studies
   of cacti with bird pollination and evaluate how common phenotypic
   specialisation to birds is in this family. Both Cleistocactus species
   exhibited ornithophilous floral traits. Cleistocactus baumannii was
   pollinated by hummingbirds, whereas Cleistocactus smaragdiflorus was
   pollinated by hummingbirds and bees. Pollination by birds has been
   recorded in 27 cactus species, many of which exhibit ornithophilous
   traits; however, they show generalised pollination systems with bees,
   bats or moths in addition to birds being their floral visitors. Of all
   cactus species, 27\% have reddish flowers. This trait is associated with
   diurnal anthesis and a tubular shape. Phenotypic specialisation to bird
   pollination is recognised in many cactus species; however, it is not
   predictive of functional and ecological specialisation in this family.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic diversity of Turkish watermelon genotypes selected from the

   landraces, open pollinated (OP), and commercial hybrid cultivars were
   also assessed for genetic relatedness. Fourteen SSR primers and 31 SRAP
   primer combinations were used in the experiment. Both SSR markers
   (100\%) and SRAP markers (97.3\%) generated high polymorphisms. Based on
   the SSR and SRAP data, the genetic similarity coefficients were
   calculated, and dendrograms were constructed using the unweighted
   pairgroup method with arithmetic average (UPGMA). Cluster and principle
   coordinate analyses indicated that Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus
   subspecies genotypes collected from the different regions of Turkey were
   closely genetically related. Overall, our results displayed low genetic
   variability within the Turkish watermelon germplasm in contrast with

Abstract = {{In a context of agricultural intensification and increasing
   urbanization, the biodiversity of farmed landscapes is a key to improve
   the sustainability of agro-ecosystems. We seek to ascertain the plant
   biodiversity of farmed and abandoned vineyards and olive-groves and to
   identify the factors underlying it: natural and cultural; on local,
   landscape, and regional scales.
   To do so, we recorded and calculated the floral biodiversity of 106
   georeferenced plots and 121 plot edges distributed across 6 French
   Mediterranean terroirs, surveyed the practices and perception of 55
   farmers, and mapped the landscapes of 20 communes in a GIS.
   Statistical tests proved that richness and spatial diversity on plots
   are favored by local low intensity management integrating heritage and
   landscape objectives. The presence of edges augments the richness and
   diversity around vineyards. The highest value of spatial diversity was
   found using the terroir variable. Maximum richness is found in olive
   groves which are maintained by amateur gardeners and located in the
   middle of the urbanization gradient. The diversity of biological traits
   is listed according to: (a) an herbaceous diversity gradient explained
   by management; (b) a specialization gradient explained by landscapes and
   distance to large urban areas.
   Our results draw perspectives to improve existing models of the links
   between agriculture, biodiversity, and landscape, considering cultural
   and geographical factors. They lead to recommendations regarding the
   management of landscapes based on local knowledge and good practices.

Abstract = {{In this study, the seedless mechanism of a new citrus cultivar
   Wuhegonggan' (HMWG) (Citrus sinensis x C. reticulata) was assessed.
   Results from pollen number per anther, abnormal pollen frequency, pollen
   viability and germination frequency analyses suggested that HMWG pollen
   had low fertility. Thus, male sterility contributed partly to the
   seedlessness of HMWG. Embryonic development of self- and
   cross-pollinated HMWG was abnormal. After self- and crosspollination,
   globular and heart-shaped embryos were observed after 2-3 weeks and
   heart- and torpedo-shaped embryos were detected at 4 weeks. However,
   embryos began to degenerate at 5 weeks and debris from degenerated
   embryos, or an empty cavity, was observed in the ovary at 7 weeks. These
   results demonstrate that seedlessness of HMWG results from male
   sterility and embryo abortion.}},

Abstract = {{Properly arranged ornamental gardens in both urban and agricultural
   landscapes can be of a benefit to bees. In this study, we observed the
   flowering phenology, nectar, and pollen production of the ornamental
   Hosta species and varieties (H. sieboldiana Engler, H. capitata Nakai,
   H. crispula Maekawa, H. fluctuans Maekawa, syn. H. sieboldiana var.
   fluctuans hort., H. undulata var. univittata Miquel (Hylander), syn. H.
   univittata). Our experiment was conducted in the 2012 - 2014 time
   period, at the UMCS Botanical Garden in Lublin, Poland (51 degrees 14'
   N, 21 degrees 34' E). The total sugar yield varied almost 5-fold among
   Hosta ornamentals; the lowest amount was calculated for H. fluctuans
   (2.31 g per 10 m(2)) and the highest for H. capitata (11.80 g per 10
   m(2)). The average pollen yield was from 0.24 g per 10 m(2) (H. undulata
   var. univittata) to 9.53 g per 10 m(2) (H. capitata). Pollen grains were
   bilaterally symmetrical, and large-sized. In polar view, they were
   prolatum (shape index 1.33 - 1.61), while in equatorial view, oblatum
   (shape index 0.5 - 0.7). Hosta species can complete the summer pasture
   mainly for bumblebees. In four of the five Hosta representatives,
   bumblebees accounted for 60 - 70\% of the total visits. The honeybee
   predominated only on the flowers of H. capitata (54 - 71\%). Solitary
   bees were rarely observed (3 - 9\% of visits). The phenotypic traits of
   Hosta flowers (the accumulation of nectar in the deep and narrow
   perianth tube) reduced the access to nectar reward and restricted an
   array of insect visitors.}},

Abstract = {{In order to secure pollination services and improve conservation
   strategies, a better understanding of factors influencing population
   structure of pollinator species is vital. Here, we aimed to empirically
   evaluate various individual-and population-based statistical methods for
   characterization of genetic structure of the widespread dronefly,
   Eristalis tenax. Thirty-five European populations, comprising 888
   individuals, were genotyped at five polymorphic allozyme loci. Three
   Bayesian genotypic clustering approaches (STRUCTURE, BAPS and Geneland),
   pairwise F-ST estimates, analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA),
   principle component analysis (PCA) and Mantel tests were applied in a
   comparative way in attempt to reveal the patterns of gene flow that
   occurs at various spatial scales in E. tenax. STRUCTURE analysis and PCA
   results provided no evidence of conspecific differentiation. In
   contrast, BAPS and Geneland clustering solutions did acknowledge low but
   significant proportion of among-populations genetic variation revealed
   by AMOVA. Similarly, pairwise FST estimates partially argue against
   genetic homogeneity across Europe. The lack of correlation between
   genetic distance and both latitude and longitude variation suggests that
   the flies disperse in multiple directions. Therefore, our results
   indicate that continued long-range dispersal tend to homogenize
   populations over time, resulting in little population structure in E.
   tenax across the European landmass. On the other hand, significant
   differentiations between geographically proximate populations indicate
   that dispersal potential may not be realized and that gene flow patterns
   in E. tenax might be geographically complex. Using information from our
   genetic approaches will be useful for identifying patterns of migration
   and population connectivity across continent, which is an important
   issue for conservation efforts. Since E. tenax is an important
   pollinator, our results contribute to understanding the potential extent
   to which this taxon can facilitate gene flow among plant populations
   across natural and semi-natural habitats, agroecosystems and urban
   environments. Dronefly-mediated gene flow in plants is likely to occur
   over large distances and plant-dronefly conservation will require
   large-scale action.}},

Abstract = {{Seed predalion and dispersal can have strong, albeit opposing effects on
   plant communities and their extent depends on interactions between seeds
   and their vectors (abiotic factors or different animal taxa). We assume
   that vectors, due to their specific requirements, act at different
   spatial scales and seed-vector interactions might differ greatly between
   landscapes. So far, it remains largely unclear, how the interaction
   between seeds and their vectors affects the degree of seed predation and
   dispersal in novel anthropogenic landscapes. We expect changes in
   patterns either at the landscape scale (urban vs rural areas), habitat
   scale (habitat heterogeneity) or microhabitat scale (vegetation
   variability).
   We assessed seed predation and dispersal of two seed species by rodents,
   earthworms, other invertebrates and rain in cafeteria experiments in
   urban gardens and rural field margins and implemented generalized mixed
   effect models to test the effect of spatial scales and other
   environmental variables.
   Seed predation and dispersal were generally low and similar patterns
   emerged when he same vector facilitated the function. Overall, predation
   and dispersal were similar in urban and rural areas but when
   differentiating between vectors, scale effects were `dent. Seed
   predation by rodents and earthworms was affected at the landscape scale,
   seed predation by other invertebrates increased with higher habitat
   heterogeneity and seed dispersal by rain was negatively affected at the
   microhabitat scale through increased plant cover.
   We show that one vector can facilitate the contrasting two functions,
   seed predation and dispersal, simultaneously, resulting in similar
   patterns at a specific spatial scale however, different vectors might
   lead to contrasting patterns for the same function, depending on the
   spatial scale. This needs to be considered especially in anthropogenic
   areas, where ecosystem management decisions are also made at different
   spatial scales from private garden owners to landscape planning
   committees.}},

Abstract = {{The species Dactylis glomerata is one of the most important sources of
   airborne grass pollen in the atmosphere of temperate countries. The aim
   of this study was to determine the relationship between flowers, weather
   and the contribution of their pollen in the air. The plants were
   cultivated in an experimental garden in south-western Spain, which lies
   next to a spore trap and a meteorological station. The flower phenology
   and variation in the number of inflorescences were studied for 6 years
   (2009-2014); flower and pollen production were analysed in the first and
   third years of the study. The flowering process occurs within 20 (11-28)
   days, commencing at the end of April and extending to the end of May.
   The average number of days with open flowers per inflorescence was 10.1
   (3-17), and rain lengthened this period. There was a statistically
   significant negative correlation between the number of days in flowering
   and the flowering onset. The first inflorescences were larger and
   flowered longer than the final ones. The spikelets and flowers along the
   inflorescence were not distributed evenly and were more abundant in the
   middle. The approximation of total pollen production per plant was, on
   average, approximately 50 million, with differences depending upon the
   number of inflorescences per plant, which averaged 23.7 (3-108). In
   Mediterranean areas, D. glomerata flowering occurs within a short period
   of time, in the middle of spring, but rainy spells lengthen this period.
   The airborne grass pollen season was influenced by the pollen production
   of this species during the first half of this pollen season.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of the complex ecological interaction between fig wasps
   and their host plants in Amazonia requires previous knowledge of their
   distribution and diversity. The objective of this study was to describe
   the composition and structure of the wasp community associated with four
   species of Ficus in the municipal area of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. A
   total of 600 syconia from four species were collected. The study species
   were: Ficus obtusifolia Kunth; Ficus citrifolia Mill; E americana
   subspecies guianensis Desv. form mathewsii; and E americana subspecies
   guianensis Desv. form parkeriana. Statistical analyses were used to
   examine the relationship between fig wasp diversity and syconium
   diameter, and the effect of non-pollinating wasps on numbers of
   pollinators and seeds. Forty three species of fig wasp were identified,
   distributed across seven genera (Pegoscapus, Idarnes, Aepocerus,
   Physothorax, Anidarnes, Heterandrium, Eurytoma). Idarnes (carme group)
   was the wasps genus non-pollinator with greatest number of individuals
   with the greatest number of infested syconia (7409 wasps in 376
   syconia). Analysing non-pollinating wasp diversity in relation to fig
   diameter, a significant difference was observed between the four fig
   species. Ficus citrifolia and E americana subspecies guianensis form
   mathewsii had the smallest diameter but the greatest diversity of fig
   wasp. Ficus obtusifolia was the only species in which the
   non-pollinating wasps had a significant negative effect on the number of
   Pegoscapus sp. and on seed production.}},

Abstract = {{We engaged experts in various fields of study (pollination ecology,
   chemical ecology, and ethnobotany), invited community participation, and
   provided environmental education in an effort to conserve an endangered
   birthwort (Aristolochia delavayi) and a vulnerable pipevine swallowtail
   (Byasa daemonius). Scientists studied the uptake and sequestration of
   the secondarymetabolites aristolochic acids from A. delavayi leaves by
   different stages of pipevine swallowtail as a defense mechanism; low
   fruit set of the myophilous A. delavayi due to pollinator limitation;
   and the emission of chemical signals that attract parasitic wasps by the
   prepupae of B. daemonius. The results of these studies were part of an
   education program delivered by personnel of non-governmental
   organizations. The program was devised to deliver information to the
   public about the health risks of consuming A. delavayi individuals
   (aristolochic-acid-associated cancers) and to establish a bridge between
   the public and scientific research. Following delivery of the program,
   the behavior of residents changed considerably. Community residents were
   involved in management activities, including participation in a program
   to promote understanding of ecological interactions between A. delavayi
   and B. daemonius; designing an in situ conservation site; monitoring A.
   delavayi and B. daemonius individuals; and promoting the natural fruit
   set of A. delavayi by scattering animal excrement to attract fly
   pollinators. The integration of scientific information and community
   participation appears to have resulted in an increase in abundance of
   threatened A. delavayi and B. daemonius populations. We believe the
   involvement of local people in conservation is necessary for successful
   species conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization has the potential to dramatically affect insect populations
   worldwide, although its effects on pollinator populations are just
   beginning to be understood. We compared the immunocompetency of honey
   bees sampled from feral (wild-living) and managed (beekeeper-owned)
   honey bee colonies. We sampled foragers from feral and managed colonies
   in rural, suburban, and urban landscapes in and around Raleigh, NC, USA.
   We then analyzed adult workers using two standard bioassays for insect
   immune function (encapsulation response and phenoloxidase activity). We
   found that there was far more variation within colonies for
   encapsulation response or phenoloxidase activity than among rural to
   urban landscapes, and we did not observe any significant difference in
   immune response between feral and managed bees. These findings suggest
   that social pollinators, like honey bees, may be sufficiently robust or
   variable in their immune responses to obscure any subtle effects of
   urbanization. Additional studies of immune physiology and disease
   ecology of social and solitary bees in urban, suburban, and natural
   ecosystems will provide insights into the relative effects of changing
   urban environments on several important factors that influence
   pollinator productivity and health.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are a functionally important and economically valuable group, but
   are threatened by land-use conversion and intensification. Such
   pressures are not expected to affect all species identically; rather,
   they are likely to be mediated by the species' ecological traits.
   Understanding which types of species are most vulnerable under which
   land uses is an important step towards effective conservation planning.
   We collated occurrence and abundance data for 257 bee species at 1584
   European sites from surveys reported in 30 published papers (70056
   records) and combined them with species-level ecological trait data. We
   used mixed-effects models to assess the importance of land use (land-use
   class, agricultural use-intensity and a remotely-sensed measure of
   vegetation), traits and traitxland-use interactions, in explaining
   species occurrence and abundance. Species' sensitivity to land use was
   most strongly influenced by flight season duration and foraging range,
   but also by niche breadth, reproductive strategy and phenology, with
   effects that differed among cropland, pastoral and urban
   habitats.Synthesis and applications. Rather than targeting particular
   species or settings, conservation actions may be more effective if
   focused on mitigating situations where species' traits strongly and
   negatively interact with land-use pressures. We find evidence that
   low-intensity agriculture can maintain relatively diverse bee
   communities; in more intensive settings, added floral resources may be
   beneficial, but will require careful placement with respect to foraging
   ranges of smaller bee species. Protection of semi-natural habitats is
   essential, however; in particular, conversion to urban environments
   could have severe effects on bee diversity and pollination services. Our
   results highlight the importance of exploring how ecological traits
   mediate species responses to human impacts, but further research is
   needed to enhance the predictive ability of such analyses.

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) production relies on insect-mediated
   pollination, which is provided by managed and wild pollinators. The
   goals of this study were to measure the visitation frequency, longevity
   and temporal activity patterns of pumpkin pollinators and to determine
   if local habitat management and landscape composition affected this
   pollination service. We used video surveillance to monitor bee acitivty
   within male and female pumpkin flowers in 2011 and 2012 across a
   pollination window of 0600-1200 h. We also quantified the amount of
   pollen deposited in female flowers across this time period. In 2011, A.
   mellifera made significantly more floral visits than other bees, and in
   2012 Bombus spp. was the dominant pumpkin pollinator. We found variation
   in visitation among male and female pumpkin flowers, with A. mellifera
   visiting female flowers more often and spending longer per visit within
   them than male flowers in both 2011 and 2012. The squash bee P. pruinosa
   visited male flowers more frequently in 2012, but individuals spent
   equal time in both flower sexes. We did not find variation in the timing
   of flower visitation among species across the observed pollination
   window. In both 2011 and 2012 we found that the majority of pollen
   deposition occurred within the first two hours (0600-0800 h) of
   observation; there was no difference between the pollen deposited during
   this two-hour period and full pollination window (0600-1200 h). Local
   additions of sweet alyssum floral strips or a field buffer strip of
   native wildflowers did not have an effect on the foraging activity of
   bees or pollen deposition. However, semi-natural and urban habitats in
   the surrounding landscape were positively correlated with the frequency
   of flower visitation by wild pollinators and the amount of pollen
   deposited within female flowers.}},

Title = {{Urbanization Increases Pathogen Pressure on Feral and Managed Honey Bees}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Given the role of infectious disease in global pollinator decline, there
   is a need to understand factors that shape pathogen susceptibility and
   transmission in bees. Here we ask how urbanization affects the immune
   response and pathogen load of feral and managed colonies of honey bees
   (Apis mellifera Linnaeus), the predominant economically important
   pollinator worldwide. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we measured
   expression of 4 immune genes and relative abundance of 10 honey bee
   pathogens. We also measured worker survival in a laboratory bioassay. We
   found that pathogen pressure on honey bees increased with urbanization
   and management, and the probability of worker survival declined 3-fold
   along our urbanization gradient. The effect of management on pathogens
   appears to be mediated by immunity, with feral bees expressing immune
   genes at nearly twice the levels of managed bees following an immune
   challenge. The effect of urbanization, however, was not linked with
   immunity; instead, urbanization may favor viability and transmission of
   some disease agents. Feral colonies, with lower disease burdens and
   stronger immune responses, may illuminate ways to improve honey bee
   management. The previously unexamined effects of urbanization on
   honey-bee disease are concerning, suggesting that urban areas may favor
   problematic diseases of pollinators.}},

Title = {{Cryptic indirect effects of exurban edges on a woodland community}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},

Abstract = {{Exurban development (e.g., second homes) in woodlands spreads urban land
   use impacts beyond suburbs, but because exurban developments often
   retain many components of original ecosystem structure-such as a forest
   canopy rather than open lawn-their ecological impacts may be
   underestimated. Changes in seed-dispersing ant behavior prompted by
   exurban land use, such as edge avoidance, may pose deleterious impacts
   on the woodland plants (myrmecochores) they disperse, and hence the
   floristic diversity of exurban forests. We examined the effects of
   exurbanization on seed-dispersing ant nesting and foraging, seed
   retrieval, dispersal direction and subsequent impact on myrmecochores.
   We used a matrix of forested and exurbanized habitats to test whether
   (1) exurban edges decrease ant nest colonization and seed foraging, (2)
   ants disperse seeds away from exurban edges, and (3) consequently, there
   is lower ant-dispersed plant abundance nearer exurban edges. We found
   that exurban development poses little impact on keystone seed-dispersing
   ants because they foraged, colonized and thrived in fragmented woodland
   habitats as well as they did in intact forests. Exurban edges changed
   ant behavior, however, so that they generally moved seeds toward forest
   interiors, and, hence, away from edges. Corresponding to this behavioral
   change, we found that ant-dispersed plants declined with proximity to
   edges, whereas other woodland herbs with dispersal modes other than ants
   were unaffected. Exurbanization poses little threat to seed-dispersing
   ant viability, but, by changing foraging patterns (specifically,
   limiting the directionality of dispersal), it indirectly threatens the
   plants they disperse. Edge effects on biota commonly are associated with
   cascades through abiotic resources, but we show a deleterious biotic
   cascade between exurban edge, keystone ants and herbaceous plants.
   Species-mediated services, such as seed dispersal and pollination, are
   key resources, and assessing the full consequences of land use change
   therefore necessitates evaluation of impacts on biotic interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Most species of bees nest underground. Recent interest in
   pollinator-friendly gardens and landscaping focuses on planting suitable
   flowering species for bees, but we know little about providing for the
   ground-nesting needs of bees other than leaving them bare dirt surfaces.
   In this study, a surface layer of decorative flat stream pebbles was
   experimentally deployed in 24 paired subplots amid a nesting aggregation
   of the bee Halictus rubicundus. Over 2 years, females consistently
   preferred to nest amid the pebbles rather than adjacent bare dirt.
   Species of Halictus and their relatives (Lasioglossum, Dialictus) are
   widespread native floral generalists found in many urban areas of the
   northern hemisphere. Discovery of this practical soil nesting
   enhancement for H. rubicundus offers an aesthetically acceptable
   landscaping technique to promote these bees' nesting, particularly where
   pollinator gardens and bee-friendly landscaping is already being
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees play an important role as pollinators of many crop plants
   and wild flowers. As in many wild bees, their abundance and diversity
   have declined in recent years, which may threaten the stability of
   pollination services. The observed decline is often linked with the loss
   or alteration of natural habitat, e.g., through urbanization, the
   conversion of natural habitat into largely sealed areas (concrete)
   inhabited by humans. The effects of urbanization on bumble bees remain
   as yet controversial with both positive and negative effects reported.
   We investigated how habitat isolation through increasing areas of
   concrete, as well as the diversity, abundance, and community composition
   of floral resources, determine bumble bee abundance and diversity in
   cities. We found plant species diversity and abundance to be more
   important than the amount of concrete in driving the abundance and
   species richness of common bumble bees in a German city. Moreover, plant
   species composition, i.e., the presence of specific plant species and
   families (e.g., Fabaceae), played a prominent role. In particular,
   flower-rich parks and gardens can offer a continuous food supply for
   bumble bees and attract bumble bee foragers even to isolated patches in
   the city center.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing diversity of highly specialized pollination systems are
   being discovered, many of which are likely to be vulnerable to
   anthropogenic landscape modification. Here, we investigate if a
   specialized pollination system limits the persistence of Caladenia
   huegelii (Orchidaceae), an endangered species pollinated by sexual
   deception of thynnine wasps. Once locally common in part of its
   geographical range, C. huegelii is now largely restricted to small
   habitat remnants in urban areas. Pollinator surveys coupled with DNA
   barcoding detected a single pollinator taxon, a small form of
   Macrothynnus insignis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that small M.
   insignis from within the range of C. huegelii are strongly divergent
   from other wasp populations, suggesting that some reproductive isolation
   may exist. Although common in intact landscapes outside the range of C.
   huegelli, small M. insignis individuals were recorded at only 4\% of
   sites in suitable C. huegelii habitat. Accordingly, reproductive success
   in C. huegelii was low compared with related Caladenia spp., with
   33-60\% of populations failing to set fruit in any given year. As such,
   populations are likely to now persist primarily through individual plant
   longevity rather than reproduction. Due to the low reproductive success
   of C. huegelii, ongoing human intervention will almost certainly be
   needed to sustain the species. Future research will need to focus on
   optimizing hand pollination to maintain reproduction and high seed
   fitness. (C) 2015 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{Plantings in residential neighborhoods can support wild pollinators.
   However, it is unknown how effectively wild pollinators maintain
   pollination services in small, urban gardens with diverse floral
   resources. We used a `mobile garden' experimental design, whereby potted
   plants of cucumber, eggplant, and purple coneflower were brought to 30
   residential yards in Chicago, IL, USA, to enable direct assessment of
   pollination services provided by wild pollinator communities. We
   measured fruit and seed set and investigated the effect of within-yard
   characteristics and adjacent floral resources on plant pollination.
   Increased pollinator visitation and taxonomic richness generally led to
   increases in fruit and seed set for all focal plants. Furthermore, fruit
   and seed set were correlated across the three species, suggesting that
   pollination services vary across the landscape in ways that are
   consistent among different plant species. Plant species varied in terms
   of which pollinator groups provided the most visits and benefit for
   pollination. Cucumber pollination was linked to visitation by small
   sweat bees (Lasioglossum spp.), whereas eggplant pollination was linked
   to visits by bumble bees. Purple coneflower was visited by the most
   diverse group of pollinators and, perhaps due to this phenomenon, was
   more effectively pollinated in florally-rich gardens. Our results
   demonstrate how a diversity of wild bees supports pollination of
   multiple plant species, highlighting the importance of pollinator
   conservation within cities. Non-crop resources should continue to be
   planted in urban gardens, as these resources have a neutral and
   potentially positive effect on crop pollination.}},

   children with asthma living at sea level was statistically higher than
   that in children living in the high altitude group {[}p = 0.001, OR

Abstract = {{A characterization of the physical-chemical composition of the
   atmospheric PM adsorbed to airborne pollen was performed. Airborne
   pollen was sampled using a Hirst-type volumetric spore sampler and
   observed using a Field Emission Electron Probe Microanalyser for PM
   analysis. A secondary electron image was taken of each pollen grain and
   EDS spectra were obtained for individually adsorbed particles. All
   images were analysed and the size parameters of the particles adsorbed
   to pollen was determined. The measured particles' equivalent diameter
   varied between 0.1 and 25.8 mu m, mostly in the fine fraction. The
   dominant particulates identified were Si-rich, Organic-rich, SO-rich,
   Metals \& Oxides and Cl-rich. Significant daily differences were
   observed in the physical-chemical characteristics of particles adsorbed
   to the airborne pollen wall. These differences were correlated with
   weather parameters and atmospheric PM concentration. Airborne pollen has
   the ability to adsorb fine particles that may enhance its allergenicity.

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic impacts contribute to the fragmentation of urban mangrove
   forests, and in the Sydney region of Australia, Avicennia marina is
   commonly found in small stands of < 50 adult trees that have altered
   pollinator services. However, genetic diversity may not vary with stand
   size because insufficient time has passed since stands were established
   or pollen and propagule dispersal are sufficient to overwhelm the
   effects of genetic drift and founder events. We tested the predictions
   that, despite the potential of mangroves for dispersal of propagules by
   water and long distance dispersal of pollen by honeybees, fragmentation
   and localized foraging by honeybees causes small stands of A. marina to
   display reduced genetic diversity and elevated inbreeding. Using four
   microsatellite markers, we quantified the genetic and genotypic
   diversity present within samples of 20 adults taken from three large (>
   1500 trees), intermediate (300-500 trees) and small (< 50 trees) stands
   within each of two urbanized estuaries and estimated mating system
   parameters using progeny arrays for sets of five adults within the large
   and small stands. We detected no significant effect of stand size on
   levels of single-locus genetic diversity. There were low, although
   significant, levels of allelic differentiation within (F (SE) = 0.021, P
   = 0.003) and among (F (ET) = 0.055, P = 0.005) estuaries but no evidence
   of isolation by distance. In contrast, our analysis of progeny arrays
   revealed that, while all stands displayed high levels of biparental
   inbreeding, an expected consequence of pollination by honeybees, current
   outcrossing rates (t (m) ) were significantly lower in small (0.55) as
   compared to large (0.75) stands. The genetic makeup of the adult
   populations imply that stands are interconnected and suggest little
   impact of habitat fragmentation, while the progeny arrays suggest that
   plants within small stands may display reduced fitness.}},

Abstract = {{1. For the first time in more than a century, people across the planet
   are migrating en mass from cities to rural areas. In this process of
   exurbanisation' humans are rapidly converting natural and agricultural
   regions into low-density housing. Despite the scale of this exurban
   development and its potential negative impact on biodiversity, little is
   known about how this specific type of land conversion impacts wild
   pollinators. In this study, we conduct an extensive survey of the wild
   pollinators of the peach agroecosystem and investigate the impact of
   current and historic land use at multiple spatial scales on pollinator
   community composition within agroecological landscapes that have
   recently undergone exurban development. We reveal that the overall
   composition of the wild pollinator community is significantly associated
   with current local agricultural and natural land cover. Specifically,
   local agricultural land use was associated with ground-nesting bee
   community composition, whereas natural lands were associated with
   cavity-nesting bee composition, revealing that nesting materials drive
   community composition for these two groups in exurban habitats. In
   contrast, community composition for butterflies and flies, which made up
   the smallest proportion of our communities, were not strongly associated
   with any particular land use type, likely due to their non-central place
   foraging strategy. Most interestingly, our results indicate that
   historic land use remains a significant factor impacting the current
   abundance of all pollinators in the peach agroecosystem, offering the
   first evidence of extinction debt in this rapidly expanding exurban
   landscape.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{532}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{High levels of honey bee colony losses were recently reported from
   Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Turkey and the United States, raising
   concerns of a global pollinator decline and questioning current land use
   practices, in particular intense agricultural cropping systems.
   Sixty-seven crops (data from the years 20102012) and 66 mid-term stable
   land cover classes (data from 2007) were analysed for statistical
   relationships with the honey bee colony losses experienced over the
   winters 2010/11-2012/13 in Luxembourg (Western Europe). The area covered
   by each land cover class, the shortest distance between each land cover
   class and the respective apiary, the number of plots covered by each
   land use class and the size of the biggest plot of each land cover class
   within radii of 2 km and 5 km around 166 apiaries (2010), 184 apiaries
   (2011) and 188 apiaries (2012) were tested for correlations with honey
   bee colony losses (\% per apiary) experienced in the winter following
   the season when the crops were grown. Artificial water bodies, open
   urban areas, large industrial facilities including heavy industry,
   railways and associated installations, buildings and installations with
   socio-cultural purpose, camping-, sports-, playgrounds, golf courts,
   oilseed crops other than oilseed rape like sunflower or linseed, some
   spring cereals and former forest clearcuts or windthrows were the land
   cover classes most frequently associated with high honey bee colony
   losses. Grain maize, mixed forest and mixed coniferous forest were the
   land cover classes most frequently associated with low honey bee colony
   losses. The present data suggest that land covers related to transport,
   industry and leisure may have made a more substantial contribution to
   winter honey bee colony losses in developed countries than anticipated
   so far. Recommendations for the positioning of apiaries are discussed.

Title = {{Pronounced Seasonal Changes in the Movement Ecology of a Highly
   Gregarious Central-Place Forager, the African Straw-Coloured Fruit Bat
   (Eidolon helvum)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) migrate over vast distances
   across the African continent, probably following seasonal bursts of
   resource availability. This causes enormous fluctuations in population
   size, which in turn may influence the bats' impact on local ecosystems.
   We studied the movement ecology of this central-place forager with
   state-of-the-art GPS/acceleration loggers and concurrently monitored the
   seasonal fluctuation of the colony in Accra, Ghana. Habitat use on the
   landscape scale was assessed with remote sensing data as well as
   ground-truthing of foraging areas.
   Principal Findings
   During the wet season population low (similar to 4000 individuals), bats
   foraged locally (3.5-36.7 km) in urban areas with low tree cover. Major
   food sources during this period were fruits of introduced trees.
   Foraging distances almost tripled (24.1-87.9 km) during the dry season
   population peak (similar to 150,000 individuals), but this was not
   compensated for by reduced resting periods. Dry season foraging areas
   were random with regard to urban footprint and tree cover, and food
   consisted almost exclusively of nectar and pollen of native trees.
   Conclusions and Significance
   Our study suggests that straw-coloured fruit bats disperse seeds in the
   range of hundreds of meters up to dozens of kilometres, and pollinate
   trees for up to 88 km. Straw-coloured fruit bats forage over much larger
   distances compared to most other Old World fruit bats, thus providing
   vital ecosystem services across extensive landscapes. We recommend
   increased efforts aimed at maintaining E. helvum populations throughout
   Africa since their keystone role in various ecosystems is likely to
   increase due to the escalating loss of other seed dispersers as well as
   continued urbanization and habitat fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinating insects are vital to the survival of many primary producers
   in terrestrial ecosystems, as up to 80-85 \% of the world's flowering
   plants require pollinators for reproduction. Over the last few decades
   however, numerous pollinating insect populations have declined
   substantially. The causes of these declines are multifaceted and
   synergistic, and include pesticides, herbicides, monoculture,
   urbanization, disease, parasites, and climate change. Here, we present
   evidence for a generally understudied yet potentially significant source
   of pollinator mortality, collisions with vehicles. Negative impacts from
   roads have been observed for the majority of vertebrate groups but
   studies of the effects on invertebrates have remained largely absent
   from the scientific literature. We documented road mortality of
   pollinating insects along a 2 km stretch of highway in Ontario, Canada
   and used our findings to extrapolate expected levels of road mortality
   across a number of landscape scales. Our extrapolations demonstrate the
   potential for loss of hundreds of thousands (on our studied highway) to
   hundreds of billions (generalised across North America) of
   Lepidopterans, Hymenopterans and pollinating Dipterans each summer. Our
   projections of such high levels of annual road mortality highlight the
   need for research to assess whether the mortality levels observed are
   contributing to the substantial declines of pollinating insects
   occurring on a global scale, thus putting the ecological functioning of
   natural areas and agricultural productivity in jeopardy.}},

   aerial insects (pollinators): should we plant native or exotic species?}},

Abstract = {{Domestic gardens typically consist of a mixture of native and non-native
   plants which support biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem
   services, particularly in urban environments. Many gardeners wish to
   encourage biodiversity by choosing appropriate plant taxa. The value of
   native and non-native plants in supporting animal biodiversity is,
   however, largely unknown. The relative value of native and non-native
   garden plants to invertebrates was investigated in a replicated field
   experiment. Plots (deliberately akin to garden borders) were planted
   with one of three treatments, representing assemblages of plants based
   on origin (native, near-native and exotic). Invertebrates and resource
   measurements were recorded over fouryears. This paper reports the
   abundance of flower-visiting aerial insects (pollinators') associated
   with the three plant assemblages. For all pollinator groups on all
   treatments, greater floral resource resulted in an increase in visits.
   There was, however, a greater abundance of total pollinators recorded on
   native and near-native treatments compared with the exotic plots.
   Short-tongued bumblebees followed the same pattern whilst more
   hoverflies were recorded on the native treatment than the other
   treatments, and more honeybees on the near-native treatment. There was
   no difference between treatments in abundance of long-tongued bumblebees
   or solitary bees. The lack of difference in solitary bee abundance
   between treatments was probably due to a third of individuals from this
   group being recorded on one exotic plant species. The number of flower
   visitors corresponded to the peak flowering period of the treatments,
   that is there were fewer flower visitors to the exotic treatment
   compared with the other treatments in early summer but relatively more
   later in the season.Synthesis and applications. This experiment has
   demonstrated that utilizing plants from only a single region of origin
   (i.e. nativeness) may not be an optimal strategy for resource provision
   for pollinating insects in gardens. Gardens can be enhanced as a habitat
   by planting a variety of flowering plants, biased towards native and
   near-native species but with a selection of exotics to extend the
   flowering season and potentially provide resources for specialist
   groups.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Apis mellifera L. is the main pollinator of cultivated plants. With the
   increased emphasis on organic agriculture, the use of botanical
   insecticides has also increased. However, the effects of these products
   on bees remain to be determined. In this study, we aimed at assessing
   the acute toxicity and sublethal behavioral effects of botanical
   insecticides such as andiroba oil, citronella oil, eucalyptus oil,
   garlic extract, neem oil, and rotenone on honey bees, A. mellifera. Only
   andiroba oil demonstrated no lethality to A. mellifera adult workers.
   However, andiroba oil, garlic extract, and neem oil demonstrated an
   acute toxicity to bee larvae. Except for eucalyptus oil, larvae fed with
   syrup containing the other insecticides led to the development of lower
   body mass in adult workers. All these botanical insecticides were
   repellent to A. mellifera adult workers. In addition, the eucalyptus
   oil, garlic extract, neem oil, and rotenone decreased the rate of
   walking activity in adult workers. Our results demonstrate the potential
   acute toxicity and sublethal effects of botanical insecticides on honey
   bees and, thereby, provide evidence of the importance of assessing the
   risks of the side effects of bio-pesticides, often touted as
   environmentally friendly, to nontarget organisms such as pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about how salt impacts primary metabolic pathways of C-4
   plants, particularly related to kernel development and seed set. Osmotic
   stress was applied to maize (Zea mays) B73 by irrigation with increasing
   concentrations of NaCl from the initiation of floral organs until 3 d
   after pollination. At silking, photosynthesis was reduced to only 2\% of
   control plants. Salt treatment was found to reduce spikelet growth, silk
   growth, and kernel set. Osmotic stress resulted in higher concentrations
   of sucrose (Suc) and hexose sugars in leaf, cob, and kernels at silking,
   pollination, and 3 d after pollination. Citric acid cycle intermediates
   were lower in salt-treated tissues, indicating that these sugars were
   unavailable for use in respiration. The sugar-signaling metabolite
   trehalose-6-phosphate was elevated in leaf, cob, and kernels at silking
   as a consequence of salt treatment but decreased thereafter even as Suc
   levels continued to rise. Interestingly, the transcripts of trehalose
   pathway genes were most affected by salt treatment in leaf tissue. On
   the other hand, transcripts of the SUCROSE NONFERMENTING-RELATED KINASE1
   (SnRK1) marker genes were most affected in reproductive tissue. Overall,
   both source and sink strength are reduced by salt, and the data indicate
   that trehalose-6-phosphate and SnRK1 may have different roles in source
   and sink tissues. Kernel abortion resulting from osmotic stress is not
   from a lack of carbohydrate reserves but from the inability to utilize
   these energy reserves.}},

Abstract = {{Ornamental flowers commonly grown in urban gardens and parks can be of
   value to flower-visiting insects. However, there is huge variation in
   the number of insects attracted among plant varieties. In this study, we
   quantified the insect attractiveness of 79 varieties in full bloom being
   grown in a public urban garden that is popular due to its beautiful
   flowers and other attractions. The results showed very clearly that most
   varieties (77\%, n = 61) were either poorly attractive or completely
   unattractive to insect flower visitors. Several varieties (19\%, n = 15)
   were moderately attractive, but very few (4\%, n = 3) were highly
   attractive. Closer examination of Dahlia varieties showed that open
   flowered forms were approximately 20 times more attractive than closed
   flowered forms. These results strongly suggest that there is a great
   potential for making urban parks and gardens considerably more bee- and
   insect-friendly by selecting appropriate varieties.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation is likely to have deleterious genetic consequences
   for plant populations. Although the genetic effects of fragmentation in
   plants have been investigated in various landscapes, such studies are
   scarce in urban landscapes where forests tend to be fragmented and have
   a complex internal structure.
   This study aimed to determine the factors, including patch and sub-patch
   level spatial factors, affecting the genetic diversity of a herbaceous
   species in urban fragmented forests.
   We collected 30-39 leaf samples of Viola grypoceras A. Gray var.
   grypoceras, a perennial herbaceous species with short-distance seed
   dispersal, from 12 fragmented and 12 suburban forests each at Kyoto
   City, Japan, and analyzed the genetic diversity of this species by
   developing six simple sequence repeat markers. Field survey was
   conducted to collect demographic and spatial data.
   There was no significant difference in allelic richness between the
   urban fragmented and suburban forests. However, statistical analysis
   revealed that the area of vegetation, distribution pattern of
   populations in a forest, and average distance between nearest
   populations affected the genetic diversity of this species in urban
   fragmented forests.
   Although V. grypoceras has traits that allow it to tolerate
   fragmentation, such as self-pollination and seed bank-formation ability,
   pure loss of habitat and reduced fragment size might have deleterious
   effects on this species, and these effects might become more apparent if
   fragmentation continues to proceed in the future.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed the relative role of landscape context (city, suburb and

   plant diversity of natural forests in Wuhan city. The results indicated
   that landscape context had significant effects on plant diversity, and
   both landscape context and distance to the edge affect vegetation and
   disturbance characteristics. Landscape context was the main factor
   affecting richness of woods, herbs, indigenous species, forest
   generalists and insect or wind pollination species. These species tended
   to be higher in exurban forests while non-indigenous species were higher
   in the urban forests. The number of non-indigenous species, forest
   specialists, herbs and insect pollination species also depended on
   distance to the edge or on both interactions. Richness of non-indigenous
   species decreased with increasing distance to the edge in urban forest.
   Vegetation characteristics that shrub cover was lower and disturbance
   characteristics that disturbed cover and human activity were higher in
   the urban edge than in the suburb and exurb edge, which decreased from
   the edge to the interior. Therefore, we should prioritize the
   preservation of less disturbed and frequented forests (suburban and

Abstract = {{Handroanthus heptaphyllus is a long-lived tropical tree,
   insect-pollinated, common in secondary vegetation, and is economical
   useful for urban and forest restoration purposes. However, when
   considering seed harvest for reforestation, it is fundamental to know
   the mating system of populations, since that determines the effective
   size of the sample. Therefore, the objective of this work was to study
   the mating system of two H. heptaphyllus populations, using
   microsatellite markers, to estimate the number of seed trees for seed
   collection procedures. To do that, open pollinated seeds were collected
   from 15 seed trees in a Lageado population and from 15 at Veu da Noiva.
   Population multilocus outcrossing rate (t(m)) was equal for the two
   provenances (t(m) = 1.0), however we observed individual variation for
   outcrossing rate among trees (0.68 to 0.99). The rate of mating among
   relatives (t(m) - t(s), minimum of 0.21) and multilocus paternity
   correlation (r(p), minimum of 0.11) were substantial in both
   populations, where 97\% of the trees crossed with relatives. This
   suggests a spatial genetic structure in the populations from where seeds
   were harvested. Due to correlated mating, the co-ancestry within
   progenies was higher (Theta minimum of 0.139) and effective size was
   smaller (Theta maximum of 3.07) than the expected in half-sibs (Theta =

Abstract = {{Plant S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1) genes play crucial
   roles in plant development and differentiation. However, the role of
   SKP1 in citrus is unclear. Herein, we described a novel SKP1-like gene,
   designated as CrWSKP1, from Wuzishatangju (Citrus reticulata Blanco).
   The cDNA sequence of CrWSKP1 is 779 base pairs (bp) and contains an open
   reading frame (ORF) of 477 bp. The genomic sequence of the CrWSKP1 gene
   is 1296 bp with two exons and one intron. CrWSKP1 has high identity with
   SKP1-like genes from other plant species within two conserved regions.
   Approximately 85\% of pollen tubes of self-pollinated CrWSKP1 transgenic
   tobaccos became twisted at four days after self-pollination. Pollen tube
   numbers of self-pollinated CrWSKP1 transformants entering into ovules
   were significantly fewer than that of the control. Seed number of
   self-pollinated CrWSKP1 transformants was significantly reduced. These
   results suggested that the CrWSKP1 is involved in the
   self-incompatibility (SI) reaction of Wuzishatangju.}},

Abstract = {{The endogenous levels of 13 gibberellins (GAs), three cytokinins (CKs),
   abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and jasmonic acid (JA)
   were analyzed in naturally pollinated ovaries of three mandarin
   cultivars selected for their different capacity to produce seeds and
   their differing parthenocarpic ability. The varieties compared were
   Murcott (pollen self-compatible, highly seeded), Moncada
   (self-incompatible, moderately seeded), and Moncalina (pollen sterile,
   seedless), obtained from Moncada by bud gamma-irradiation. As expected,
   the 13-hydroxylation pathway was predominant in ovaries and our results
   further indicate that cultivar differences exist in GA metabolism. The
   active gibberellin GA(1) levels in ovaries seems to be related with
   presence of fertilized ovules and, therefore, with the ability to
   produce the seeds of a variety. Sterility gamma irradiation arrested the
   biosynthesis of GA(1) and its precursor GA(19) in Moncalina ovaries if
   compared to Moncada. The productive efficiency of the studied cultivars
   also indicated that fruit set depends strongly on the GA(1) level
   achieved by ovaries, which is also closely related with carbohydrate
   content. The study of the expression of gibberellin-oxidase genes showed
   that the pollination/fecundation process enhances GA20ox2 and GA3ox1
   activities in naturally pollinated Murcott and Moncada ovaries compared
   with unpollinated Murcott and Moncalina, respectively. GA2ox1 expression
   was lower in the ovaries of the highly seeded cultivar Murcott than in
   those of Moncada or Moncalina. Unpollinated Murcott ovaries contained
   much lower levels of GA(1) and IAA than the naturally pollinated ovaries
   of this cultivar. Conversely, unpollinated ovaries, which exhibited 100
   \% abscission, had more ABA and JA contents. Cytokinin activity seemed
   constitutive and independent of pollination/fecundation. However,
   trans-zeatin (t-Z) and 2-isopentenyl adenine (2-IP) concentrations were
   higher in Murcott ovaries than in Moncada/Moncalina.}},

Abstract = {{1. Pollination by insects is a vital ecosystem service and the need for
   its assessment is increasing in recognition and political pressure, but
   there are currently no large-scale systematic monitoring schemes in
   place to measure the direct provision of this service. 2. This study
   tested a protocol for using a citizen science approach to quantify
   pollination service provision in gardens and allotments, requiring
   participants to grow Vica faba L. plants and carry out some simple
   manipulations of the pollination environment (flowers with bees
   excluded, flowers hand-pollinated, or flowers left for local pollinators
   to visit). Volunteers assessed yield in the three treatments. 3. Eighty
   participants from across the U.K. successfully completed all parts of
   the protocol; a further 93 participants were unsuccessful but actively
   engaged with the project. 4. Overall, the present results suggest that
   pollination services for V. faba are currently not limiting in gardens
   or allotments in the U.K. It is possible and cost-effective to recruit
   volunteers to collect data on pollination deficits using this protocol.
   5. The approach used in this paper, which could readily be extended to
   incorporate other plant species reliant on different guilds of
   pollinators, is feasible for adoption as a national monitoring scheme
   for pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{Urban agriculture can increase the sustainability of cities by reducing
   their ecological footprint, conserving biodiversity, and improving
   quality of life in a city. Given the environmental, economic and social
   value of urban agriculture, it is important to understand the ecosystem

   by wild bees affects tomato production on 16 urban agriculture sites in
   San Francisco, CA. By comparing four pollination service indicators
   (fruit set, fruit mass, yield, and seed set) in four pollination
   treatments (open, artificial-self, artificial-cross, control), we were
   able to determine that tomatoes pollinated by wild bees significantly
   outperform the control in terms of all four pollination service
   indicators measured. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate
   that urban areas can support adequate pollination service to urban
   agriculture, regardless of garden size, garden age, or proportion of
   impervious surface in the surrounding matrix, and that floral resource
   density is a major factor influencing pollination service.}},

Title = {{Strong and nonlinear effects of fragmentation on ecosystem service
   provision at multiple scales}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Human actions, such as converting natural land cover to agricultural or
   urban land, result in the loss and fragmentation of natural habitat,
   with important consequences for the provision of ecosystem services.
   Such habitat loss is especially important for services that are supplied
   by fragments of natural land cover and that depend on flows of
   organisms, matter, or people across the landscape to produce benefits,
   such as pollination, pest regulation, recreation and cultural services.
   However, our quantitative knowledge about precisely how different
   patterns of landscape fragmentation might affect the provision of these
   types of services is limited. We used a simple, spatially explicit model
   to evaluate the potential impact of natural land cover loss and
   fragmentation on the provision of hypothetical ecosystem services. Based
   on current literature, we assumed that fragments of natural land cover
   provide ecosystem services to the area surrounding them in a
   distance-dependent manner such that ecosystem service flow depended on
   proximity to fragments. We modeled seven different patterns of natural
   land cover loss across landscapes that varied in the overall level of
   landscape fragmentation. Our model predicts that natural land cover loss
   will have strong and unimodal effects on ecosystem service provision,
   with clear thresholds indicating rapid loss of service provision beyond
   critical levels of natural land cover loss. It also predicts the
   presence of a tradeoff between maximizing ecosystem service provision
   and conserving natural land cover, and a mismatch between ecosystem
   service provision at landscape versus finer spatial scales. Importantly,
   the pattern of landscape fragmentation mitigated or intensified these
   tradeoffs and mismatches. Our model suggests that managing patterns of
   natural land cover loss and fragmentation could help influence the
   provision of multiple ecosystem services and manage tradeoffs and
   synergies between services across different human-dominated landscapes.}},

Title = {{Remote sensing captures varying temporal patterns of vegetation between

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{Global change has led to shifts in phenology, potentially disrupting
   species interactions such as plant-pollinator relationships. Advances in
   remote sensing techniques allow one to detect vegetation phenological
   diversity between different land use types, but it is not clear how this
   translates to other communities in the ecosystem. Here, we investigated
   the phenological diversity of the vegetation across a human-altered
   landscape including urban, agricultural, and natural land use types. We
   found that the patterns of change in the vegetation indices (EVI and
   NDVI) of human-altered landscapes are out of synchronization with the
   phenology in neighboring natural California grassland habitat. Comparing
   these findings to a spatio-temporal pollinator distribution dataset, EVI
   and NDVI were significant predictors of total bee abundance, a
   relationship that improved with time lags. This evidence supports the
   importance of differences in temporal dynamics between land use types.
   These findings also highlight the potential to utilize remote sensing
   data to make predictions for components of biodiversity that have tight
   vegetation associations, such as pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{In light of population declines of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.),
   research has refocused attention on alternative pollinators and their
   potential to fulfill pollination services within economically important
   agricultural crops. Bumble bees are one such alternative, and within the
   past 20 yr, these pollinators have been reared and sold as commercial
   pollinators. Investigation into their use has been limited and more
   research is needed to improve pollinator effectiveness in field
   settings. Quad pollination units of the commercially reared native
   bumble bee species, the common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens
   Cresson), were monitored and evaluated for productivity during peak
   watermelon {[}Citrullus lanatus (Thunberg) Matsumura \& Nakai] bloom in
   southern Delaware. Differing colony exposures including various shade
   structure designs and natural shade were compared to assess the quality
   of the shade in regards to bumble bee activity during watermelon bloom.
   Quads receiving different nest treatments were evaluated on the basis of
   foraging activity and colony weight gain. Results indicated that
   colonies within quads provided with artificial or natural shade had
   significantly more foraging activity, weighed more, and produced more
   cells than colonies in quads placed in the field with no shade. Colonies
   within quads provided with artificial and natural shade peaked later in
   terms of foraging and weight gain, suggesting that growers could extend
   harvest to take advantage of later markets and possible movement into
   fields that were planted later.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{Wind-borne pollinating wasps (Agaonidae) can transport fig (Ficus sp.,
   Moraceae) pollen over enormous distances (> 100 km). Because of their
   extensive breeding areas, Neotropical figs are expected to exhibit weak
   patterns of genetic structure at local and regional scales. We evaluated
   genetic structure at the regional to continental scale (Panama, Costa
   Rica, and Peru) for the free-standing fig species Ficus insipida.
   Genetic differentiation was detected only at distances > 300 km (Jost's
   D-est = 0.68 +/- 0.07 \& F-ST = 0.30 +/- 0.03 between Mesoamerican and
   Amazonian sites) and evidence for phylogeographic structure
   (R-ST>>permuted R-ST) was only significant in comparisons between
   Central and South America. Further, we assessed local scale spatial
   genetic structure (SGS, d <= 8 km) in Panama and developed an
   agent-based model parameterized with data from F. insipida to estimate
   minimum pollination distances, which determine the contribution of
   pollen dispersal on SGS. The local scale data for F. insipida was
   compared to SGS data collected for an additional free-standing fig, F.
   yoponensis (subgenus Pharmacosycea), and two species of strangler figs,
   F. citrifolia and F. obtusifolia (subgenus Urostigma) sampled in Panama.
   All four species displayed significant SGS (mean Sp = 0.014 +/- 0.012).
   Model simulations indicated that most pollination events likely occur at
   distances > > 1 km, largely ruling out spatially limited pollen
   dispersal as the determinant of SGS in F. insipida and, by extension,
   the other fig species. Our results are consistent with the view that
   Ficus develops fine-scale SGS primarily as a result of localized seed
   dispersal and/or clumped seedling establishment despite extensive
   long-distance pollen dispersal. We discuss several ecological and life
   history factors that could have species-or subgenus-specific impacts on
   the genetic structure of Neotropical figs.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades, a gradual departure away from traditional
   agricultural practices has resulted in alterations to the composition of
   the countryside and landscapes across Europe. In the face of such
   changes, monitoring the development and productivity of honey bee
   colonies from different sites can give valuable insight on the influence
   of landscape on their productivity and might point towards future
   directions for modernized beekeeping practices. Using data on honeybee
   colony weights provided by electronic scales spread across Denmark, we
   investigated the effect of the immediate landscape on colony
   productivity. In order to extract meaningful information, data
   manipulation was necessary prior to analysis as a result of different
   management regimes or scales malfunction. Once this was carried out, we
   were able to show that colonies situated in landscapes composed of more
   than 50\% urban areas were significantly more productive than colonies
   situated in those with more than 50\% agricultural areas or those in
   mixed areas. As well as exploring some of the potential reasons for the
   observed differences, we discuss the value of weight monitoring of
   colonies on a large scale.}},

Abstract = {{Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism in higher plants
   that promotes outcrossing and prevents self-fertilization. `Banpeiyu'
   (Citrus maxima) and `Hyuganatsu' (Citrus tamurana), two of the Citrus
   cultivars distributed in Kyusyu, Japan, show gametophytic SI. In this
   study, we used the Citrus mature pollen culture system and stylar crude
   protein extracts to simulate compatible (C) and SI responses in
   `Banpeiyu' pollen tubes. We analyzed the protein changes in pollen tubes
   with the C- and SI-like treatments by nano-liquid chromatography mass
   spectrometry (nano-LC-MS); 14 and 27 proteins were identified in C- and
   SI-like treatments, respectively. We picked up some candidate genes that
   were particularly prevalent in SI-like treatment and analyzed their
   expression level changes during C- and SI-like treatments in `Banpeiyu'
   and `Hyuganatsu' pollen tubes. The expression levels of copper/zinc
   superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), manganese SOD (Mn SOD), catalase
   (CAT), and cysteine protease (CYP) increased after SI-like treatment. We
   used a fluorescent probe to visualize reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   level changes in `Banpeiyu' and `Hyuganatsu' pollen tubes after C- and
   SI-like treatments and found that 2-hour SI-like treatment induced ROS
   levels to increase in the pollen tubes of both cultivars. These results
   suggest that an ROS increase could be one of the key phenomena in the SI
   response of Citrus and that gene expression changes were responses to
   ROS generation.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the full-length cDNA of S1 family protein gene was cloned
   by RACE technique from Wuzishatangju (Citrus reticulate Blanco). The
   results revealed that S1 family protein was 814 bp, there were 453 bp in
   ORF sequences and encoded a 150 amino acid polypeptide. The S1 family
   protein was exclusively expressed in the anthers. When Wuzishatangju was
   self-pollinated, the expression level of S1 family protein in the
   pistils reached a maximum at 72 h and decreased thereafter. While
   Shatangju was cross-pollinated with Wuzishatangju, relative expressional
   level of S1 family protein was weakened at 72 h. The southern blot
   analysis indicated there were two copies of the S1 family protein in
   genomic DNA from Wuzishatangju. This study showed that S1 family protein
   may involve in the reaction of self-incompatibility in Wuzishatangju

Title = {{Does removal of invasives restore ecological networks? An experimental

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic disturbance can alter the structure of ecological networks
   in ways that have population consequences. For example, bird-plant
   networks in forests surrounded by urban land were more likely to be
   dominated by strong interactions (i.e., less even in strength) than
   networks in rural landscapes, and these asymmetric interactions
   depressed avian nest survival. Based on this prior research, we
   hypothesized that invasion of urban habitats by exotic plants was the
   underlying mechanism driving changes in network structure. We tested
   this hypothesis using an in situ experiment where exotic Amur
   honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) was removed from replicated 2-ha forest
   plots and compared bird-plant networks among urban removal forests,
   urban control forests dominated by honeysuckle, and rural forests with
   little honeysuckle. From 2005 to 2011, we surveyed densities of
   understory-nesting birds and nest predators, recorded information about
   nest location, and monitored nest survival. For each year and site
   network, we calculated evenness of interaction strengths. Despite
   post-removal vegetation resembling that in rural forests, removal of
   exotic honeysuckle did not restore network structure. Evenness of
   interactions between birds and plants was greatest in rural forests and
   least in urban control plots. Nest survival increased with evenness
   across all sites, but the relationship was strongest within urban
   removal plots, which had the lowest overall nest survival rates. Even
   though invasion by honeysuckle was a plausible driver of
   urban-associated network shifts in previous studies, the experimental
   removal suggested that factors other than invasion were responsible for
   network changes or that our system experienced hysteresis or time lags.
   Our study suggests that restoration of ecological networks may be more
   challenging than anticipated.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{187}},
Pages = {{240-248}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Networks of urban green space can provide critical resources for wild
   bees, however it is unclear which attributes of green spaces provide
   these resources, or how their management can be improved to benefit a
   diversity of bee species. We examined bee communities in three dominant
   urban green space habitats: (1) golf courses (2) public parks and (3)
   front gardens and streetscapes in residential neighbourhoods in
   Melbourne, Australia and assessed which local and landscape attributes
   influenced bee communities. There was a greater abundance and richness
   of bee species in public parks compared to golf courses and residential
   neighbourhoods, where the latter habitat was dominated by European
   Honeybees (Apis mellifera). The occurrence of A. mellifera was
   positively associated with increases in flowering and native plants.
   Ground-nesting Homalictus species occurred more frequently in older golf
   courses and public parks surrounded by low impervious surface cover, and
   with a low diversity of flowering plants. Cavity nesting, floral
   specialists within the Colletidae family occurred more often in green
   space habitats with greater native vegetation, and occurred infrequently
   in residential neighbourhoods. The lack of appropriate nesting habitat
   and dominance of exotic flowering plants in residential neighbourhoods
   appeared to positively impact upon the generalist A. mellifera, but
   negatively affected cavity and ground nesting floral specialist bee
   species (e.g. Halictidae and Colletidae). Our results highlight the need
   to include urban areas in pollinator conservation initiatives, as
   providing resources critical to diverse bee communities can assist in
   maintaining these key pollinators in urban landscapes. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Phenology is a key indicator and mediator of the ecological impacts of
   climate change. However, studies monitoring the phenology of individual
   species are moderate in number, taxonomically and geographically
   restricted, and mainly focused on spring events. As such, attention is
   being given to nonstandard sources of phenology data, such as the dates
   of species' biological records. Here, we present a conceptual framework
   for deriving phenological metrics from biological recording data, while
   accounting for seasonal variation in the level of activity by recorders.
   We develop a new Bayesian statistical model to infer the seasonal
   pattern of plant recordability'. The modelled dates of maximum
   recordability are strongly indicative of the flowering peaks of 29
   insect-pollinated species monitored in two botanic gardens in Great
   Britain. Conversely, not accounting for the seasonality in recording
   activity results in biased estimates of the observed flowering peaks.
   However, observed first and last flowering dates were less reliably
   explained by the model, which probably reflects greater interspecific
   variation in levels of recording before and after flowering. We conclude
   that our method provides new potential for gaining useful insights into
   large-scale variation in peak phenology across a much broader range of
   plant species than have previously been studied.(c) 2015 The Linnean

Abstract = {{Climate has been widely regarded as the main determinant of the
   geographical distribution of species. Biotic interactions between
   co-occurring species, however, are an important additional influence. We
   review the importance of interactions with food and nectar plants (as
   resources) in determining the distribution of phytophagous and
   pollinating insects (as consumers). We use biological recording datasets
   for seven taxonomic groups to quantify the relationship between the
   geographical distributions within Britain of 1265 phytophagous insects
   and their associated food plants, representing 9128 interactions in
   total. We find a consistent pattern across taxonomic groups in that
   individual phytophagous insect species rarely utilize the full range of
   their food plants and the relationship between the range sizes of
   insects and their food plants is not a simple linear one. For a small
   selection of phytophagous species where data are available, we highlight
   an association between changes in range and interactions with associated
   food plant species. Climate-driven range expansion may be constrained
   through disruption of trophic relationships between phytophagous insects
   and their food plants if they respond differently to abiotic drivers. By
   contrast, range expansion may be facilitated by temporary escape from
   natural enemies and/or exploitation of novel food plants that enable a
   broader set of habitats to be utilized. In a changing environment, some
   existing interactions will be disrupted but opportunities for novel
   interactions will also emerge, producing new assemblages and changes in
   distributions that will be dynamic yet hard to predict.(c) 2015 The

Title = {{Urban drivers of plant-pollinator interactions}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{7, SI}},
Pages = {{879-888}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Plant-pollinator interactions are affected by global change, with
   largely negative impacts on pollination and plant reproduction. Urban
   areas provide a unique and productive study system for understanding the
   impacts of many global change drivers on plant-pollinator interactions.
   2. We review the mechanistic pathways through which urban drivers alter
   plant-pollinator interactions. The literature on urban drivers of
   plant-pollinator interactions is small but growing and has already
   produced exciting insights about how population processes or pollinator
   behaviour interacts with landscape urban drivers to affect pollination
   outcomes.
   3. Habitat loss and fragmentation can change flower visitation rates and
   pollination success through changes in pollinator foraging behaviour or
   through population-level effects on pollinators. Urban environments,
   where impermeable surface provides an inhospitable matrix, may allow
   researchers to identify habitat fragments more clearly than in many
   other environments.
   4. Recent studies have found that non-native plants are not differently
   preferred by pollinators relative to native plants, therefore removing
   the basis for expecting pollinator-mediated competition between native
   and non-native plants in urban habitats. However, non-native species
   together with managed vegetation may have powerful effects in urban
   habitats via changes in community-level plant phenology and consequent
   changes in pollinator phenology.
   5. The current level of climate warming has not caused plants and
   pollinators to become detectably temporally separated, although at the
   same time, diversity among species' phenological responses could buffer
   plant-pollinator interactions from climate variation. Due to the urban
   warming effect, cities provide a promising system for better
   understanding the warming effects on plant-pollinator interactions.
   6. Environmental contaminants such as soil nitrogen and heavy metal
   pollution have been examined with respect to plant-pollinator
   interactions in small-scale, mechanistic studies. The extent to which
   environmental contaminants drive plant-pollinator interactions in actual

Abstract = {{Wildlife-friendly gardening practices can help conserve biodiversity in
   urban areas. These include growing ornamental plant varieties attractive
   to flower-visiting insects. Because varieties vary greatly in
   attractiveness, there is a need to quantify it in order to give
   objective advice to gardeners. Here, we used the British national
   collection of asters to compare the attractiveness of varieties to
   flower-visiting insects. We counted and identified insects as they
   foraged on flowers in 228 varieties growing in discrete patches that
   flowered during the survey period, 14 September-20 October 2012. In each
   variety, we also determined the overall capitulum size, the central disc
   floret area, and the ray floret color (blue, red, purple, or white). We
   also scored attributes relevant to gardening: attractiveness to humans,
   ease of cultivation, and availability in the United Kingdom. There was
   great variation among varieties in their attractiveness to insects,
   ranging from 0.0 to 15.2 per count per square meter, and highly skewed,
   with most being unattractive. A similar skew held for the two main
   insect categories, honey bees and hover flies, which comprised 28 and
   64\% of all insects, respectively. None of the floral traits or
   attributes relevant to gardening correlated significantly with
   attractiveness to insects. Our study shows the practicality of using a
   national collection for quantifying and comparing the attractiveness of
   ornamental varieties to flower-visiting insects. These results imply
   that choosing varieties carefully is likely to be of conservation
   benefit to flower-visiting insects, and that doing so is a no-cost
   option in terms of garden beauty and workload.}},

Abstract = {{Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) is a crop with perfect flowers capable
   of self-pollination. Insect pollination enhances fruit set, but little
   is known about how pollination success varies by number of visits from
   bumble bees. To quantify the efficiency of bumble bees at pollinating
   eggplants, we allowed 1, 2, 6, and 12 bumble bees (Bombus impatiens
   Cresson) to visit eggplant flowers and compared percentage of flowers
   that set fruit, fruit weight, and seed set after 3 wk. We compared yield
   from these visit numbers to eggplant flowers that were left open for
   unlimited visitation. Eggplant flowers set the most fruit from
   open-pollination and 12 visits. Larger, seedier fruits were formed in
   open-pollinated flowers. However, fruit characteristics in the 12 visit
   treatment were similar to lower visitation frequencies. We confirm B.
   impatiens as an efficient eggplant pollinator and document the greatest
   benefit from 12 bumble bee visits and open-pollinated flowers. To
   maintain effective eggplant pollination, local conditions must be
   conducive for bumble bee colony establishment and repeated pollen
   foraging trips.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity is changing at unprecedented rates, and it is increasingly
   important that these changes are quantified through monitoring
   programmes. Previous recommendations for developing or enhancing these
   programmes focus either on the end goals, that is the intended use of
   the data, or on how these goals are achieved, for example through
   volunteer involvement in citizen science, but not both. These
   recommendations are rarely prioritized. We used a collaborative
   approach, involving 52 experts in biodiversity monitoring in the UK, to
   develop a list of attributes of relevance to any biodiversity monitoring
   programme and to order these attributes by their priority. We also
   ranked the attributes according to their importance in monitoring
   biodiversity in the UK. Experts involved included data users, funders,
   programme organizers and participants in data collection. They covered
   expertise in a wide range of taxa. We developed a final list of 25
   attributes of biodiversity monitoring schemes, ordered from the most
   elemental (those essential for monitoring schemes; e.g. articulate the
   objectives and gain sufficient participants) to the most aspirational
   (e.g. electronic data capture in the field, reporting change annually).
   This ordered list is a practical framework which can be used to support
   the development of monitoring programmes. People's ranking of attributes
   revealed a difference between those who considered attributes with
   benefits to end users to be most important (e.g. people from
   governmental organizations) and those who considered attributes with
   greatest benefit to participants to be most important (e.g. people
   involved with volunteer biological recording schemes). This reveals a
   distinction between focussing on aims and the pragmatism in achieving
   those aims.Synthesis and applications. The ordered list of attributes
   developed in this study will assist in prioritizing resources to develop
   biodiversity monitoring programmes (including citizen science). The
   potential conflict between end users of data and participants in data
   collection that we discovered should be addressed by involving the
   diversity of stakeholders at all stages of programme development. This
   will maximize the chance of successfully achieving the goals of
   biodiversity monitoring programmes.

Abstract = {{This study explored the pathways of ingress of Acidovorax citrulli, the
   causal agent of bacterial fruit blotch of cucurbits, into watermelon
   seeds. Up until 7days post-inoculation (DPI), a significantly higher
   percentage of watermelon seeds was infected with A.citrulli when the
   bacteria were applied (c. 1x10(6)colony-forming units) to stigmas versus
   ovary pericarps of female flowers. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed
   that, with stigma inoculation, A.citrulli colonized style and ovary
   tissues by 1 DPI, and the bacteria co-localized with pollen germ tubes
   in these tissues. With ovary pericarp inoculation, A.citrulli cells
   penetrated the epicarp and mesocarp tissues by 1 DPI but did not reach
   endocarp until 4 DPI. Finally, manual pollination followed by stigma
   inoculation led to >53\% A.citrulli-infected seed lots, while A.citrulli
   was not detected in seeds/ovules generated by stigma inoculation without
   pollination (chemically induced parthenocarpy). These results show that
   stigma inoculation results in faster colonization of watermelon ovules
   by A.citrulli than pericarp inoculation, even though there is no
   difference in the levels of infection in mature seeds. The data also
   indicate that pollen germ tubes play an important role in A.citrulli
   ingress into watermelon seeds via stigmas.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous bee species were collected from a single green roof over the
   blooming period of the dominant exotic plant type, Sedum, a succulent
   stonecrop widely used in the green roof industry. As green roofs become
   more common in cities, an understanding of the potential positive and
   negative impacts of widespread use of this exotic but useful plant is
   needed. In this study we sampled bees visiting a green roof in downtown
   Toronto and compared the proportion of Sedum pollen in the loads they
   were carrying back to nesting locations. It was found that smaller bees
   (e.g. Lasioglossum, Hylaeus) were significantly less common on the roof
   compared with medium (e.g. Apis, Megachile) and large-sized bees (e.g.
   Bombus, Andrena). The proportion of Sedum pollen in the pollen loads of
   foraging bees collected was high amongst all bees (average of 80.5 \% of
   total pollen load), but significantly greater for exotic bees compared
   to native bees. Moreover, native bees had significantly greater numbers
   of non-Sedum pollen types comprising more than > 20 \% of their pollen
   loads, meaning bees could be visiting flowers at ground level and on the
   roof in the same foraging bout. As the number of green roofs in cities
   increase, the characteristics of their designs, including the vegetation
   type and diversity, could have a significant impact in shaping local
   urban bee communities.}},

Abstract = {{The apparent reduction of solitary and primitively eusocial bees
   populations has remained a huge concern over the past few decades and
   urbanisation is considered as one of the factors affecting bees at

   settings. We investigated the urban core of a British town for diversity
   and abundance of solitary bees using standardized methods, and compared
   the results with nearby meadows and nature reserves. The study recorded
   48 species within the town, about 22 \% of the total species and 58 \%
   of the genera of solitary bees in the United Kingdom. Furthermore we
   found the urban core to be more diverse and abundant in solitary and
   primitively eusocial bees compared to the meadows and nature reserves.
   Of particular note was an urban record of the nationally rare Red Data
   Book species Coelioxys quadridentata and its host Anthophora
   quadrimaculata. This research demonstrates that urban settings can
   contribute significantly to the conservation of solitary and primitively
   eusocial bees in Britain.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization is increasing worldwide. Urban habitats often support
   considerable biodiversity and so are of conservation value, even though
   they are highly modified ecosystems. Urban parks and gardens are rich in
   flowers that provide food for pollinators, including bees. Here, we use
   waggle dance decoding to investigate foraging by 3 honey bee hives
   located in the city of Brighton, UK, over almost an entire foraging
   season, April to October. Waggle dances were recorded using video
   cameras and decoded during framewise playback on a computer by measuring
   the angle and duration of the waggle phase. Foraging was mostly local
   (mean monthly distances 0.5-1.2 km) and mostly within the surrounding
   urban area (monthly means 78-92 \%) versus the countryside (closest
   distance 2.2 km) even though this was well within the honey bee maximum
   foraging range (c. 12 km). These distances were lower than those from a
   previous study for hives located in a rural area 4.5 km away. Honey bees
   are very sensitive to foraging economics and foragers make waggle dances
   only after visiting high-quality feeding locations. Low distances
   advertised by dances, therefore, indicate sufficient forage nearby and
   show that urban areas can support honey bees year round. As a corollary,
   however, urban bees may provide little pollination service to
   agriculture especially in spring, which had the lowest foraging
   distances and is when the most economically important animal-pollinated
   UK crops, apple and oilseed rape, are in bloom.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty-two honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies were studied in order to
   detect and measure potential in vivo effects of neonicotinoid pesticides
   used in cornfields (Zea mays spp) on honeybee health. Honeybee colonies
   were randomly split on four different agricultural cornfield areas
   located near Quebec City, Canada. Two locations contained cornfields
   treated with a seed-coated systemic neonicotinoid insecticide while the
   two others were organic cornfields used as control treatments. Hives
   were extensively monitored for their performance and health traits over
   a period of two years. Honeybee viruses (brood queen cell virus BQCV,
   deformed wing virus DWV, and Israeli acute paralysis virus IAPV) and the
   brain specific expression of a biomarker of host physiological stress,
   the Acetylcholinesterase gene AChE, were investigated using RT-qPCR.
   Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed to detect
   pesticide residues in adult bees, honey, pollen, and corn flowers
   collected from the studied hives in each location. In addition, general
   hive conditions were assessed by monitoring colony weight and brood
   development. Neonicotinoids were only identified in corn flowers at low
   concentrations. However, honeybee colonies located in neonicotinoid
   treated cornfields expressed significantly higher pathogen infection
   than those located in untreated cornfields. AChE levels showed elevated
   levels among honeybees that collected corn pollen from treated fields.
   Positive correlations were recorded between pathogens and the treated
   locations. Our data suggests that neonicotinoids indirectly weaken
   honeybee health by inducing physiological stress and increasing pathogen
   loads.}},

Title = {{Nest Suitability, Fine-Scale Population Structure and Male-Mediated
   Dispersal of a Solitary Ground Nesting Bee in an Urban Landscape}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Bees are the primary pollinators of flowering plants in almost all
   ecosystems. Worldwide declines in bee populations have raised awareness
   about the importance of their ecological role in maintaining ecosystem
   functioning. The naturally strong philopatric behavior that some bee
   species show can be detrimental to population viability through
   increased probability of inbreeding. Furthermore, bee populations found
   in human-altered landscapes, such as urban areas, can experience lower
   levels of gene flow and effective population sizes, increasing potential
   for inbreeding depression in wild bee populations. In this study, we
   investigated the fine-scale population structure of the solitary bee
   Colletes inaequalis in an urbanized landscape. First, we developed a
   predictive spatial model to detect suitable nesting habitat for this
   ground nesting bee and to inform our field search for nests. We
   genotyped 18 microsatellites in 548 female individuals collected from
   nest aggregations throughout the study area. Genetic relatedness
   estimates revealed that genetic similarity among individuals was
   slightly greater within nest aggregations than among randomly chosen
   individuals. However, genetic structure among nest aggregations was low
   (Nei's G(ST) = 0.011). Reconstruction of parental genotypes revealed
   greater genetic relatedness among females than among males within nest
   aggregations, suggesting male-mediated dispersal as a potentially
   important mechanism of population connectivity and inbreeding avoidance.
   Size of nesting patch was positively correlated with effective
   population size, but not with other estimators of genetic diversity. We
   detected a positive trend between geographic distance and genetic
   differentiation between nest aggregations. Our landscape genetic models
   suggest that increased urbanization is likely associated with higher
   levels of inbreeding. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance
   of density and distribution of suitable nesting patches for enhancing
   bee population abundance and connectivity in human dominated habitats
   and highlights the critical contribution of landscape genetic studies
   for enhanced conservation and management of native pollinators.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{Pollen is one of the primary causes of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in
   urban centers. In the present study, the concentrations of 39 different
   pollens in the Santiago de Chile metropolitan area over the period
   2009-2013 are characterized. The pollen was monitored daily using
   Burkard volumetric equipment. The contribution of each type of pollen
   and the corresponding time trends are evaluated. The concentrations of
   the pollens are compared with the established threshold levels for the
   protection of human health. The results show that the total amount of
   pollen grains originating from trees, grasses, weeds and indeterminate
   sources throughout the period of the study was 258,496 grains m-3, with
   an annual average of 51,699 +/- 3,906 grains m-3 year-1. The primary
   source of pollen is Platanus orientalis, which produces 61.8\% of the
   analyzed pollen. Grass pollen is the third primary component of the
   analyzed pollen, with a contribution of 5.82\%. Among the weeds, the
   presence of Urticacea (3.74\%) is remarkable. The pollination pattern of
   the trees is monophasic, and the grasses have a biphasic pattern. The
   trends indicate that the total pollen and tree pollen do not present a
   time trend that is statistically significant throughout the period of
   the study, whereas the grass pollen and weed pollen concentrations in
   the environment present a statistically significant decreasing trend.
   The cause of this decrease is unclear. The pollen load has doubled over
   the past decade. When the observed concentrations of the pollens were
   compared with the corresponding threshold levels, the results indicated
   that over the period of the study, the pollen concentrations were at
   moderate, high and very high levels for an average of 293 days per year.
   Systematic counts of the pollen grains are an essential method for
   diagnosing and treating patients with pollinosis and for developing
   forestation and urban planning strategies.}},

   escape from herbivory. We hypothesized that post-anthesis prostrate
   scapes in Taraxacum is an adaptation for avoidance of capitulum grazing
   by large herbivores. To test this hypothesis, we divided flowering into
   the following four stages based on the external appearance of the
   capitulum: green bud, yellow corolla, brown corolla, and white pappus
   stages. We conducted an experiment in natural pasture in Mongolia to
   artificially raise capitula and rosette leaves of T. collinum. We
   measured the natural height of capitula and rosette leaves of the
   Mongolian pasture and urban species, T. collinum and T. ceratophorum,
   respectively, and of the Japanese rural and exotic urban species, T.
   japonicum and T. officinale, respectively. We investigated natural
   grazing by livestock in the field of the capitula and rosette leaves of
   the two Mongolian species. In Mongolia, naturally short capitula at the
   green bud and brown corolla stages and rosette leaves of T. collinum
   were not grazed. However, artificially raised capitula and rosette
   leaves of T. collinum and the naturally high capitula and leaves of T.
   ceratophorum were grazed. Short capitulum and leaf height was shown to
   be effective for avoidance of livestock grazing in Mongolia. In Japan,
   T. japonicum and T. officinale showed similar scape behavior to T.
   collinum and T. ceratophorum, respectively. We discuss the reasons for
   the capitulum behavior differences in Japan.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological studies lasting more than 1 or 2 years are not particularly
   common anywhere and in any taxonomic group. Ecological studies in orchid
   bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are not an exception and have focused on
   short-term scale. Long-term studies have been mostly neglected up to
   date. Orchid-bee males were attracted to five different scent baits in
   the same site every other year during a seven-year span, from 1997 to
   2004, in an urban forest remnant, totaling four full years of samplings
   in between. In total, we captured 2188 bees from 14 species. Species
   diversity, evenness, and richness remained remarkably stable among
   years. The stability index, sensu Wolda, for the composite community
   revealed to be one of the highest ever recorded for insect communities.
   Our results suggest that orchid-bee populations may remain remarkably
   stable over the years even in a small (a parts per thousand 200 ha) area
   immersed in a metropolitan (a parts per thousand 3,000,000 inhabitants)
   matrix and that these urban areas should not be neglected in
   conservation efforts, since they seem to maintain viable populations of
   these important pollinators over time.}},

Abstract = {{Urban landscapes are spatially constrained, and vegetative land uses
   that provide beneficial ecosystem services are difficult to maintain.
   Urban agricultural (UA) systems appear in many forms - from community
   farms and rooftop gardens to edible landscaping and urban orchards - and
   can be productive features of cities and provide important environmental
   services. As highly managed plant communities, UA can exhibit high
   levels of biodiversity, often exceeding that of other green space areas
   within the city. Additionally, it is likely that variation in vegetation
   cover, diversity, and structure influence not only the biodiversity in
   UA, but also the quantity and quality of ecosystem services supported by
   such systems. The biodiversity and ecosystem services (B\&ES) of UA can
   have potentially large societal and environmental benefits for cities,
   such as enhanced food security, air quality, and water regulation. Yet
   few studies have synthesized knowledge regarding UA vegetation
   management impacts on the quantity, quality, and stability of B\&ES
   provided. This article presents the first survey of the existing
   research on the characteristics of UA management and their potential to
   support ecosystem service delivery. Specifically, we examine: (1)
   biodiversity patterns in UA, (2) ecosystem services provided by UA, and
   (3) the challenges of promoting UA systems that support B\&ES. Overall,
   our review reveals that varied vegetative structure, increased native
   plant diversity, and reduction of urban impervious surface are key
   features of UA systems that contribute significantly to urban
   biodiversity and provide important ecosystem services such as
   pollination, pest control, and climate resilience. We conclude with a
   discussion of critical gaps in current research and strategies to better
   understand and support UA and ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive biology in the highly diverse Cactaceae family is described
   in only few species. Given that a large number of species are rare,
   threatened, or endangered, and the entire family is included in Appendix
   II of CITES, the limited knowledge about their reproductive biology is
   of major concern. Mammiliaria pectimfera is an endangered, small,
   globose cactus endemic to the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan region in Central
   Mexico. We aimed to characterize some basic aspects of its reproductive
   biology in three populations. We described flower morphology and
   anthesis, identified floral visitors, and evaluated the occurrence of
   spontaneous self-fertilization and the success of open pollination.
   Diurnal anthesis in flowers lasted about 4 h/day and almost all flowers
   lasted only one day after opening. The analyses of variance revealed
   differences in flower morphology among populations. Herkogamy was
   positive and significantly different among populations. Field
   experiments revealed that open-pollinated flowers were highly successful
   in setting fruits and seeds. These results corroborate those reported in
   other Mammillaria species. Autonomous self-pollination was negligible
   and ineffective. Bees of the genus Ceratina were dominant among the
   captured flower visitors, and estimations of their maximum foraging
   distance indicated successful outcrossing in plants. This study
   indicates almost complete dependency of M. pectinifera on pollinators
   for fruits and seeds production. Our results serve as a basis for future
   research on reproductive biology of M. pectinifera and other rare and
   endangered cacti. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoid insecticides used to treat the seeds of bee-attractive
   crops occur in trace amounts in nectar and pollen. Possible harm to bees
   has resulted in the European Commission imposing a precautionary
   two-year moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids on bee-attractive crops
   from 2013. Recent laboratory and semi-field studies on colony-level
   effects of neonicotinoids assumed exclusive or near-exclusive levels of
   colony foraging on a treated crop. But is this a realistic assumption?
   Six honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies were monitored over two springs
   (April-May 2011/12) in two neighbouring locations (urban and rural) in
   and near Brighton, UK, to quantify foraging on oilseed rape, the most
   widespread beeattractive crop in the UK, by decoding waggle dances and
   trapping pollen. The study area was representative of the UK
   agricultural landscape in that the percentage area cover of the blooming
   oilseed rape fields around the rural location was similar to the
   national average (3.3-3.9\% vs 3.1\%). The amount of foraging on oilseed
   rape fields, as indicated by dance decoding, was variable, but low,
   0-0.02\% for the urban and 2-26\% for the rural location. Almost all
   foraging, 91-99\%, was within 2 km, even though honey bees can forage at
   distances of over 10 km. Pollen trapping in 2012 supported the dance
   decoding results, with oilseed rape pollen comprising 14\% of pollen
   pellets collected by foragers from rural and 4\% from urban hives. The
   results of this study have implications for policy as they cast doubt on
   the generality of some previous studies on colony-level effects on
   social bees conducted in laboratory and semi-field settings. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Isolation mechanisms that prevent gene flow between populations
   prezygotically play important roles in achieving speciation. In
   flowering plants, the nighttime flowering system provides a mechanism
   for isolation from diurnally flowering species. Although this system has
   long been of interest in evolutionary biology, the evolutionary process
   leading to this system has yet to be elucidated because of the lack of
   good model species. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying the
   differences in flowering times and the traits that attract pollinators
   between a pair of diurnally and nocturnally flowering species have
   recently been identified in a few cases. This identification enables us
   to build a realistic model for theoretically studying the evolution of a
   nocturnally flowering species. In this study, based on previous
   experimental data, we assumed a model in which two loci control the
   flowering time and one locus determines a trait that attracts
   pollinators. Using this model, we evaluated the possibility of the
   evolution of a nocturnally flowering species from a diurnally flowering
   ancestor through simulations. We found that a newly emerging nighttime
   flowering flower exhibited a sufficiently high fitness, and the
   evolution of a nocturnally flowering species from a diurnally flowering
   species could be achieved when hybrid viability was intermediate to low,
   even in a completely sympatric situation. Our results suggest that the
   difference in flowering time can act as a magic trait that induces both
   natural selection and assortative mating and would play an important
   role in speciation between diurnally and nocturnally flowering species
   pairs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   (Ctenanthidium) bifasciata (Urban, 1993) based on specimens reared from
   a trap nest along with a female. This species, originally known only
   from the type specimen collected in Colonia, Uruguay, is also newly
   recorded from Buenos Aires, Argentina. We provide for the first time
   information on the nest structure and, based on the analysis of pollen
   grains from brood cells, record five host plant species belonging to the
   families Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, and Fabaceae. Most pollen
   grains belong to an undetermined species of the genus Melilotus L.

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to investigate the seed formation potential by
   the evaluation of microspore development and self- and
   cross-compatibility through their pollen tube growth response to self
   and cross pollination in Jeju old local citrus species. Anther and
   pollen histological analyses were done to observe microspore development
   for three species including byungkyul, sadoogam, and dangyooza. Pollens
   of ten citrus species were tested for pollen viability by staining with
   Lugol's solution and fluorescein diacetate. Flowers of all species were
   emasculated and self- and cross-pollinated just before anthesis. Pistils
   of nine pollinating combinations between the listed three species were
   collected at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days after pollination for evaluation of
   a growth pattern of the pollen tube. Pistils of the other combinations
   were collected at 9 days after pollination for self- and
   cross-compatibility evaluation. Pistils were prepared by squashing and
   staining method with aniline blue. Eight pollen developmental stages
   were recognized and indicated normal development of microspore. These
   ten citrus species produced high percentage of viable pollens. Pollen
   tube behavior in compatible and incompatible pollination was
   distinguished. Pollen tube performance was largely depended on
   male-female combination. All of these Jeju old local citrus species were
   male fertile and have the ability to produce enough viable pollens for
   self- and cross-pollination. All evaluated citrus species were self- and
   cross-compatible to each other except dangyooza which was
   self-incompatible.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims The S-locus receptor kinase (SRK), which is
   expressed in stigma epidermal cells, is responsible for the recognition
   and inhibition of `self' pollen in the self-incompatibility (SI)
   response of the Brassicaceae. The allele-specific interaction of SRK
   with its cognate pollen coat-localized ligand, the S-locus cysteine-rich
   (SCR) protein, is thought to trigger a signalling cascade within the
   stigma epidermal cell that leads to the arrest of `self' pollen at the
   stigma surface. In addition to the full-length signalling SRK receptor,
   stigma epidermal cells express two other SRK protein species that lack
   the kinase domain and whose role in the SI response is not understood: a
   soluble version of the SRK ectodomain designated eSRK and a
   membrane-tethered form designated tSRK. The goal of this study was to
   describe the sub-cellular distribution of the various SRK protein
   species in stigma epidermal cells as a prelude to visualizing receptor
   dynamics in response to SCR binding.
   Methods The Arabidopsis lyrata SRKb variant was tagged with the Citrine
   variant of yellow fluorescent protein (cYFP) and expressed in A.
   thaliana plants of the C24 accession, which had been shown to exhibit a
   robust SI response upon transformation with the SRKb-SCRb gene pair. The
   transgenes used in this study were designed for differential production
   and visualization of the three SRK protein species in stigma epidermal
   cells. Transgenic stigmas were analysed by pollination assays and
   confocal microscopy.
   Key Results and Conclusions Pollination assays demonstrated that the
   cYFP-tagged SRK proteins are functional and that the eSRK is not
   required for SI. Confocal microscopic analysis of cYFP-tagged SRK
   proteins in live stigma epidermal cells revealed the differential
   sub-cellular localization of the three SRK protein species but showed no
   evidence for redistribution of these proteins subsequent to incompatible
   pollination.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystem services (ES) have been broadly adopted as a conceptual
   framing for addressing human nature interactions and to illustrate the
   ways in which humans depend on ecosystems for sustained life and
   well-being. Additionally, ES are being increasingly included in urban
   planning and management as a way to create multi-functional landscapes
   able to meet the needs of expanding urban populations. However, while ES
   are generated and utilized within landscapes we still have limited
   understanding of the relationship between ES and spatial structure and
   dynamics. Here, we offer an expanded conceptualization of these
   relationships through the concept of service providing units (SPUs) as a
   way to plan and manage the structures and preconditions that are needed
   for, and in different ways influence, provisioning of ES. The SPU
   approach has two parts: the first deals with internal dimensions of the
   SPUs themselves, i.e, spatial and temporal scale and organizational
   level, and the second outlines how context and presence of external
   structures (e.g, built infrastructure or larger ecosystems) affect the
   performance of SPUs. In doing so, SPUs enable a more nuanced and
   comprehensive approach to managing and designing multi-functional
   landscapes and achieving multiple ES goals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Several studies have found high levels of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and
   lead (Pb) in honey bee hives located near urbanized or industrial areas.
   Insect herbivores and pollinators may come in contact with environmental
   contaminants in the leaves and flowers they forage upon in these areas.
   Our study quantified which of these metals are accumulated in the
   tissues of a common weedy plant that can serve as a route of exposure
   for insects. We grew Raphanus sativus (crop radish) in semi-hydroponic
   sand culture in the greenhouse. Plants were irrigated with nutrient
   solutions containing Cd, Cu, or Pb at four concentrations (control, low,
   medium, high). Plant performance, floral traits, and metal accumulation
   were measured in various vegetative and reproductive plant organs.
   Floral traits and flower number were unaffected by all metal treatments.
   Copper accumulated at the highest concentrations in flowers compared to
   the other two metals. Copper and Cd had the highest translocation
   indices, as well as higher bioconcentration factors compared to Pb,
   which was mostly immobile in the plant. Copper posed the highest risk
   due to its high mobility within the plant. In particular, accumulation
   of metals in leaves and flowers suggests that herbivores and pollinators
   visiting and foraging on these tissues may be exposed to these
   potentially toxic compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen deposition, a surrogate for bee efficiency, becomes increasingly
   important during their interspecific interactions. We conducted field
   experiments on highly cross-pollinated melon (Cucumis melo) and
   watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) in order to understand how bee species
   with different pollination efficiencies displace each other from floral
   resources. We observed significant displacement of less abundant but
   more efficient bees by the more abundant but less efficient bees in both
   crops, which may lead to deficient pollination. We did not find
   significant relationship of the bee displacement success and body size
   or abundance. Apis florea (Fabricius) and Nomia sp.2 (Latreille) had
   significantly more winner events in melon, while the former also had
   significantly more winner events in watermelon. A. florea was the only
   bee species that foraged mostly within the 1-m(2) virtual area after
   their displacement, which may indicate its behavior of geitinogamous
   pollination. The two bee species, Ceratina sexmaculata (Smith) and
   Lasioglossum sp. (Curtis), were more sensitive to displacement as their
   proportion of leaving the 1-m(2) virtual area was higher.}},

   experiment}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The causes of bee declines remain hotly debated, particularly the
   contribution of neonicotinoid insecticides. In 2013 the UK's Food \&
   Environment Research Agency made public a study of the impacts of
   exposure of bumblebee colonies to neonicotinoids. The study concluded
   that there was no clear relationship between colony performance and
   pesticide exposure, and the study was subsequently cited by the UK
   government in a policy paper in support of their vote against a proposed
   moratorium on some uses of neonicotinoids. Here I present a simple
   re-analysis of this data set. It demonstrates that these data in fact do
   show a negative relationship between both colony growth and queen
   production and the levels of neonicotinoids in the food stores collected
   by the bees. Indeed, this is the first study describing substantial
   negative impacts of neonicotinoids on colony performance of any bee
   species with free-flying bees in a field realistic situation where
   pesticide exposure is provided only as part of normal farming practices.
   It strongly suggests that wild bumblebee colonies in farmland can be
   expected to be adversely affected by exposure to neonicotinoids.}},

Abstract = {{Insect pollinators provide a crucial ecosystem service, but are under
   threat. Urban areas could be important for pollinators, though their
   value relative to other habitats is poorly known. We compared pollinator
   communities using quantified flower-visitation networks in 36 sites
   (each 1 km(2)) in three landscapes: urban, farmland and nature reserves.
   Overall, flower-visitor abundance and species richness did not differ
   significantly between the three landscape types. Bee abundance did not
   differ between landscapes, but bee species richness was higher in urban
   areas than farmland. Hoverfly abundance was higher in farmland and
   nature reserves than urban sites, but species richness did not differ
   significantly. While urban pollinator assemblages were more homogeneous
   across space than those in farmland or nature reserves, there was no
   significant difference in the numbers of rarer species between the three
   landscapes. Network-level specialization was higher in farmland than
   urban sites. Relative to other habitats, urban visitors foraged from a
   greater number of plant species (higher generality) but also visited a
   lower proportion of available plant species (higher specialization),
   both possibly driven by higher urban plant richness. Urban areas are
   growing, and improving their value for pollinators should be part of any
   national strategy to conserve and restore pollinators.}},

Title = {{Honey bee success predicted by landscape composition in Ohio, USA}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{Foraging honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) can routinely travel as far as
   several kilometers from their hive in the process of collecting nectar
   and pollen from floral patches within the surrounding landscape. Since
   the availability of floral resources at the landscape scale is a
   function of landscape composition, apiculturists have long recognized
   that landscape composition is a critical determinant of honey bee colony
   success. Nevertheless, very few studies present quantitative data
   relating colony success metrics to local landscape composition. We
   employed a beekeeper survey in conjunction with GIS-based landscape
   analysis to model colony success as a function of landscape composition
   in the State of Ohio, USA, a region characterized by intensive cropland,
   urban development, deciduous forest, and grassland. We found that colony
   food accumulation and wax production were positively related to cropland
   and negatively related to forest and grassland, a pattern that may be
   driven by the abundance of dandelion and clovers in agricultural areas
   compared to forest or mature grassland. Colony food accumulation was
   also negatively correlated with urban land cover in sites dominated by
   urban and agricultural land use, which does not support the popular
   opinion that the urban environment is more favorable to honey bees than
   cropland.}},

   This study evaluated the polyembryony and estimated the optimal sample

   embryo number and polyembryony rate, respectively. Fruits and seeds were
   collected from mother plants in the experimental field of Embrapa Manioc
   and Fruitculture, in Cruz das Almas, state of Bahia, Brazil. Rootstock
   species evaluated were: `Sunki Tropical', `Sunki Maravilha', `Sunki da

   Jambhiri', `Rugoso da Florida', `Rugoso Comum' and `Volkameriano Lagoa

   lime x `Sunki Maravilha' mandarin, `Sunki da Florida' mandarin x
   citrangequat `Thomasville' and an open pollinated hybrid of `Tahiti'
   lime. Data was submitted to descriptive analysis and equations of
   maximum curvature were estimated for determination of fruit and seed
   sample optimal size using 20 or 100 fruits and 156 seeds per genotype,
   respectively. Seed production and polyembryony varied significantly
   among the genotypes, which could be grouped by seed production and by
   polyembryony rate in five classes, respectively comprising intervals of
   2 to 28 seeds and 12 to 100\%. Optimal size sample was respectively of
   nine uniform fruits, ten and 23 seeds to determine fruit seed mean
   number, seed embryo mean number and polyembryony rate by direct
   counting, because these sample levels were sufficient for all genotypes
   evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Citrus is a genus with gametophytic self-incompatibility, which prevents
   fertilization by self-pollination. Polyamines (PAs), as a class of
   active small molecules, widely participate in various cellular
   activities. To investigate the effects of the changes in PA contents
   lputrescine, spermidine (SPD), and sperminel on pollen tube growth in
   self-incompatible (SI) plants, we cultured pollen of Citrus maxima
   `Banpeiyu' and C. tamurana `Hyuganatsu' in a Citrus mature pollen
   culture system and detected the PA content changes in pollen by
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis during
   germination and after treatment with crude protein extracts of
   compatible or incompatible styles. We profiled the PA content changes
   during the germination course in pollen of `Banpeiyu' and `Hyuganatsu'
   by HPLC, and identified increases of free and perchloric-acid-insoluble
   SPD contents in pollen tubes in the incompatible treatment. Exogenous
   SPD treatment obviously increased the SPD contents in the pollen tube,
   inhibited pollen tube elongation, and resulted in some abnormal
   morphological alterations, such as tip inflation, tube content leakage
   and tip twist, which were observed in both `Banpeiyu' and `Hyuganatsu'
   pollen tubes exposed to incompatible treatment. This finding implied
   that SPD might participate in the SI response in Citrus.}},

Abstract = {{Fig trees are important elements of tropical forests, but some species
   can become invasive. This is the case with Ficus microcarpa, which is
   native to the Philippines but invasive in some parts of the world. The
   fig wasp community of F. microcarpa in the Philippines can be used as a
   means of curbing this invasiveness and we aimed to describe this
   community. In the University of the Philippines Diliman campus, the wasp
   community was composed of three fig wasp species: the pollinator
   Eupristina verticillata and two non-pollinator species: a non-primary
   galler, Sycoryctes moneres and a seed predator, Philotrypesis
   taiwanensis. Using sticky traps, we showed that F. microcarpa figs are
   receptive to pollinators for only 1-2 d. The non-pollinating S. moneres
   and P. taiwanensis wasps arrived 7-10 d after the peak arrival of
   pollinators. This is the first documentation of the arrival time of a
   fig wasp seed predator. Through wasp introduction experiments, we were
   also able to characterize the trophic structure of this community.
   Nonetheless, the presence of S. moneres did not lead to a significant
   decrease in pollinator numbers. Introduction of this species to sites
   with invasive F. microcarpa trees may therefore not be an effective
   biocontrol method.}},

Abstract = {{Seagrasses are a diverse group of clonal marine macrophytes. Their
   disappearance in recent decades has been an alarming component of
   estuarine urbanization, effectively transitioning vast portions of
   global coverage to disturbed or recovering states. Understanding
   dispersal and recruitment patterns within and among extant populations
   is now vitally important to predicting both the form and pace of
   recovery. Working with a perennial ecotype of Zostera marina within a
   shallow lagoon in Long Island, New York, U.S.A., we combined high
   resolution, decade-long seagrass mapping with polymorphic microsatellite
   analysis to examine the interactive effects of pollination and seed
   dispersal distance on the dynamics of sexual recruitment across a range
   of spatial scales (centimeters to decameters). We found clone structure
   to be restricted to less than three meter across a 56,250-m(2) study
   site. Pollination distances ranged from 0.57 m to 73.91 m, while seed
   dispersal varied systematically from 1.85 m to 5.31 m for naked seeds,
   and randomly throughout the study site (0.17 m to 34.54 m) for seeds
   deposited by floating reproductive shoots. Pedigree analyses
   corroborated these findings, with full sibling groups clustering neatly
   within larger half-sibling kinships at spatial scales of 2-6 m. We
   successfully demonstrate that over a four-year period sexual
   reproduction and seedling recruitment played appreciable roles in the
   colonizing process of Z. marina, configuring the landscape through the
   deposition of rafted seeds, and contributing to patch expansion via the
   limited dispersal of naked seeds.}},

Abstract = {{Much of the world's terrestrial landscapes are being altered by humans
   in the form of agriculture, urbanization and pastoral systems, with
   major implications for biodiversity. Bumble bees are one of the most
   effective pollinators in both natural and cultivated landscapes, but are
   often the first to be extirpated in human-altered habitats. Yet, little
   is known about the role of natural and human-altered habitats in
   promoting or limiting bumble bee gene flow. In this study, I closely
   examine the genetic structure of the yellow-faced bumble bee,
   Bombusvosnesenskii, across the southwestern US coast and find strong
   evidence that natural oceanic barriers, as well as contemporary
   human-altered habitats, limit bee gene flow. Heterozygosity and allelic
   richness were lower in island populations, while private allelic
   richness was higher in island populations compared to mainland
   populations. Genetic differentiation, measured for three indices across
   the 1000km study region, was significantly greater than the null
   expectation (F-ST=0.041, F'(ST)=0.044 and D-est=0.155) and correlated
   with geographic distance. Furthermore, genetic differentiation patterns
   were most strongly correlated with contemporary (2011) not past (2006,
   2001) resistance maps calibrated for high dispersal limitation over
   oceans, impervious habitat and croplands. Despite the incorporation of
   dramatic elevation gradients, the analyses reveal that oceans and
   contemporary human land use, not mountains, are the primary dispersal
   barriers for B.vosnesenskii gene flow. These findings reinforce the
   importance of maintaining corridors of suitable habitat across the
   distribution range of native pollinators to promote their persistence
   and safeguard their ability to provide essential pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{The honey bee, the world's most important agricultural pollinator,
   relies exclusively on plant-derived foods for nutrition. Nectar and
   pollen collected by honey bees are processed and matured within the nest
   through the activities of honey bee-derived microbes and enzymes. In
   order to better understand the contribution of the microbial community
   to food processing in the honey bee, we generated a metatranscriptome of
   the honey bee gut microbiome. The function of the microbial community in
   the honey bee, as revealed by metatranscriptome sequencing, resembles
   that of other animal guts and food-processing environments. We
   identified three major bacterial classes that are active in the gut
   (-Proteobacteria, Bacilli and Actinobacteria), all of which are
   predicted to participate in the breakdown of complex macromolecules
   (e.g. polysaccharides and polypeptides), the fermentation of component
   parts of these macromolecules, and the generation of various
   fermentation products, such as short-chain fatty acids and alcohol. The
   ability of the microbial community to metabolize these carbon-rich food
   sources was confirmed through the use of community-level physiological
   profiling. Collectively, these findings suggest that the gut microflora
   of the honey bee harbours bacterial members with unique roles, which
   ultimately can contribute to the processing of plant-derived food for
   colonies.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of reduced mowing on wildflower bloom and
   flower-visiting insects in the Saltdean Oval, a 6ha suburban public park
   in Saltdean, UK. In 2012, a novel management regime was initiated in
   which approximately half the grass area was left uncut, with the plan
   being to mow it once per year in autumn. In spring 2013, we set up four
   blocks, with each block subdivided into four 30x5m strips treated under
   different mowing regimes: (a) regular mowing every 2weeks all spring and
   summer, (b) regular mowing until 2 June, (c) regular mowing until 5
   July, and (d) no mowing. The abundance of both flowers and
   flower-visiting insects increased significantly with reduced mowing,
   being ca. 3 and 5 times greater in (d) than (a), respectively, with (b)
   and (c) intermediate. Mowing intensity, however, had a weak effect on
   wildflower species richness, which was only lower in (a). A 1km bee,
   butterfly, and moth transect walk, 500m within the long grass part of
   the park and 500m within the short, recorded ca. 50x greater insect
   abundance in the long grass. A questionnaire of public opinion found
   that 97\% of park visitors favoured encouraging insects and wildflowers.
   In terms of enjoyment of the park, 26\% said that it had increased, 64\%
   said that it stayed the same, and 10\% said that it decreased. These
   results present an encouraging example of a potential win-win situation
   in urban land management change, where the interests of humans and
   wildlife are aligned, thereby making the goals of conservation easier to
   achieve.}},

Title = {{Non-targeted metabolite profiling of citrus juices as a tool for variety
   discrimination and metabolite flow analysis}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Genetic diversity of citrus includes intrageneric hybrids,
   cultivars arising from cross-pollination and/or somatic mutations with
   particular biochemical compounds such as sugar, acids and secondary
   metabolite composition.
   Results: Secondary metabolite profiles of juices from 12 commercial
   varieties grouped into blonde and navel types, mandarins, lemons and
   grapefruits were analyzed by LC/ESI-QTOF-MS. HCA on metabolite profiling
   data revealed the existence of natural groups demarcating fruit types
   and varieties associated to specific composition patterns. The unbiased
   classification provided by HCA was used for PLS-DA to find the potential
   variables (mass chromatographic features) responsible for the
   classification. Abscisic acid and derivatives, several flavonoids and
   limonoids were identified by analysis of mass spectra. To facilitate
   interpretation, metabolites were represented as flow charts depicting
   biosynthetic pathways. Mandarins `Fortune' and `Hernandina' along with
   oranges showed higher ABA contents and ABA degradation products were
   present as glycosylated forms in oranges and certain mandarins. All
   orange and grapefruit varieties showed high limonin contents and its
   glycosylated form, that was only absent in lemons. The rest of
   identified limonoids were highly abundant in oranges. Particularly,
   Sucrenya cultivar showed a specific accumulation of obacunone and
   limonoate A-ring lactone. Polymethoxylated flavanones (tangeritin and
   isomers) were absolutely absent from lemons and grapefruits whereas
   kaempferol deoxyhexose hexose isomer \#2, naringin and neohesperidin
   were only present in these cultivars.
   Conclusions: Analysis of relative metabolite build-up in closely-related
   genotypes allowed the efficient demarcation of cultivars and suggested
   the existence of genotype-specific regulatory mechanisms underlying the
   differential metabolite accumulation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{175-179}},

Abstract = {{Recent reports of pollinator declines have revealed a need to better
   document how anthropogenic disturbances and biogeography jointly
   influence wild pollinator communities. Here, we examine the effects of
   urbanization-induced habitat fragmentation on the native bee fauna
   inhabiting coastal sage scrub habitats of San Diego County, California,
   USA, a hotspot of bee biodiversity. Pitfall trapping in natural reserves
   and scrub habitat fragments yielded 70 native bee species or
   morphospecies, and revealed that bee species richness was lower in
   fragments than in reserves. However, fragments and reserves harbored bee
   assemblages similar in relative abundance, evenness, and community
   composition. Our samples yielded multiple species that are poorly
   represented in four of the leading institutions with collections of
   native bees from the southwestern United States, as well as 16 species
   represented only by specimen records from outside of San Diego County.
   Our results highlight the importance of continued efforts to document
   bee assemblages in under-studied regions with respect to their faunal
   distribution and basic taxonomy, as well as how they are impacted by
   anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat fragmentation. We also
   discuss the value of analyzing vouchered pitfall samples for non-target
   taxa captured incidentally.}},

Title = {{Contrasting impacts of pesticides on butterflies and bumblebees in
   private gardens in France}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{182}},
Pages = {{148-154}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Private gardens are an important food source and refuge for animals in
   urban areas because they represent a large part of the green space. It
   has been shown that garden management regime (water use, floral
   composition) may impact the species they shelter. However, due to access
   restrictions, lack of regulations and the difficulty of data collection
   on private property, the impact of management practices and in
   particular pesticide use has seldom been assessed in private gardens.
   Using data collected in the framework of a nationwide participatory
   monitoring scheme in France, we assess here, for the first time, the
   effect of private garden management on two important groups of
   flower-visiting insects, i.e. butterflies and bumblebees, at a large
   scale. We show that the correlation between butterfly and bumblebee
   abundance and use of insecticides and herbicides is negative, whereas
   the use of Bordeaux mixture (fungicide approved for organic use),
   fungicides and anti-slugs is positively correlated with butterfly and
   bumblebee abundance. We hypothesize that herbicides have an indirect
   negative impact on insects by limiting the amount of available
   resources, and that the Bordeaux mixture, fungicides and slug repellants
   have an indirect positive impact on these insects by fostering healthier
   plants, probably offering higher level of resources to pollinators.
   Moreover, we show that the impact of pesticides varies according to the
   landscape, the negative effect of insecticides being more important in
   highly urbanized areas. Overall, our results show that gardener
   practices can have a positive impact on flower-visiting insects, even in
   a highly anthropized, urban landscape. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Seedlessness is a desirable character in lemons and other citrus
   species. Seedless fruit can be induced in many ways, including through
   self-incompatibility (SI). SI is widely used as an intraspecific
   reproductive barrier that prevents self-fertilization in flowering
   plants. Although there have been many studies on SI, its mechanism
   remains unclear. The `Xiangshui' lemon is an important seedless cultivar
   whose seedlessness has been caused by SI. It is essential to identify
   genes involved in SI in `Xiangshui' lemon to clarify its molecular
   mechanism. In this study, candidate genes associated with SI were
   identified using high-throughput Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). A
   total of 61,224 unigenes were obtained (average, 948 bp; N50 of 1,457
   bp), among which 47,260 unigenes were annotated by comparison to six
   public databases (Nr, Nt, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, COG, and GO). Differentially
   expressed genes were identified by comparing the transcriptomes of no-,
   self-, and cross-pollinated stigmas with styles of the `Xiangshui'
   lemon. Several differentially expressed genes that might be associated
   with SI were identified, such as those involved in pollen tube growth,
   programmed cell death, signal transduction, and transcription. NADPH
   oxidase genes associated with apoptosis were highly upregulated in the
   self-pollinated transcriptome. The expression pattern of 12 genes was
   analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. A putative
   S-RNase gene was identified that had not been previously associated with
   self-pollen rejection in lemon or citrus. This study provided a
   transcriptome dataset for further studies of SI and seedless lemon
   breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat loss is the leading cause of extinctions on the planet. However,
   negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity can
   be reduced if resources in urban or semi-natural areas in the
   surrounding matrix can be used by wildlife.
   We investigated the influence of floral and nesting resources in urban-
   and forest-associated oak-savannah fragments, surrounding urban and
   forest matrix, and urban areas spatially independent from oak-savannah
   habitat on pollinator community composition in a fragmented oak-savannah
   ecosystem.
   Both independent urban and urban matrix sites supported high abundance
   and richness of plants and pollinators relative to other fragment
   categories, especially towards the end of the season when plants and
   pollinators in oak-savannah fragments were scarce. A species of
   particular conservation concern in our region, Bombus occidentalis, was
   supported by late-flowering resources in our urban sites.
   Forest-associated oak-savannah fragments were missing late-season
   species while urban-associated fragments supported high abundance and
   richness of mid- to late-season pollinators, likely due to supplemental
   use of floral resources in the urban matrix. Female cavity-nesting and
   ground-nesting bees were not restricted by the availability of natural
   nesting resources we expected them to require (e.g. small cavities, bare
   soil).
   These results provide important information on native pollinators in a
   highly fragmented habitat, and suggest that we should consider matrix
   quality in conservation planning.}},

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted in 2008 and 2009 in Citra, FL, to evaluate
   the effects of seeding rate and removal of apical dominance of sunn hemp
   (Crotalaria juncea L.) on weed suppression and seed production by sunn
   hemp. Three seeding rates of sunn hemp were used: a representative seed
   production rate of 11 kg.ha(-1), an intermediate seeding rate of 28
   kg.ha(-1), and a cover crop seeding rate of 45 kg.ha(-1). Cutting the
   main stem at 3, 4, or 5 weeks after planting to break apical dominance
   was compared with an uncut treatment. Cutting had no significant effect
   on shoot biomass, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) penetrating
   the canopy, and nondestructive leaf area index (LAI). As a result,
   cutting also had no effect on weed density and biomass in 2008 and very
   little effect in 2009. Increase in seeding rate resulted in linear
   decrease in PAR and increase in LAI in both years. Seeding rate had a
   greater effect on suppression of weed biomass than on suppression of
   weed density. There was a linear decline in sunn hemp branching with
   increased seeding rate in 2009 and, averaged across years, flower number
   decreased linearly with increased seeding rate. Cutting to break apical
   dominance induced branching but had no effect on flower number. No seed
   pod production occurred and we postulate that the lack of seed
   production may be the result of the absence of effective pollinators in
   fall when short-day varieties of sunn hemp flower in Florida.}},

Abstract = {{Four grapevine varieties cultivated in Romania, two known from ancient
   times (Tamaioasa romaneasca and Italian Riesling) and the other two
   derived by cross-breeding or free-pollination from these (Sarba and Alb
   Aromat, respectively) were cultivated in the same conditions and
   vinified by using the same technology, so that the assessment of their
   volatile profile with an electronic nose would reflect only their
   differences and similarities. Sarba variety was obtained in 1972 in
   Odobesti region and is supposedly genetically related to Italian
   Riesling and a muscat-type grape. Although the research information is
   scarce and some popular sources cite as ancestors either the Italian
   Riesling or the Tamaioasa, while some other mention both, the Vitis
   International Variety Catalogue (http://www.vivc.de/)mentions as
   pedigree ancestors confirmed by markers the Italian Riesling and Muscat
   of Hambourg. As for the Alb Aromat variety it was obtained at the
   Pietroasa Research station by self-pollination of Tamaioasa and
   officially registered in 1999. It may also have in its pedigree the
   grape Maria Pirovano, as mentioned in the Vitis International Variety
   Catalogue. Both these new varieties are semi-aromatic, with a
   muscat-based aroma profile derived from the parent aromatic variety. The
   resulted wines were analyzed with a double column gas-chromatograph
   functioning as an electronic nose, providing fingerprints of the
   volatile substances profile for each sample. The statistical analysis of
   the volatile profiles confirmed that Sarba is likely to have a
   parent-offspring relationship with both Italian Riesling and Tamaioasa
   (or other muscat-type grape), while the Alb Aromat has a closer profile
   only to Tamaioasa. More detailed studies are needed to confirm the exact
   parentage of these two grape varieties, as well as the applicability of
   the electronic nose as a fast and economic, but at the same time
   adequate instrument, for assessing parentage relationships among grape
   varieties. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to ensure good-quality software, there is need to test all
   possible inputs. Owing to the fact that the exhaustive testing is hardly
   feasible, many software testing approaches has been proposed.
   Combinatorial Interaction Testing (CIT) is very promising technique to
   minimize the number of test cases. Although useful, most of exiting CIT
   strategies and tools focus on data inputs and assume ``sequence-less{''}
   interactions between input parameters. However, reactive systems show
   sequence related behaviors and their faults may not expose if the
   sequence of inputs are not considered. In this paper, we propose a new
   t-way strategy (i.e. t refers to the degree of the combination)
   strategy, called Flower Strategy (FS), that addresses both sequence and
   sequence-less test generation. Experimental results show that FS
   produces test size.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, a growing number of studies have focused on the
   potential interest of urban green areas for supporting biodiversity.
   Private gardens, urban parks or green roofs may support relatively high
   densities of diverse wild bees. Knowledge is lacking regarding bee
   assemblages in Paris, the French capital, and one of the most densely
   populated part of France. In this context, we here provide a first
   assessment of the taxonomic and functional composition of bee
   assemblages in three urban parks in downtown Paris. Bees were sampled
   with a set of three coloured pan traps per park. Fifteen 24-hour
   sessions were performed from April to July 2011. We captured 425
   specimens from 44 species representing five families and 11 genera. The
   assemblage was dominated by Halictidae (15 species representing 70.1\%
   of total abundance), especially the eusocial species Lasioglossum morio
   that made 25.2\% of total abundance. From a functional point of view,
   there were only two species of parasitic bees that made 1.2\% of total
   abundance. Most non-parasitic species were polylectic and below-ground
   nesting. This study highlights the importance of preserving and managing
   urban parks and other green areas to promote the conservation of wild
   bees and ultimately the functionality of pollination service in urban
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Development of the new yellow kiwifruit cultivar named `Hort. 16 A' and
   marketed under the ZESPRI (TM) Gold kiwifruit brand is a remarkable and
   innovative scientific and commercial success story which encouraged
   kiwifruit breeders in the world to breed color flesh kiwifruit. For the
   first time Golden kiwifruit seeds have been imported from USA to Iran in
   2003 by Y. Ebrahimi, a pioneer Iranian scientist on citrus and kiwifruit
   culture with numerous studies and researches on citrus and kiwifruit in
   his workbook. Of all the seeds, only 12 Golden kiwifruit seedlings were
   reached to final evaluation and bloomed in spring 2006. Seven seedlings
   were male and five of them were female under the codes of EMM1-7 and
   EMF1-5. The fruits originated from the five female seedlings were very
   small in size compared to the original Golden kiwifruit. In spring 2007,
   the pollen of seven male seedlings were collected and pollinated with
   `Hayward' kiwifruit. The result was 504 seedlings which were planted in
   a well-drained composted land and forced them through stem ringing to
   bear the first fruits. In 2012, 20 of the seedlings did bear their first
   fruits with different shape, size and taste with yellow color flesh and
   three of them EMF6, EMF7 and EMF8 were released in the north of Iran.
   This paper will explain all about the kiwifruit breeding programs and
   characteristics of three released genotypes in Caspian Sea Region.}},

Abstract = {{The Eucalypts, or Gum Trees (genera Eucalyptus, Corymbia and Angophora)
   contain unique flora with over 800 species throughout Australia (and its
   closest northern neighbours) and represents one of Australia's greatest
   floral icons. Eucalypts play a vital role in all Australia's ecosystems
   providing habitat for native birds, insects and animals. Eucalypts
   inhabit a diverse range of habitats, from dry deserts, to lush
   rainforests and windswept coastal cliffs. There are a great number of
   species that are rarely seen in cultivation, with highly ornamental
   flowers, leaves, buds, and fruit, and small habits. Researchers at the
   University of Adelaide's Ornamental Eucalypt Development Program (OEDP)
   have been investigating the development of ornamental eucalypts since
   1991, using controlled pollinations to investigate relationships between
   species and to breed new interspecific hybrids. The new hybrids then
   undergo selection and development for suitability for different markets.
   Clonal propagation is a major bottleneck to new variety development, and
   while grafting is commonly used for some varieties of flowering gums,
   this program has sought to develop tissue culture methods for
   propagation of selected forms. The Program is now in the final ``Proof
   of Concept{''} phase, with large scale trialling of the first round of
   selections. The OEDP is an example of where collaboration between
   University-led research and Industry-focused development, can produce
   outcomes that benefit all key stakeholders. This paper will report on
   the process we have undertaken from idea to variety.}},

Abstract = {{Loquat species are native to China. It is grown in temperate and
   subtropical areas, sharing the same environmental areas as citrus. The
   main producing country in the world is China, although there is
   production in Mediterranean countries and Japan. Most of the cultivars
   come from selection of chance seedlings, however, there is germplasm
   collected that included the diversity generated where the species was
   spread. Currently, breeding programs focused on the creation of new
   cultivars that meet the farmers' and consumers' demands are being
   carried out in China, Japan, and Spain. Development of molecular markers
   for assisted selection, genetic diversity studies and new breeding
   techniques are providing new tools for breeding progress. Exploitation
   of the polyploidy provides opportunities for reaching new types of
   fruits including seedlessness, increase in fruit quality, and enhanced
   productivity. Loquat should benefit from improvement of biotechnology
   applied to breeding. The species has possibilities of becoming an
   important crop in subtropical and Mediterranean climates.}},

   lies in the recognition of the dynamics in European culture. If we want
   European citizens to identify with Europe, we will have to offer them a

   it be found in a European history or culture. Europe does not have a
   common cultural identity, a shared web of significance. A way out of
   this dilemma is conceiving European culture as the result of a
   continuous cross-pollination. Such a view is presented here in an
   exemplary model of art teaching, looking at Flemish and Dutch art as a

Abstract = {{A number of studies conducted since the turn of the millennium have
   identified several deficits in engineering education; the most widely
   cited are deficits in critical analysis, systems thinking, and
   visualizing non-linear cause effect chains. The field of engineering
   education has undergone a number of notable changes in response to such
   identified deficits but recent field studies such as Vision 2030
   identified remaining shortfalls in engineering competencies as well as
   significant discrepancies in the perception of the severity of these
   deficits. While academic engineering programs feel that their programs
   adequately prepare engineering students for the practice of engineering,
   entry-level hiring managers disagree.
   In the practice of medicine, decision-making in practicing physicians is
   a critical competency which can make the difference between appropriate
   and incorrect diagnoses, and may affect the patient's well-being or his
   life. Making a decision for an appropriate treatment plan in the face of
   insufficient or contradicting data points often times is compounded by
   the fact that time-scales can be significantly shorter than in the case
   of a machine design project. And while the majority of patients is
   discharged from hospital care in better health, medical professionals
   and educators are questioning their own approach to decision making in
   light of technological advances affecting their disciplines, and because
   of an improved understanding of the biochemistry and opportunities of
   genetic manipulations of the human body. Therefore, the field of medical
   decision making is also undergoing an overhaul in the education and
   training of medical students.
   This paper contrasts the current decision-making competencies that are
   imparted as part of the respective fields' academic education,
   identifies the challenges in each discipline, and identifies
   opportunities for cross-pollination of better practices to develop
   decision-making competencies.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive exploatation and processing of natural resources, such as.:
   coal, and industrial development, urbanization and transport resulted,
   especially in Silesia region, to circulate large quantities of
   contaminants, including - mercury. As a result of anthropogenic
   activities in the absence of awareness of the impact of processes on the
   environmental and waste management at the mismanagement of the
   extraction and processing of the associated coal redounded to
   contamination of the environment, the implications are felt to this day.
   Waste from coal mining are mainly deposited in landfills. In Poland,
   despite the rise in recent years, the use of these wastes, mainly in the
   work of the post-mining reclamation areas, their deposition in landfills
   is growing. For the deposition of waste from coal mining speak of such
   premises as:
   high cost of processing waste materials and the difficulty in
   maintaining the stability of their quality parameters
   the environmental impact of waste treatment operations,
   risks associated with investing in new technologies of waste disposal.
   Therefore, it is necessary to the implementation of a comprehensive
   research program to identify the risks associated with waste disposal,
   the penetration of xenobiotics in the environment of deposition and
   picking remedies. In assessing the impact of coal waste depositing soil
   and soil environmental tests were performed around landfills, including
   before and after the band-shaped ditch, the total mercury content and
   other elements, and rated the road mobility of mercury. The paper shows
   how the study areas in the vicinity of landfill mining and presents the
   results of their contamination. The results confirmed that in these
   areas there are no significant exceedance of land contamination and
   elevated levels of mercury are merely local. Also permissible loads of
   heavy metals, including mercury, which may be introduced during the year
   on agricultural land, and such inter alia, are located in the vicinity
   of landfills, only a few points have been exceeded. High levels of
   contaminants found mainly in the trenches around landfills, where they
   are subject to re-emission into the atmosphere along with the processes
   of pollination or runoff.}},

Abstract = {{The cultivated husk tomato (Physalis ixocarpa) (2n = 2x = 24) is native
   from Mexico and Central America and shows a wide genetic variation.
   Presently, it is the fourth horticultural crop in cultivation surface in
   Mexico. The working team of this research previously developed an
   autotetraploid population by using colchicine. The objectives of the
   present work were to analyze the ploidy level and meiotic behavior of
   the subsequent generations (C3, C4, C5, C6) from the original (C2)
   composed only by plants with the duplicated genome from the Rendidora
   cultivar, and to determine pollen viability. As a diploid control the
   cultivar Rendidora of P. ixocarpa was used. Ploidy level was determined
   by flow citometry and meiotic analysis. For the meiotic study, the
   microsporocytes were prepared by the squash method, stained with carmin
   and analyzed in diakinesis. Pollen viability was evaluated through
   0.01\% Buffalo Black staining. The tetraploid condition prevailed
   through four cross-pollinating generations, maintaining a constant
   chromosome number 2n = 4x = 48. In diakinesis, the chromosomes of the
   diploid cultivar were associated into bivalents, whereas in tetraploid
   plants the chromosomes associated into univalents, bivalents and
   trivalents. Highly significant differences in bivalent pairing were
   detected between autotetraploid plants and between generations. Pollen
   viability did not show significant differences between generations and
   allowed reproduction. These results indicate that it is possible to
   develop an autotetraploid cultivar, because the polyploid state is
   naturally maintained and the plants are fertile. Furthermore, given the
   differences in bivalent pairing between plants and generations, a
   response to selection toward meiotic stability is expected.}},

Abstract = {{This is the first complete inventory of stingless bees in El Salvador.
   It includes the spatial distribution of wild and managed colonies and
   the relationships between their occurrence and vegetation cover,
   altitude and temperature. Applying a stratified sampling, we located
   wild colonies (n=477) and managed colonies (n=686) of stingless bees in
   tropical forests, agricultural fields and urban areas. Each stratum (14)
   was a department (political division) of El Salvador. We made maps of
   the distribution of the most common wild and managed species. We
   analysed spatial distribution of colonies through the Clark and Evans
   Index (CEI). For the estimation of diversity between departments, the
   Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H) was calculated. The relationship
   between species richness and vegetation cover was analysed through the
   chi-square test. Linear regression was used to evaluate the effects of
   altitude and temperature on species richness. We concluded that: (a)
   there are at least 20 species, six subgenera and 10 genera of stingless
   bees in El Salvador; (b) the departments with highest levels of
   diversity were Santa Ana (H=2.55), Chalatenango (H=2.41), Morazan
   (H=2.31) and La Libertad (H=2.22); (c) the most abundant wild species,
   was Tetragonisca angustula (n=156, relative abundance=32.70\%) and was
   found in each department in clustered pattern (CEI=.26, p<.001); (d)
   Melipona beecheii (n=405, relative abundance=59.04\%) was the most
   frequent managed species, mainly found in a clustered pattern (CEI=.28,
   p<.001) in the northern and the western part of El Salvador; (e) the
   species richness is associated with the vegetation cover: increased with
   coniferous forest (X-2=336.1, p<.001), fruit trees (X-2=41.8, p<.001),
   and with temperature (r=.86, p=.0015) but decreased with altitude

Abstract = {{`Hyuganatsu' (HY) is a self-incompatible citrus cultivar grown in
   specific prefectures in Japan. However, its bud mutation, `Nishiuchi
   Konatsu' (NK), is self-compatible, although the majority of seeds are
   aborted in mature fruits. In our previous studies, we revealed that NK
   produces a proportion of unreduced 2n pollen grains, resulting in
   unusual seed development. In this study, we therefore focused on seed
   and embryo development after pollination of HY, NK, and `Hassaku' (HS),
   which is compatible with both HY and NK, with NK pollen. Seeds from HY x
   NK and NK x NK fruits were significantly smaller than those from
   HS-pollinated fruits (i.e. HY x HS and NK x HS) at 10-12 weeks after
   pollination, suggesting that the seed abortion phenotype was expressed
   during this time period. Moreover, embryos that formed from NK
   self-pollination were shown to have aborted at 10 weeks after
   pollination, whereas control embryos reached the globular or
   heart-shaped stage. HS x NK resulted in both normal and aborted seeds
   present in the fruit. Development of some embryos was found to cease at
   12 weeks after pollination. At 14 weeks after pollination, normal and
   aborted seeds were easily distinguishable. Preliminary attempts of
   embryo rescue were also conducted in order to recover triploid
   seedlings. Aborting embryos obtained from HY x NK and NK x NK were
   placed on MT media supplemented with 500 mg/L malt extract, 50 g/L
   sucrose, and 5 mM GA(3). As a result, several triploid plantlets were
   confirmed by flow cytometry after embryo recovery from both crosses,
   although the success rate was not high.}},

   Seedlessness is one of the most important characteristics for mandarin

   from December until the end of January. Fruits are easy-to-peel, with a
   diameter of 50-60 mm, and rind is deep orange red in color. `Albir' was
   obtained from a cross between `Fortune' and `Kara' mandarins. Fruits
   reach optimum maturity at the beginning of February, although they can
   be harvested from January until second half of February. Fruits are
   easy-to-peel with a diameter of 60-70 mm and fruit rind is orange red in
   color. This variety has the same origin as `Safor', a previously
   released triploid hybrid. The fruits of the two varieties are somewhat
   similar, but `Albir' matures one month earlier. With these cultivars,
   `Albir' and `Safor', it will be possible to supply similar fruits to the
   market from January to the end of March.}},

Abstract = {{Seedlessness is a major criterion for the citrus fresh fruit market.
   Therefore, triploidy breeding appears very promising for the selection
   of new citrus cultivars. CIRAD has developed a method to produce
   triploid hybrids by somatic hybridization between diploid and haploid
   lines and demonstrate the potential for haploid citrus production by
   induced gynogenesis in clementine. In this work we analyzed the
   efficiency of induced gynogenesis by irradiated pollen in `Wilking'
   mandarin (Citrus reticulata). Four doses of gamma irradiation of `Meyer'
   lemon pollen were tested (150, 200, 250, 300 Grays). Embryos were
   extracted from small seeds, obtained in immature fruits, and cultivated
   in vitro. The ploidy level of plantlets was determined by flow cytometry
   analysis. Irradiated pollen appeared to be efficient for gynogenesis
   induction in `Wilking'. A relatively high number of haploids (7
   plantlets) was obtained, essentially after hybridisation with pollen
   irradiated at 250 Grays. The ploidy level of all haploid plantlets was
   confirmed by chromosome count. These haploid lines should be useful for
   triploid breeding by somatic hybridisation and also constitute
   interesting resources for genomic studies.}},

   All samples were fixed in FPA70 solution and stored at 4 degrees C.
   Pistil samples were stained with aniline blue and observed by

Abstract = {{Gamma irradiation of buds is a technique that has been successfully used
   in citrus breeding programs that seek to produce seedless or low seeded
   selections of known cultivars. In 2007, the Pontificia Universidad
   Catolica de Chile CITRUS lab with FONDEF funds started a new breeding
   program of mandarins and lemons using this technique. The gamma
   irradiated and grafted buds were grown in commercial nurseries and then
   transplanted in 2009 to a field trial with 4500 hybrid mandarins, 1200
   clementines and 2500 lemons, in Pomaire, Chile (33 degrees 39'S, 71
   degrees 10'W). First evaluations of fruit seed content were made between
   2010 and 2011. Early productions were achieved by the use of high
   density planting, minimal pruning managements, fertirrigation and
   enhancement of cross pollination using 10 to 12 hives/ha. After 2
   harvest seasons, most phenotypical variations have been observed in
   lemons, obtaining 164 seedless selections, 4 thornless selections and a
   different fruit shape and compact selection interesting for ornamental
   purposes. In the case of mandarins, 14 individuals have been found as
   seedless selections and an individual shows narrow leaves, kumquat type
   fruit with low seed production. Techniques used in this program allow
   shortening in 5 years the time spent obtaining new citrus varieties. The
   stability of mutations detected is being evaluated and new commercial
   field trials will be established with the selected materials.}},

Abstract = {{Despite potential benefits granted by genetically modified (GM) citrus
   trees, their release and commercialization raises concerns about their
   potential environmental impact. The transfer via pollen of transgenes to
   cross-compatible cultivars is deemed to be the greatest source for
   environmental exposure. In this work, three different citrus genotypes
   carrying the uidA (GUS) tracer marker gene (pollen donors) and a non-GM
   self-incompatible contiguous citrus genotype (recipient) were used in
   conditions allowing natural entomophilous pollination to occur. The
   examination of 603 to 2990 seeds per year showed unexpectedly low
   frequencies (0.17-2.86\%) of transgene flow. Paternity analyses of the
   progeny of subsets of recipient plants using 10 microsatellite (SSR)
   loci demonstrated a higher mating competence of trees from another
   non-GM pollen source population that greatly limited the mating chance
   of the contiguous cross-compatible and flowering-synchronized transgenic
   pollen source. This mating superiority could be explained by much higher
   pollen competition capacity of the non-GM genotypes, as was confirmed
   through mixed-hand pollinations, indicating that pollen competition
   strongly contributed to transgene confinement. This is the first study
   on transgene flow in citrus. It provides crucial information on the
   safety and field performance of GM citrus that can serve as a basis for
   further field trials and as a guide for (case-by-case) regulatory
   policies.}},

Abstract = {{Prickly pear cactus O. ficus-indica is known to express polyembryony at
   a range of 0,5-20\%. This polyembryony is one of many forms of apomixis
   process by which some plant species are able to develop embryos without
   fertilization. Such process has been described here in a local spineless
   accession of O. ficus-indica. Histological investigations realized on
   ovules picked 10 days after anthesis, revealed the presence of two
   separate kinds of apomixis, (i) a gametophytic one where embryos are
   developed in one or two embryo sacs via apomeiosis and (ii) a
   sporophytic (also called adventitious embryony) one where embryos are
   developed from unreduced cells of the nucellus. Gametophytic
   embryogenesis reached advanced stages such as heart shaped embryos, but
   sporophytic embryogenesis remained at undifferentiated stages consisting
   in meristematic cells with large nuclei and dense cytoplasm. Improvement
   of apomictic ability has been envisaged by GA(3) applications on
   emasculated flowers before anthesis, in order to enhance the in vitro
   somatic embryogenesis from immature embryos and also to produce
   parthenocarpic fruits. These objectives have really been reached, indeed
   somatic embryogenesis from GA(3)-treated explants developed more
   embryogenic callus than open-pollinated control and fruits obtained from
   emasculated and treated flowers showed a relative size reduction and
   contained empty seeds with persistent teguments. Results were more
   evident in the case of 500 ppm GA(3) dose.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is an ecosystem service affected by anthropogenic activity,

   Orchids worldwide have a wide range of pollination systems, but many New
   Zealand orchids are self-pollinating. We studied the pollination system
   of three saprophytic native orchids from the genus Gastrodia in modified
   landscapes in Canterbury, New Zealand: G. cunninghamii, G. minor, and an
   undescribed taxon G. ``long column{''}. The species showed two distinct
   pollination systems. Gastrodia cunninghamii and G. minor were autonomous
   selfing species. In contrast, G. ``long column{''} had almost no fruit
   set when pollinators were excluded, and was visited by the endemic New
   Zealand bee Lasioglossum sordidum, which acted as a pollen vector in
   order to produce fruit. Visitation rate by L. sordidum varied among four
   sites around Christchurch, and natural fruit set in G. ``long column{''}
   ranged from 76\% where L. sordidum were abundant to 10\% where bees were
   not observed. Oddly, some of the highest natural fruit-set rates were at
   a highly modified urban site. Therefore, while some Gastrodia species
   are dependent on native pollinators, they can still persist in highly
   modified landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Aggressive contests between animals are common but rarely result in
   death because the benefits of winning a fight rarely exceed the cost of
   losing. Lethal combat can evolve, however, when the contested resource
   translates to much of the future reproductive success of each combatant.
   Female agaonid fig wasps pollinate and lay their eggs in the flowers
   within the enclosed inflorescences ({''}figs{''}) of fig trees (Ficus
   spp.). Wasps rarely leave the first fig entered so the reproductive
   success of each ``foundress{''} usually depends on the availability of
   flowers within a single fig. We report for the first time lethal combat
   between female agaonids, in the undescribed Pegoscapus sp. that
   pollinates Ficus citrifolia in southeastern Brazil. In staged dyadic
   contests, wasps showed no aggression outside or inside the fig until one
   foundress oviposited. The first wasp to oviposit then became aggressive,
   which usually resulted in the death of its competitor. Examination of
   dead foundresses in naturally occurring figs showed that injuring
   competitors, particularly through decapitation, was effective at
   reducing their oviposition rates. In a Panamanian F. citrifolia
   population, pollinated by another wasp species, Pegoscapus tonduzi,
   there was little aggression between foundresses in similar contests. We
   suggest that reduced aggression in P. tonduzi reflects less competition
   for resources essential for successful reproduction due to on average
   fewer foundresses per flower in Panama.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to evaluate the floral biology and
   pollination requirements of seeded and seedless mini watermelon
   varieties, and to determine the best varieties to cultivate under
   protected environment. Three seedless (HA-5106, HA-5158, and HA-5161)
   and two seeded (Minipol and Polimore) genotypes were tested. Flowers
   were monitored from the pre-anthesis stage to senescence, and fruit
   quality was also evaluated. The evaluated treatments were
   hand-geitonogamous pollination (MG), cross-pollination with pollen from
   the Polimore variety (MCP), cross-pollination with pollen from the
   Minipol variety (MCM), and restricted pollination. All varieties had
   monoecious plants with diclinous flowers, and the stigmas remained
   receptive throughout anthesis. Fruit set rates of 84.62\% (MG), 61.54\%
   (MCP), 48\% (MCM), and 0\% (restricted) were obtained for seeded
   varieties, but of 0\% (MG), 76.36\% (MCP), 82.69\% (MCM), and 0\%
   (restricted) for seedless varieties. Fruits did not differ in quality
   among treatments within each genotype. Therefore, all the studied
   varieties require a pollination agent and diploid pollen for fruit set
   to occur, regardless of the donor variety; and Minipol or Polimore with
   HA-5106 or HA-5158 are the varieties recommended for cultivation in
   protected environment.}},

Abstract = {{Urban mangrove systems are increasingly common in SE Asia but little is
   known about the potential changes in pollinator ecology in highly
   urbanized and fragmented landscapes. We detected pollen limitation
   across four Bruguiera gymnorrhiza populations in Singapore with a pollen
   limitation index (compromised seed production due to insufficient pollen
   receipt) ranging from 0.633 to 0.878. Trees in larger patches had higher
   pollinator visitation rates than in smaller patches, and lower
   pollinator visitation rates resulted in reduced fruit sets. These
   results suggest a cascading link between habitat patch size, pollinator
   visitation rate, and reproductive outcomes in B. gymnorrhiza. Mating
   system analysis indicated that B. gymnorrhiza may have an internal
   mechanism acting against inbreeding depression, leading to reduced fruit
   set under circumstances of reduced pollinator visitation. Our results
   underscore the importance of pollinator service in mangroves and
   highlight the need for an in-depth understanding of changing
   plant-pollinator relationships in urban mangroves systems. (C) 2014

Title = {{Airborne pollen levels and drug consumption for seasonal allergic
   rhinoconjunctivitis: a 10-year study in France}},
Journal = {{ALLERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{99-106}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Few time-series studies, and none lasting longer than 4
   years, have investigated the etiology of treated seasonal allergic
   rhinoconjunctivitis (SAR) on the basis of anti-allergic medication
   prescriptions. The aim of this article was to study the short-term
   relationship between pollen exposure and drug-treated SAR over 10 years
   in an urban area in central France.
   Methods: A SAR case was defined as the association between an oral
   antihistamine and a local anti-allergic drug on the same prescription.
   The relationship between daily changes in pollen concentrations and
   daily changes in the number of treated SAR cases was analysed using
   generalized additive models, taking into account confounding factors
   such as air pollution, weather and days of the week.
   Results: Between 2003 and 2012, the total yearly number of treated SAR
   cases rose from 7265 to 11 315. The relative risk of treated SAR
   associated with an interquartile increase in pollen concentration
   increased significantly for Fraxinus, Betula, Carpinus, Platanus,
   Poaceae and Urticaceae for the whole pollen season, and for Urticaceae
   in the first semester.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of treated SAR cases rose by about 55\% in
   10 years. The study not only confirmed the highly allergenic role of
   Fraxinus, Betula and Poaceae pollens but also showed a relatively
   unknown association between treated SAR and Carpinus and Platanus
   pollens, despite their pollen counts being <1\% of overall pollen
   concentration. It also showed robust correlations with Urticaceae
   pollens, especially during the first semester, suggesting a potential
   allergenic role of Parietaria pollination in this non-Mediterranean
   area.}},

Abstract = {{Insects and other invertebrates provide essential ecosystem functions in
   designed habitats including green roofs. Services offered by
   invertebrates in these novel environments include pollination for plant
   reproduction and yield in cultivated crops, pest control to reduce
   damage to green roof vegetation, decomposition to retain organic matter
   and cycle nutrients in the substrate, and contribution to food webs for
   species like birds that frequent green roofs.
   Although we may assume that beneficial invertebrates are desirable on
   green roofs, it is not clear whether they adequately provide habitat or
   not. Green roof design can vary, as can their suitability as habitat,
   some supporting almost no species and others meeting both the foraging
   and nesting requirements of many. When designers include plant,
   substrate and other microhabitat conditions to support certain at-risk
   species or functionally important groups, green roofs may act as analog
   habitat where it is limited at ground level. Green roofs are uniquely
   isolated and exposed to sun and wind and their relative value will
   ultimately depend on the invertebrates in question. If green roofs are
   to support invertebrate communities, elucidating habitat requirements
   and monitoring wildlife design successes are as essential as public
   outreach that encourages urban biodiversity conservation.}},

   the present study, we investigated the morphological characteristics in
   doubled haploid induced by colchicine-treated axillary shoot buds of a
   haploid plant from `Banpeiyu' pummelo {[}C. maxima (Burm.) Merr.]. We
   also evaluated the reproductive potential of the doubled haploid as a
   male or a female parent by crossing with some diploids. In term of the
   results, this doubled haploid had significantly large leaf, flower and
   fruit compared with those of the original haploid plant. Moreover, the
   doubled haploid showed higher pollen fertility (84.1\% stainability and
   32.9\% pollen germination rate) and a larger number of seeds (47.2
   developed seeds per open-pollinated fruit) than the haploid. In the
   reciprocal crosses between the doubled haploid and some diploids, many
   developed seeds were obtained. These seeds germinated normally and
   developed into diploid seedlings. These results show that the doubled
   haploid will be valuable for genetic analysis and possibly for planned
   breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of research. Croton glandulosus L. is a ruderal annual species
   of Euphorbiaceae native to the American tropics and widespread in urban
   and rural areas in Brazil. We investigated the structure,
   histochemistry, and ultrastructure of glands on the inflorescence axis
   of C. glandulosus to explore the relationship between their structure
   and function.
   Methodology. Reproductive apexes were prepared according to standard
   methods for plant anatomy, SEM., and TEM. Histochemical tests were
   performed using fresh material.
   Pivotal results. Mature glands are bowling pin shaped and are
   differentiated into a single-layered secretory epidermis arranged
   radially around a parenchymatous central axis supplied with xylem. In
   the neck region of the glands, the epidermal cells present structural
   components typical of lipophilic secretion, whereas the parenchyma cells
   are specialized in the production of hydrophilic compounds. The resinous
   secretion is released by cuticle pores occurring exclusively on the tip
   of the gland.
   Conclusions, This is the first report of the occurrence of colleters on
   the inflorescences of a Croton species. Our observations clearly
   indicate that glands on the inflorescence axis of C. glandulosus are
   resin-secreting colleters that may have important protective functions.}},

Abstract = {{The Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky),
   threatens urban and forest hardwood trees both where introduced and in
   parts of its native range. Native to Asia, this beetle has hitchhiked
   several times in infested wood packaging used in international trade,
   and has established breeding populations in five U.S. states, Canada,
   and at least 11 countries in Europe. It has a broad host range for a
   cerambycid that attacks living trees, but in the introduced ranges it
   prefers maples. Identification, classification, and life history of this
   insect are reviewed here. Eradication is the goal where it has been
   introduced, which requires detection of infested trees using several
   approaches, including ground and tree-climbing surveys. Several agencies
   and researchers in the United States and Europe are evaluating the use
   of pheromone- and kairomone-baited traps. Control options beyond cutting
   down infested trees are limited. To date, the parasitoids and predators
   of this beetle have broad host ranges and are unlikely to be approved in
   the United States or Europe. An effective delivery system under
   development for entomopathogenic fungi appears promising. Systemic
   insecticides have been widely used in the United States, but the ability
   of these chemicals to reach lethal doses in the crown of large trees is
   disputed by some scientists, and the potential nontarget effects,
   especially on pollinators, raise concerns. The most practical approach
   for eradicating Asian longhorned beetle is to optimize trapping methods
   using semiochemicals for early detection to eliminate the insect before
   it spreads over large areas.}},

Abstract = {{Parasitodiplogaster has been considered to be an internal specialised
   parasite of the pollinating fig wasps. We found that the second-stage
   juveniles of Parasitodiplogaster citrinema emerge directly from the eggs
   retained in the ovaries, penetrate the adult female wasps at their
   eclosion from their galls, and moult to inactive dauers.
   Parasitodiplogaster dauers are ensheathed, and do not abandon the living
   host, while the pre-adults become necrophagous inside the wasp cadaver.
   The adult nematodes emerge from the wasp's cadaver 72 h (up to 240 h)
   after the wasp perishes. Parasitodiplogaster citrinema was found to be
   proovigenic, has about 15 developed eggs in each oviduct and is
   ovoviviparous. Unfed caged adult female wasps remained alive for 65 h
   despite being infected. The dauers do not feed or grow inside the living
   hosts, and the adults seem to feed on dead fig tissues.}},

Journal = {{URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{1027-1039}},
Abstract = {{Urban parks are isolated fragmentary areas within the urban environment,
   providing both recreational spaces for its citizens and habitat for
   birds. This study focuses on analyzing factors, which affect the
   richness of breeding bird communities in 26 urban parks within Beijing
   city. A bird census and a survey of biological factors were carried out
   from April to November, 2012. Simultaneously, non-biological factors
   were examined. A path analysis based on a structural equation model was
   carried out to explore biological and non-biological environmental
   variables affecting bird communities breeding in wooded habitats. In
   total, 38 species of wild breeding birds were observed in the 26 parks.
   Based on the results, we conclude that the size of green space in parks
   is the most significant variable affecting bird occurrence. Green spaces
   surrounding a park are positive and significant factors for breeding
   bird communities. Wild grasses/herbs are also crucial because they
   maintain a high level of insects. Omnivorous bird species and birds
   nesting in trees did benefit by an increasing area covered by coniferous
   trees, by increasing richness of grass/herb species and increasing
   richness of woody plant species. The richness of insect communities
   (phytophagous and pollinating insects) has a significant effect on the
   richness of breeding bird communities. This study confirmed the
   importance of connectivity that the parks are connected to surrounding
   green spaces, thus forming an integrated green system avoids impervious
   surfaces. Proper management of coniferous woody plants, promoting wild
   grasses/herbs, reducing the area of planted monocultures and minimizing
   the use of pesticides in urban vegetation management will contribute
   effectively to improve the quality of breeding bird habitats in urban
   parks. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Production of seedless citrus fruits is required for the fresh market
   because consumers do not accept seedy fruits. Development of new
   seedless mandarin cultivars has a high priority for many citrus
   industries worldwide. The recovery of triploid hybrids is the most
   promising approach to achieve this goal, since triploids have a very low
   pollen and ovule fertility. They are seedless or produce very low
   numbers of seeds and do not induce the formation of seeds in other
   cultivars by cross pollination. In Spain we are carrying a triploid
   breeding program since 1996 based on 2x x 2x, 2x x 4x and 4x x 2x sexual
   hybridizations followed by embryo rescue and flow cytometry, together
   with the use of different approaches to produce new tetraploid parents.
   The objective is to obtain new high quality easy peeling and seedless
   mandarin cultivars. More than thirty spontaneous autotetraploid
   apomictic genotypes to be used as male parents have been selected from
   seedbeds by flow cytometry. Also nine autotetraploid non apomictic
   genotypes, mainly to be used as female parents, have been obtained by
   chromosome duplication with treatments of micrografted shoot tips with
   colchicine or oryzalin. Symmetric protoplast fusion is also being used
   to produce allotetraploid genotypes. So far, we have obtained more than
   5,500 triploid hybrids from 130 parental combinations by 2x x 2x
   pollinations, more than 4,300 triploid hybrids from 100 parental
   combinations by 2x x 4x pollinations, and more than 5,600 triploid
   hybrids from 103 parental combinations by 4x x 2x pollinations. In 2008
   we released the first cultivars originated in the program, the seedless
   late maturing mandarins `Garbi' and `Safor', obtained from 2x x 2x
   crosses. More than 400,000 trees of these cultivars have been planted by
   growers during the last three years.}},

   the mid-19th century to the present. The most rapid phase of extinction
   appears to be related to changes in agricultural policy and practice
   beginning in the 1920s, before the agricultural intensification prompted
   by the Second World War, often cited as the most important driver of
   biodiversity loss in Britain. Slowing of the extinction rate from the
   1960s onward may be due to prior loss of the most sensitive species
   and/or effective conservation programs.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of protected cultivation in world agriculture has driven
   crops traditionally cultivated in open field to greenhouse, which, in
   turn, prevent the access of pollinators to flowers. Therefore, it is
   necessary to identify suitable pollinators for closed environments.
   Stingless bees have been identified in Brazil as the ideal pollinators
   for crop pollination under greenhouse conditions. Colonies of two
   stingless bee species (Melipona subnitida Ducke) and Scaptotrigona sp.
   nov. were evaluated in a greenhouse during the flowering of seeded
   (diploid) and seedless (triploid) mini watermelon (Citrullus lanatus T.)
   varieties. The feasibility of using these bees in this production system
   was based on their adaptation and foraging behavior. M. subnitida did
   not show any interest to the crop under the experimental conditions; and
   this species stopped foraging trips and egg laying in a diapause-like
   stage. In comparison, Scaptotrigona sp. nov. foragers were active and
   collected floral resources soon after their introduction. Moreover, the
   foragers of Scaptotrigona sp. nov. showed an essential behavior for mini
   watermelon pollination, because they visited staminate and pistillate
   flowers from both seeded and seedless genotypes for nectar collection.
   Thus, we concluded that M. subnitida did not adapt to greenhouse mini
   watermelon cultivation under the experimental conditions and should not
   to be used for pollination purposes in this environment; however,
   Scaptotrigona sp. nov. adapted well as a pollinator in the greenhouse
   and can be used for mini watermelon pollination in protected culture.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are well known for their contribution to the ecosystem
   service of pollination. In urban areas, green space management
   beneficial to pollinators can be an important step in sustaining large
   urban bee populations. The abundance, number of species and diversity of
   bumblebees (Bombus spp), as well as the abundance of honeybees (Apis
   mellifera), were studied in 13 urban gardens (including allotments) and
   13 ornamental flowerbeds (in parks and green spaces) in the city centre
   of Gothenburg, Sweden. In total, 12 species of bumblebees were observed.
   Species richness was significantly higher in gardens than in flowerbeds,
   but diversity (Berger-Parker and Simpson indices) was higher in
   flowerbeds than in urban gardens. The abundance in gardens was
   significantly higher and approximately twice that found in flowerbeds.
   The number of honeybee individuals was positively correlated with the
   abundance of bumblebees. Neither species richness nor abundance of
   bumblebees was affected by site size. However, a high flowering
   frequency positively affected the total number of bumblebee and honeybee
   individuals at the sites. We conclude that urban gardens contribute to
   sustaining a high abundance of bumblebees in the city centre, and
   indirectly facilitates small scale urban food production. A
   pollinator-friendly management of urban green space with plentiful
   flowering may promote a community of bumblebees with high abundance and
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Vanilloideae comprises 15 genera distributed worldwide, among which are
   Vanilla and Epistephium (tribe Vanilleae). Based on field and laboratory
   investigations, the pollination biology of V.dubia and E.sclerophyllum
   was analysed. The former was surveyed in a semi-deciduous mesophytic
   forest at the biological reserve of Serra do Japi and in a marshy forest
   at the city of Pradopolis, southeastern Brazil. The latter was examined
   in rocky outcrop vegetation in the Chapada Diamantina, northeastern
   Brazil. In the studied populations, the tubular flowers of V.dubia and
   E.sclerophyllum were pollinated by bees. Pollen was deposited on either
   their scutellum (V.dubia) or scutum (E.sclerophyllum). The mentum region
   of V.dubia is dry, whereas that of E.sclerophyllum presents a small
   quantity of dilute nectar. Flowers of E.sclerophyllum are scentless,
   while those of V.dubia are odoriferous. Although V.dubia is
   self-compatible, it needs a pollinator to produce fruit. In contrast,
   E.sclerophyllum sets fruit through spontaneous self-pollination, but
   biotic pollination also occurs. Both species are primarily adapted to
   pollination by euglossine bees. Pollination by Euglossina seems to have
   occurred at least twice during the evolution of Vanilleae. Furthermore,
   shifts between rewarding and reward-free flowers and between autogamous
   and allogamous species have been reported among vanillas.}},

Abstract = {{Fragmentation of habitats by roads, railroads, fields, buildings and
   other human activities can affect population size, pollination success
   and fruit production, especially in plants showing pollinator
   limitation, such as Mediterranean orchids. In this study, we
   investigated the effect of human activity on the population dynamics and
   reproductive success of the orchid Serapias cordigera. Three anthropic
   and three natural populations were monitored over 14 years (1999-2012),
   classifying individuals into five stage classes and evaluating
   reproductive success. Population growth rates differed between anthropic
   and natural populations. Our results demonstrated that small anthropic
   populations have lower population viability compared with large natural
   populations. The proportion of flowering plants, the number of
   reproductive plants and the percentage of fruits were significantly
   lower in anthropic than in natural populations. This strong decline in
   fruit production in populations in urban areas may reflect lower
   pollination attraction and higher inbreeding in small than in natural
   populations. Calculation of extinction probabilities showed that the
   anthropic populations will drop below the survival threshold of 15-20
   years. This study highlights that continued monitoring is needed to
   improve information on population viability and for appropriate

Abstract = {{Pollinators are in global decline. One of the few ways in which the
   general public can help is by cultivating ornamental garden plants that
   attract pollinators by producing nectar, pollen, or both. Advice in the
   form of lists of recommended plants is available, but how good are these
   recommendations? Here, we overview a sample of 15 such lists and discuss
   their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we found that the range
   of the number of plant genera per list was large (29-257) and that there
   was rather little overlap in the recommendations, even among lists
   addressing the same geographic region (e.g., Britain or North America).
   Furthermore, the lists often included poor recommendations, omitted many
   good plants, lacked detail, and were almost invariably based on their
   authors' general expertize rather than on empirical data. Nevertheless,
   some advice given in the lists was good, because these recommendations
   were presumably backed by personal observations and less formally
   gathered data. The lists were also very appealing to the public, which
   makes them an excellent tool in communication and a useful starting
   point for further research.}},

Abstract = {{Birds play crucial role on the pollination of many plants. However,
   little is known about the interactions between nectarivorous neotropical
   birds and exotic Angiosperms. S. nilotica is an exotic African plant
   widely used in Brazilian urban landscaping. However, it has been poorly
   studied in relation to its interactions with Neotropical birds. In this
   way, we studied the feeding nectar strategies and the interspecific
   antagonistic behaviours among nectarivorous Neotropical birds to verify
   the bird contributions to the S. nilotica pollination. The study was
   conducted from May 2008 to April 2011, but only in months of S. nilotica
   flowering (April to May). From 148 hours of sampling we identified 16
   species feeding nectar on S. nilotica: 13 hummingbirds (Trochilidae),
   Aratinga aurea (Psittacidae), Tangara palmarum (Thraupidae) and Coereba
   flaveola (Coerebidae). Eupetomena macroura was the most frequent
   (96.88\%), followed by Chlorostilbon lucidus (78.13\%) and Coereba
   flaveola (59.38\%). Most birds obtained nectar by punching at the base
   of the corolla, except for A. aurea that obtained the nectar by the
   upper opening of the petals in 100\% of its visits, Heliomaster furcifer
   (95.65\%), F. fusca (95\%) and A. nigricollis (70.27\%). Despite E.
   macroura also obtains nectar only by punching at the base of the
   corolla, it showed the highest level of legitimate visits. Antagonistic
   events were more frequent in E. macroura (58.65\%), Florisuga fusca
   (11.04\%) and Amazilia fimbriata (10.87\%), being E. macroura dominant
   in all events. These results showed E. macroura plays an important role
   on this plant being the most important bird as a potential pollinator.
   Moreover, other birds contribute partially to the S. nilotica
   pollination. Most probably it is a result of recent Neotropical bird
   interactions with this African plant.}},

Abstract = {{This document marks the official release of US Furr, a hybrid of
   Clementine x Murcott, and US Furr-ST, an irradiated variant of US Furr
   with apparent field tolerance to citrus scab (causal agent Elsinoe
   fawcetti Bitanc. and Jenk.). The hybridization creating US Furr and
   ultimately US Furr-ST was made at the USDA Horticultural Research
   Laboratory in Orlando, Florida, by Dr. Phillip Reece in 1953. Seeds were
   sent to the USDA Date and Citrus Station in Indio, California for hybrid
   evaluation. Dr. Joseph Furr identified this superior selection from the
   resulting seedlings. US Furr has been sufficiently promising that it has
   been introduced into at least five countries, under several different
   names. Budwood of US Furr was introduced into Argentina, Brazil, France
   (Corsica), Israel, and Spain in the 1980s and 1990s using material prior
   to irradiation and some possibly post-irradiation. `US Furr' and US
   Furr-ST are high quality, December/January-maturing mandarins with
   excellent rind color, superior flavor, and moderate peelability (rind
   comes off in pieces similar to Sunburst and Murcott). US Furr and US
   Furr-ST are sexually self-compatible and fruit in mixed plantings
   average 12 to 24 highly polyembryonic seeds per fruit, and 6 to 12 seeds
   per fruit when planted in isolation from compatible pollinating
   varieties. Furthermore, very few to no fruit are set when flowers are
   bagged, indicative of low parthenocarpy. US Furr and US Furr-ST fruit
   average 150-215 g per fruit at maturity. US Furr and US Furr-ST trees
   are moderately vigorous, thornless, and spreading with fairly dense
   foliage. The diversity of names used for US Furr / US Furr-ST has
   reduced awareness that a single genotype has garnered wide attention,
   limiting impact and resulting in few US plantings. It is anticipated
   that this official release will garner increased interest in these
   cultivars leading to increased plantings. Many tasters report that US
   Furr and US Furr-ST are among the best tasting citrus they have eaten.
   These mandarin cultivars merit consideration for planting as a part of a
   mid-late season mandarin portfolio, and are released without any
   intellectual property restrictions.}},

Abstract = {{A mismatch of resource availability in certain periods can lead to
   spillover of insects between habitats, resulting in temporal differences
   in insect diversity. Urban gardens are important anthropogenic habitats
   but it is unknown whether, when and why spillover of beneficial insects
   occurs between gardens and agricultural habitats. We used trap nests for
   Hymenoptera to monthly monitor bee and wasp abundance and species
   richness in 12 gardens and 12 rapeseed fields. Half of the gardens and
   rapeseed fields were located in the urban-rural interface and bordered
   each other (a garden paired with a rapeseed field) and the other half
   were isolated in the rural landscape (isolated rapeseed fields) and in
   the urban city centre (isolated gardens). In general, gardens in the
   urban-rural interface comprised the highest richness of bees and wasps.
   The abundance of bees but not of wasps was highest in paired habitats
   and peaked at full rapeseed blooming, indicating that mass-flowering
   rapeseed offers foraging resources for bees nesting in adjacent gardens.
   Thus, bees nest and increase their populations in both areas, benefiting
   from the mass-flowering resource in the agricultural habitat as well as
   the nesting resources from gardens, suggesting spillover of bees but not
   of wasps between paired gardens and rapeseed fields. Our study
   highlights the value of gardens in the urban-rural interface for the
   biodiversity of functionally important insects. Implementing urban
   gardening and small-scale agriculture in cities and suburban habitats
   can promote local pollinator populations and benefit adjacent croplands.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fragmentation threatens the reproduction of tree species, for
   which habitats overlap with urban and rural areas. An endangered maple,
   Acer miyabei f. miyabei, is such a species in northern Japan. We
   examined the effects of forest fragmentation on seed production and mate
   diversity and assessed gene flow within and between fragmented forests.
   We measured the density, viability, and kinship of seeds dispersed
   around 82 target trees in 21 fragmented forests in rural and urban
   areas. The dispersed seed density decreased as the size of the target
   trees and the number of adult trees in each forest decreased. The viable
   seed proportion also decreased as the number of adult trees in each
   forest decreased. We did not find any effects on the kinship
   co-efficient among seeds dispersed around each target tree. The
   regression line of the pairwise kinship co-efficient of the seeds
   against the distance had a higher intercept and a more gently declining
   slope between the forests than within the forests, indicating forest
   fragmentation altered gene flow patterns. The results suggest reduced
   seed production due to pollen limitation and changes in the genetic
   structure of regenerating populations of A. miyabei in fragmented
   forests.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the mangrove Avicennia marina in the Sydney region exist
   as stands of varying size, reflecting both natural and anthropogenic
   fragmentation. We hypothesised that, as observed in many terrestrial
   forests, small stands (< 100 plants) would experience lower pollinator
   densities and altered pollinator behaviour and visitation and, in
   consequence, would display reduced pollen deposition as compared with
   large stands (> 10,000 plants). Nevertheless, we recognise that such
   predictions may be overly simplistic because within this region A.
   marina attracts a diversity of flower visitors, but its only significant
   pollinator is the exotic honeybee Apis mellifera. Moreover, it is
   unclear how readily A. mellifera moves among groups of plants within
   different mangrove stands of varying sizes separated either by water or
   urban habitat matrix. Our detailed surveys within pairs of large and
   small stands in two locations support the predictions that pollinator
   density and pollen deposition are reduced or altered within small
   stands. Within small stands honeybee abundance and pollen deposition
   were on average reduced significantly by 84 and 61 \%, respectively.
   Moreover, within small stands there was a non-significant 12 \% increase
   in the mean time that honeybees spent foraging on individual plants and
   hence potentially depositing self pollen. Taken together, our data
   indicate that fragmentation affects the performance of A. mellifera as a
   pollinator of A. marina and reduce pollinator abundance, leading to
   pollen limitation in small as compared to large stands, which may
   negatively affect reproductive output.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the global trend in urbanization, little is known about patterns
   of biodiversity or provisioning of ecosystem services in urban areas.
   Bee communities and the pollination services they provide are important
   in cities, both for small-scale urban agriculture and native gardens. To
   better understand this important ecological issue, we examined bee
   communities, their response to novel floral resources, and their
   potential to provide pollination services in 25 neighborhoods across
   Chicago, IL (USA). In these neighborhoods, we evaluated how local floral
   resources, socioeconomic factors, and surrounding land cover affected
   abundance, richness, and community composition of bees active in summer.
   We also quantified species-specific body pollen loads and visitation
   frequencies to potted flowering purple coneflower plants (Echinacea
   purpurea) to estimate potential pollination services in each
   neighborhood. We documented 37 bee species and 79 flowering plant genera
   across all neighborhoods, with 8 bee species and 14 flowering plant
   genera observed on average along each neighborhood block. We found that
   both bee abundance and richness increased in neighborhoods with higher
   human population density, as did visitation to purple coneflower flower
   heads. In more densely populated neighborhoods, bee communities shifted
   to a suite of species that carry more pollen and are more active
   pollinators in this system, including the European honey bee (Apis
   mellifera) and native species such as Agapostemon virescens. More
   densely populated neighborhoods also had a greater diversity of
   flowering plants, suggesting that the positive relationship between
   people and bees was mediated by the effect of people on floral
   resources. Other environmental variables that were important for bee
   communities included the amount of grass/herbaceous cover and solar
   radiation in the surrounding area. Our results indicate that bee
   communities and pollination services can be maintained in dense urban
   neighborhoods with single-family and multi-family homes, as long as
   those neighborhoods contain diverse and abundant floral resources.}},

Abstract = {{Flowering weeds, though often deemed undesirable in turfgrass lawns,
   provide food resources for declining pollinator populations in urbanized
   landscapes. We sampled bees and other pollinators directly from
   flowering common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and white clover
   (Trifolium repens) in lawns of similar character in central Kentucky USA
   to identify species likely to be exposed if such weeds are inadvertently
   oversprayed during application of lawn insecticides. We also tested the
   hypothesis that pollinator assemblages visiting spring-blooming white
   clover in urban and suburban lawns are as species-rich and diverse as in
   more rural lawn settings. We collected about 50 different species of
   insect pollinators, including 37 species of bees, from the
   aforementioned lawn weeds. Two of the six species of bumble bees (Bombus
   spp.) collected are considered uncommon and possibly in decline. Hover
   flies (Syrphidae), honey bees (Apis mellifera), and non-Apid wild bees
   predominated on dandelions whereas proportionately fewer hover flies and
   more A. mellifera and Bombus spp. visited white clover, especially in
   summer. Species richness of bees visiting white clover was similar in
   urban, suburban or periurban-rural lawns, although A. mellifera were
   proportionately more abundant, and Bombus spp. were less abundant, with
   increasing percentage of hardscape in surrounding areas. Fostering
   public awareness of the diversity of bees and other pollinators that
   visit flowering lawn weeds might help nurture a sociocultural shift
   toward more pollinator-friendly lawn care practices.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, several studies demonstrated the effectiveness of
   ecological network analysis to a better understanding of the structure
   bee-plant interaction networks; however, such approaches involving urban
   areas are still scarce. Here, we analyzed two assemblages of corbiculate
   bees (Apoidea, Apidae) in two geographically distinct urban areas in
   Brazil. In both study areas, apid bees visiting flowers were captured
   with an insect net. Surveys were performed biweekly and alternately in
   each area, over a 1-year period. Both urban areas were very similar for
   most indices. The two social bee-plant networks were significantly
   nested, a pattern usually described for bee-plant networks and somehow
   expected in our study, considering the recognized behavior of social
   apid bees in exploring a wide range of plant species. The modularity
   measures were low and very similar for the networks of both urban areas,
   a finding that could be due at least in part to the low phylogenetic
   distance between corbiculate bees and the broad dietary habits of the
   social apid bees. Network-level indices showed that both bee assemblages
   had a relatively low niche overlap, indicating that the set of social
   apid species studied exploited differently the arrays of plants
   available. Species level index (resource range) showed that in both
   urban areas, Trigona spinipes (Fabr.) and Apis mellifera L. showed the
   higher number of interactions, a result that demonstrates the importance
   of these species in social bee-plant interaction networks in urban
   areas. Similarly to other ecosystems, these two apid species behaved as
   super-generalists in the two urban areas surveyed herein.}},

Title = {{Habitat and Forage Associations of a Naturally Colonising Insect
   Pollinator, the Tree Bumblebee Bombus hypnorum}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Bumblebees (Bombus species) are major pollinators of commercial crops
   and wildflowers but factors affecting their abundance, including causes
   of recent population declines, remain unclear. Investigating the ecology
   of species with expanding ranges provides a potentially powerful means
   of elucidating these factors. Such species may also bring novel
   pollination services to their new ranges. We therefore investigated
   landscape-scale habitat use and foraging preferences of the Tree
   Bumblebee, B. hypnorum, a recent natural colonist that has rapidly
   expanded its range in the UK over the past decade. Counts of B. hypnorum
   and six other Bombus species were made in March-June 2012 within a mixed
   landscape in south-eastern Norfolk, UK. The extent of different
   landscape elements around each transect was quantified at three scales
   (250 m, 500 m and 1500 m). We then identified the landscape elements
   that best predicted the density of B. hypnorum and other Bombus species.
   At the best fitting scale (250 m), B. hypnorum density was significantly
   positively associated with extent of both urban and woodland cover and
   significantly negatively associated with extent of oilseed rape cover.
   This combination of landscape predictors was unique to B. hypnorum.
   Urban and woodland cover were associated with B. hypnorum density at
   three and two, respectively, of the three scales studied. Relative to
   other Bombus species, B. hypnorum exhibited a significantly higher
   foraging preference for two flowering trees, Crataegus monogyna and
   Prunus spinosa, and significantly lower preferences for Brassica napus,
   Glechoma hederacea and Lamium album. Our study provides novel,
   quantitative support for an association of B. hypnorum with urban and
   woodland landscape elements. Range expansion in B. hypnorum appears to
   depend, on exploitation of widespread habitats underutilised by native
   Bombus species, suggesting B. hypnorum will readily co-exist with these
   species. These findings suggest that management could target bumblebee
   species with distinctive habitat requirements to help maintain
   pollination services.}},

Title = {{Tree density and population size affect pollen flow and mating patterns
   in small fragmented forest stands of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.)}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{328}},
Pages = {{254-261}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{In many parts of the world, once large and continuous forests have been
   replaced by a mosaic of isolated forest fragments embedded in an
   agricultural or urban landscape matrix. At the same time, stand
   characteristics such as tree population size and tree density have been
   strongly modified as a result of anthropogenic activities. Because
   increased geographical isolation can impede gene flow among forest
   fragments, and because decreased population size and tree density may
   reduce the number of local mating partners, this can be expected to
   lower the opportunity to trees for outcrossing, and to result in
   increased inbreeding, negatively impacting the viability of fragmented
   tree populations. In this study, we examined eight isolated stands of
   the wind-pollinated tree species Q. robur that strongly differed in
   population size, tree density and spatial isolation. In the centre of
   each Q robur stand, adult leaves and seeds were collected in a circular
   plot, in which we evaluated the diversity and differentiation of the
   local pollen pool, and examined mating patterns. Most forest stands
   showed high proportions of out-of-plot pollen flow (range: 0.24-0.77),
   which were positively correlated with the number and density of adult
   trees within the forest stands. Despite high outcrossing rates (>0.998),
   seeds within seed families were stronger related than what could be
   expected under panmixia, which could be attributed to small but
   significant levels of correlated paternity (0.018-0.107) and biparental
   inbreeding (0.025-0.118) within the study plots. Next to increased
   coancestry coefficients, deviations from random mating also resulted in
   significant pollen pool differentiation (0.008-0.059) among seed
   parents. We also found that stand population size and tree density were
   significantly correlated to the relatedness of the seedlings and the
   degree of pollen differentiation within the study plots. These results
   suggest that, in small and isolated low density forest stands, reduced
   mate availability may decrease local pollen pool diversity, increasing
   the likelihood of consanguineous mating and pollen pool differentiation
   in the next generations. We conclude that preserving high levels of
   pollen flow within and between forest fragments may be more important in
   wind-pollinated tree species than what was previously thought. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The need to conserve biodiversity and ecosystem services in urban
   landscapes is widely recognised, yet specific planning and design
   strategies that promote conservation in urban areas are limited. Little
   is known about the ability of different types of urban green spaces to
   support biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. In this study, we
   compared the abundance of beneficial arthropods (predators and bees) and
   measured predation services in two different types of green space, areas
   of turf and prairies. Beneficial arthropods and predation services were
   measured three times during the 2011 field season in six Chicago (IL,
   USA) parks that contained both turf and prairie. Using a repeated
   measures analysis, we found bee abundance was significantly higher in
   the prairie compared to turf by August, and predator abundance was
   higher in the prairie throughout the summer. While predation services
   were not significantly different between the turf and prairie in June,
   predation steadily increased in the prairie over the course of the
   summer with significantly higher rates of predation by August. Of the
   predators measured, spiders were positively correlated with prairie
   habitat and negatively correlated with the survival of pest insects. We
   found turf and prairie differentially supported beneficial arthropod
   abundance and ecosystem services, suggesting the type of green space
   incorporated into urban areas may be an integral component to expanding
   the conservation potential of urban landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Fruit set is highly relevant to a plant's reproductive success. Fruit
   set can vary due to predation on flowers, pollinator services and/or
   resource availability. Reproductive success, measured as the fruit set
   of the invasive Lantana camara and the endemic Lantana peduncularis in
   the cool-dry season and the warm-wet season of the Galapagos Islands,
   was studied. Also, autonomous self-pollination ability and seed
   viability were probed for both species. Furthermore, flower visitors and
   their activity were registered for both species during the warm-wet
   season. Lantana peduncularis produced fewer flowers per inflorescence,
   but had a higher fruit set in the cool-dry season, compared to the
   warm-wet season. In contrast, the fruit set in L. camara did not change
   seasonally. The fruit set in L. camara was higher than in L.
   peduncularis in the warm-wet season. Moreover, similar to 18\% of the
   bagged flowers of the invasive Lantana produced fruits by autonomous
   self-pollination, while for the endemic Lantana, the rate of autonomous
   self-pollination was very low. More than 80\% of the fruits for both
   species had at least one viable seed per fruit. The number of
   pollinators and their frequency, inflorescence-and flower-visiting rates
   and the duration of the visit per flower were higher in the invasive
   Lantana than in the endemic one. The endemic Lepidoptera Urbanus
   galapagensis (the main pollinator of both Lantana species) and the
   introduced Hymenia perspectalis were observed pollinating both Lantana
   species. These results indicate that the alien L. camara is more
   attractive to pollinators and it has reproductive advantages regarding
   fruit set in comparison with L. peduncularis, factors that contribute to
   the colonization pattern of this invasive species.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the complete life cycle of a parasite is crucial to
   understand the epidemiology and population dynamics of a disease. The
   populations of several social insect pollinators are decreasing, and
   parasites are often cited as a contributing factor. The exact
   transmission pathway of the bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi (Lipa \&
   Triggiani) (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatidae) between two hosts is still
   unknown, although a previous laboratory experiment suggests transmission
   via the nectar of flowers. Plant species may differentially protect or
   negatively affect the parasite while it resides in the flower, for
   instance if plants vary in their floral shape or the compounds present
   in their nectar. This will lead to differential transmission success and
   potentially influence disease epidemiology. In the present study we
   aimed at determining whether the parasite may indeed be transmitted in
   the nectar by the bumblebee Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera:
   Apidae). We found that parasite survival was significantly decreased in
   water with higher sugar concentrations. However, none of the
   field-collected nectar samples contained parasite cells, and no parasite
   cells were transmitted between two artificial flowers by a foraging
   worker under laboratory conditions. Our results suggest instead that
   parasite cellsmay be deposited on flower surfaces and transported on
   worker surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Plantago L. species are very common in nitrified areas such as roadsides
   and their pollen is a major cause of pollinosis in temperate regions. In
   this study, we sampled airborne pollen grains in the city of Len (NW,
   Spain) from January 1995 to December 2011, by using a BurkardA (R)
   7-day-recording trap. The percentage of Plantago pollen compared to the
   total pollen count ranged from 11 \% (1997) to 3 \% (2006) in the period
   under study. Peak pollen concentrations were recorded in May and June.
   Our 17-year analysis failed to disclose significant changes in the
   seasonal trend of plantain pollen concentration. In addition, there were
   no important changes in the start dates of pollen release and the
   meteorological parameters analyzed did not show significant variations
   in their usual trends. We analyzed the influence of several
   meteorological parameters on Plantago pollen concentration to explain
   the differences in pollen concentration trends during the study. Our
   results show that temperature, sun hours, evaporation, and relative
   humidity are the meteorological parameters best correlated to the
   behavior of Plantago pollen grains. In general, the years with low
   pollen concentrations correspond to the years with less precipitation or
   higher temperatures. We calculated the approximate Plantago flowering
   dates using the cumulative sum of daily maximum temperatures and
   compared them with the real bloom dates. The differences obtained were 4
   days in 2009, 3 days in 2010, and 1 day in 2011 considering the complete
   period of pollination.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A systematic literature review was undertaken to analyse the linkages
   between different biodiversity attributes and 11 ecosystem services. The
   majority of relationships between attributes and ecosystem services
   cited in the 530 studies were positive. For example, the services of
   water quality regulation, water flow regulation, mass flow regulation
   and landscape aesthetics were improved by increases in community and
   habitat area. Functional traits, such as richness and diversity, also
   displayed a predominantly positive relationship across the services,
   most commonly discussed for atmospheric regulation, pest regulation and
   pollination. A number of studies also discussed a positive correlation
   with stand age, particularly for atmospheric regulation. Species level
   traits were found to benefit a number of ecosystem services, with
   species abundance being particularly important for pest regulation,
   pollination and recreation, and species richness for Umber production
   and freshwater fishing. Instances of biodiversity negatively affecting
   the examined ecosystem services were few in number for all ecosystem
   services, except freshwater provision. The review showed that ecosystem
   services are generated from numerous interactions occurring in complex
   systems. However, improving understanding of at least some of the key
   relationships between biodiversity and service provision will help guide
   effective management and protection strategies. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{In 2008, in Central Italy, a low dosage of CPPU solution, 44 mu L-1 (6
   hL/ha), was sprayed on the canopy of vines of `Hayward' kiwifruit, at
   the ``break of sepals{''}, about one week before anthesis, to study its
   effects on fruit weight/size and on qualitative and nutritional
   characteristics. At harvest, CPPU, with respect to control,
   significantly increased the fresh weight by about 12\% (+ 12.6 g
   fruit(-1)) and consequently the yield per vine, without affecting fruit
   shape, firmness, dry matter (\%), total soluble solids, glucose,
   fructose, sucrose, starch, citrate, malate, vitamin C and soluble and
   insoluble oxalic acid. After 3 months of storage, CPPU-treated
   kiwifruits and the control fruit showed no difference in dry matter
   content, fruit firmness and total soluble solids. The results indicate
   that a low dosage of CPPU applied in pre-anthesis can improve fruit
   weight/size without any negative effect on fruit qualitative and
   nutritional characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in improving the biodiversity of urban and
   suburban areas. Here we report on the effectiveness of a very simple
   intervention that may be used to boost flower and pollinator abundance;
   the sowing of plots of wildflowers in amenity grasslands. The abundance
   of flowers, bumblebees (Bombus spp.), and hoverflies (Syrphidae) was
   surveyed in 30 such plots, either 1 or 2years after they had been sown.
   Overall, sown plots had 25 times more flowers, 50 times more bumblebees,
   and 13 times more hoverflies compared to paired control plots. Floral
   abundance and bee abundance increased from year 1 to year 2, but
   hoverflies were more abundant in plots in their first year, reflecting
   their preference for shallow annual flowers. Our data demonstrate that
   flower-poor amenity grasslands can be readily converted to flower-rich
   areas that are highly attractive to pollinators, providing a simple tool
   for pollinator conservation in urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{Urban gardens may support bees by providing resources in otherwise
   resource-poor environments. However, it is unclear whether urban,
   backyard gardens with native plants will support more bees than gardens
   without native plants. We examined backyard gardens in northwestern Ohio
   to ask: 1) Does bee diversity, abundance, and community composition
   differ in backyard gardens with and without native plants? 2) What
   characteristics of backyard gardens and land cover in the surrounding
   landscape correlate with changes in the bee community? 3) Do bees in
   backyard gardens respond more strongly to local or landscape factors? We
   sampled bees with pan trapping, netting, and direct observation. We
   examined vegetation characteristics and land cover in 500 m, 1 km, and 2
   km buffers surrounding each garden. Abundance of all bees, native bees,
   and cavity-nesting bees (but not ground-nesting bees) was greater in
   native plant gardens but only richness of cavity-nesting bees differed
   in gardens with and without native plants. Bee community composition
   differed in gardens with and without native plants. Overall, bee
   richness and abundance were positively correlated with local
   characteristics of backyard gardens, such as increased floral abundance,
   taller vegetation, more cover by woody plants, less cover by grass, and
   larger vegetable gardens. Differences in the amount of forest, open
   space, and wetlands surrounding gardens influenced abundance of cavity-
   and ground-nesting bees, but at different spatial scales. Thus, presence
   of native plants, and local and landscape characteristics might play
   important roles in maintaining bee diversity within urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{Raissa L. Berg had a remarkable career in many respects and an impact on
   the study of phenotypic integration that continues to increase over 50
   years after the publication of her seminal paper in that area. She was
   born and lived most of her life in Russia, with most of her research
   focused on measuring spontaneous mutation rates in Drosophila. She was
   forced to abandon this work during the height of Lysenko's power in
   Russia, so she turned temporarily to the study of correlation patterns
   in plants; ironically, this work has had a more enduring impact than her
   main body of research. She showed that floral and vegetative traits
   become decoupled into separate correlation `pleiades' in plants with
   specialized pollinators, but floral and vegetative traits remain
   correlated in plants that have less specialized pollination.
   Unfortunately, her plant work is often mis-cited as providing evidence
   for increased correlations among floral traits due to selection by
   pollinators for functional integration, a point she never made and one
   that is not supported by her data. Still, many studies of correlation
   pleiades have been conducted in plants, with the results mostly
   supporting Berg's hypothesis, although more studies on species with
   generalized pollination are needed.}},

Title = {{Decreasing Abundance, Increasing Diversity and Changing Structure of the
   Wild Bee Community (Hymenoptera: Anthophila) along an Urbanization
   Gradient}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Background: Wild bees are important pollinators that have declined in
   diversity and abundance during the last decades. Habitat destruction and
   fragmentation associated with urbanization are reported as part of the
   main causes of this decline. Urbanization involves dramatic changes of
   the landscape, increasing the proportion of impervious surface while
   decreasing that of green areas. Few studies have investigated the
   effects of urbanization on bee communities. We assessed changes in the
   abundance, species richness, and composition of wild bee community along
   an urbanization gradient.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Over two years and on a monthly basis,
   bees were sampled with colored pan traps and insect nets at 24 sites
   located along an urbanization gradient. Landscape structure within three
   different radii was measured at each study site. We captured 291 wild
   bee species. The abundance of wild bees was negatively correlated with
   the proportion of impervious surface, while species richness reached a
   maximum at an intermediate (50\%) proportion of impervious surface. The
   structure of the community changed along the urbanization gradient with
   more parasitic species in sites with an intermediate proportion of
   impervious surface. There were also greater numbers of cavity-nesting
   species and long-tongued species in sites with intermediate or higher
   proportion of impervious surface. However, urbanization had no effect on
   the occurrence of species depending on their social behavior or body
   size.
   Conclusions/Significance: We found nearly a third of the wild bee fauna
   known from France in our study sites. Indeed, urban areas supported a
   diverse bee community, but sites with an intermediate level of
   urbanization were the most speciose ones, including greater proportion
   of parasitic species. The presence of a diverse array of bee species
   even in the most urbanized area makes these pollinators worthy of being
   a flagship group to raise the awareness of urban citizens about
   biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Although land-use changes such as urbanization have dramatically altered
   plant-pollinator interactions, little is known about their effects on
   pollen limitation and floral traits. In this study, we examined
   pollinator visit frequency, reproductive success, and floral trait
   measurements in 12 populations of the annual andromonoecious Commelina
   communis in an urban-rural area Pollinator and mate availability
   decreased significantly with developed land area around the study site.
   Most urbanized populations suffered from significant pollinator-limited
   male and/or female reproductive success. High fruit set in urbanized
   populations may suggest the presence of high reproductive assurance by
   selfing. The stigma height and degree of herkogamy significantly
   decreased with increased pollinator limitation. Petal length, anther
   height, and/or the pollen : ovule ratio tended to be low in pollinator-
   and mate-limited urban populations. One urban population with high
   pollinator availability had flowers with higher herkogamy and stigma
   height compared to rural populations. These results suggest that
   urbanization may provide diverse selective forces that could affect the
   phenotypic variation in floral traits.}},

Journal = {{PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{86-94}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Seedlessness is a highly desirable characteristic in fresh fruits.
   However, post-fertilization seed abortion of cross-pollinated citrus
   fruit is uncommon. The factors regulating stenospermocarpy in citrus are
   unknown. In this research, we induced stenospermocarpy interfering in
   newly fertilized ovule cell division. The research also elucidates the
   most sensitive stage for ovule/seed abortion in citrus. Experiments were
   conducted with `Afourer' mandarin that cross-pollinates with several
   cultivars and species. Cross-pollinated fruitlets were treated with
   maleic hydrazide (MH), a systemic growth regulator that specifically
   interferes in cell division. MH reduced ovule growth rate, the number of
   cell layers in nucella and inhibited embryo sac expansion; moreover, the
   treatment increased callose accumulation in nucella and surrounding the
   embryo sac. Fruits developed an early-aborted seed type with an
   immature, soft and edible seed coat. Seed number (-80\%) and seed weight
   (-46\%) were reduced in mature fruits. MH also hampered cell division in
   ovary walls, mesocarp and endocarp, thus reducing daily fruitlet growth
   and increasing fruit abscission. Stenospermocarpy could only be induced
   for a short period of time in the progamic phase of fertilization,
   specifically, when ovules are ready to be fertilized (7 days after
   anthesis) to early stages of embryo sac deyelopment (14 days after
   anthesis). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We developed 708 gene-based markers for citrus genome analysis.
   Sequence-tagged site (STS) primers were designed that were located in
   conserved exon regions and whose PCR products spanned genomic introns.
   Of these, 79.7 \% comprised cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence
   markers. The gene-based markers and their annotation and position on
   Clementine scaffolds ver. 1.0 permitted comparison of the genetic map
   and the Clementine genome sequence. The 708 gene-based markers were used
   to construct a genetic map using the 87 progenies (AG population) from
   the cross between `Okitsu 46 gou' ('Sweet Spring' ('Ueda unshiu' (Citrus
   unshiu) x Hassaku (Citrus hassaku Hort. ex Tanaka)) x `Trovita' orange)
   x `Kankitsu Chukanbohon Nou 5 gou' ('Lee' (Citrus clementina x tangelo)
   x Citrus kinokuni). The markers were integrated using common STSs on
   different phase maps in cross-pollination mode. The integrated map (AGI
   map) comprised 706 loci, including two morphological traits, and spanned
   990.9 centimorgans (cM) with an average marker distance of 1.40 cM.
   These markers formed nine linkage groups (LGs) (corresponding to citrus
   physical chromosomes): LG-01 to LG-09 corresponded to Scaffold\_01,
   Scaffold\_07, Scaffold\_09, Scaffold\_06, Scaffold\_03, Scaffold\_02,
   Scaffold\_04, Scaffold\_08, and Scaffold\_05, respectively. LG-08 and
   LG-09 contained morphological traits controlling embryo color and
   seedlessness. Eighty-eight loci comprised three or more alleles on the
   AGI map; 36.4 \% of them were related to transcription factors and
   DNA-binding proteins. The 708 gene-based markers and the AGI map are
   valuable for integrating various citrus genetic maps, alignment of
   genomic sequences, chromosome assignment, and understanding the
   diversity of citrus germplasms.}},

Abstract = {{We model ``Payment for Ecosystem Services{''} as a public management of
   biodiversity (BD) provision where citizens and land users have only a
   limited understanding of the ecology. Ecosystem services (ESS) can be
   nutrient recycling, pollination, pest control, etc. and they are linked
   to BD which is the focus of management. A typical problem in nature
   valuation is that, although there might exist an eventual vehicle for
   payment (land use), the underlying ecology might be very complex. To
   solve this problem we suggest an approach in which ecosystem management
   is conducted by ecologists who possess the knowledge of pertinent
   functional relationships between species prevalence and ESS provision.
   Farmers are compensated based on priority setting and suitability of
   land as a specific acquisition. Valuation (of species) is presented as a
   simulation (of a market-like process), i.e. balancing value revelations,
   based on shadow prices of providers (farmers), users (citizens) and
   ecologists. We address conflicts with ecologists as managers, farmers as
   profit maximizers, and citizens as utility retrievers. It is primarily a
   conflict between managers who argue ecologically for preferred species
   and land users who have limited knowledge: the conflict is solved by
   balancing interests. Our approach calibrates interest functions and it
   allows for quasi-market coordination and public management.}},

Abstract = {{The spread of non-native invasive plants is closely linked to land use
   changes imposed by human activities such as the expansion of
   urbanizations and agricultural activities that result in the loss and
   fragmentation of native forests. While the conditions generated in
   fragmented forests may provide suitable new habitat for the arrival and
   establishment of invasive plant propagules, we know little about the
   reproductive performance of established invasive populations growing in
   fragmented conditions. We assess sexual reproduction of Ligustrum
   lucidum in continuous and fragmented forests across 2 years. We also
   measure soil quality parameters in 1 year to determine their relative
   influence in shaping its reproduction in both landscape conditions. We
   observed a strong decrease in reproductive success at the population
   level in fragmented habitats. However, reproduction at the individual
   level showed no differences in seed production per tree between
   landscape conditions, implying no changes in pollination service.
   Simultaneously, soils of continuous forests had higher water content,
   total nitrogen, organic matter and carbon. These soil quality parameters
   were positively correlated with seed production and seedling number per
   plot within the same year. Thus, reproductive failure in fragmented
   forests would not be the result of Allee effects but the consequence of
   less favorable abiotic soil conditions. In current dynamic and changing
   climatic scenarios imposed by human activities, water and nutrient
   demanding invasive plants like L. lucidum might be as likely as or even
   more susceptible to these changes than native ones. Climatic shifts
   acting in concert with land use changes may either ameliorate invasion
   spread in abiotically eroded fragmented habitats or boost invasion into
   novel environments, resulting in new distribution spread patterns.}},

Title = {{Ecological outcomes of civic and expert-led urban greening projects

Abstract = {{Parks and private and public gardens do not exist in isolation, but form
   part of the urban fabric, contributing to ecological functioning. There
   is growing interest in how civil society shapes urban ecologies and
   vegetation patterns. This paper explores the ecological outcomes of a
   series of indigenous plant greening interventions in Cape Town. The six
   different sites were sampled: two civic-led intervention sites, one
   expert-led rehabilitation site, two conservation sites and one abandoned
   site. These sites are compared in terms of their plant and insect
   diversity and then discussed in relation to their contingent management
   arrangements and in relation to conservation and abandoned land. Plant
   and insect diversity measured at the civic-led greening intervention
   sites suggest these sites are similar to adjacent conservation sites,
   while floristic composition differs. The inclusion of a vacant lot with
   poor species and growth form diversity shows the significant role of
   intervention in the ecological reformation of urban green space. By
   emphasizing the ecological outcomes, this study highlights the
   importance of civil society in linking conservation goals to more
   broad-based notions of quality of life and the `good and just city'. Our
   results indicate that civic-led efforts warrant attention in keeping
   with those of experts, both in relation to meeting indigenous
   conservation targets, as well as supporting functional groups and wider
   ecological processes, with the acknowledged exception of fire. How to
   integrate such civic-led interventions into urban biodiversity
   management planning is still an open question. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Citrus crops in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, have been severely affected by
   postbloom fruit drop disease (PFD), which is caused by Colletotrichum
   acutatum. This disease leads to the drop of up to 100\% of young fruits.
   Previous studies have assumed that this pathogen exhibits a clonal
   reproductive mode, although no population genetic studies have been
   conducted so far. Thus, the genetic structure of six C. acutatum
   populations from sweet orange orchards showing PFD symptoms was
   determined using nine microsatellite markers, enabling inference on
   predominant mode of reproduction. C. acutatum populations exhibit a
   nearly panmictic genetic structure and a high degree of admixture,
   indicating either ongoing contemporary gene flow at a regional scale or
   a recent introduction from a common source, since this pathogen was
   introduced in Brazil only very recently. Sharing haplotypes among
   orchards separated by 400 km suggests the natural dispersal of fungal
   propagules, with the possible involvement of pollinators. A significant
   population expansion was detected, which was consistent with an increase
   in host density associated with crop expansion toward new areas across
   the state. Findings of moderate to high levels of haplotypic diversity
   and gametic equilibrium suggest that recombination might play an
   important role in these pathogen populations, possibly via parasexual
   reproduction or a cryptic sexual cycle. This study provides additional
   tools for epidemiological studies of C. acutatum to improve prevention
   and management strategies for this disease.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1994, more than (sic)41 billion has been spent in the European
   Union on agri-environment schemes (AESs), which aim to mitigate the
   effects of anthropomorphic landscape changes via financial incentives
   for land managers to encourage environmentally friendly practices
   {[}1-6]. Surprisingly, given the substantial price tag and mandatory EU
   member participation {[}2], there is either a lack of {[}1] or mixed
   {[}1, 2, 7] evidence-based support for the schemes. One novel source of
   data to evaluate AESs may be provided by an organism that itself may
   benefit from them. Honeybees (Apis mellifera), important pollinators for
   crops and wildflowers {[}8, 9], are declining in parts of the world from
   many factors, including loss of available forage from agricultural
   intensification {[}10-13]. We analyzed landscape-level honeybee foraging
   ecology patterns over two years by decoding 5,484 waggle dances from
   bees located in the center of a mixed, urban-rural 94 km(2) area,
   including lands under government-funded AESs. The waggle dance, a unique
   behavior performed by successful foragers, communicates to nestmates the
   most profitable foraging locations {[}14-16]. After correcting for
   distance, dances demonstrate that honeybees possess a significant
   preference for rural land managed under UK Higher Level AESs and a
   significant preference against rural land under UK Organic Entry Level
   AESs. Additionally, the two most visited areas contained a National and
   Local Nature Reserve, respectively. Our study demonstrates that
   honeybees, with their great foraging range and sensitive response to
   forage quality, can be used as bioindicators to monitor large areas and
   provide information relevant to better environmental management.}},

Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{714-721}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The past 10 years has seen a steep increase in production of seedless
   watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) in the United States. Seedless fruit is
   produced on triploid plants that require pollination from diploid
   pollenizers for fruit set. Synchronization of the staminate flowers on
   the pollenizers with the appearance of pistillate flowers on the
   triploids is a fundamental requirement for this production system.
   Previous research suggested that pistillate flowers reach peak
   production early in the season, but data are only available for a small
   number of triploid cultivars. We compared the flowering patterns of 29
   triploid cultivars and 20 pollenizers, including 10 harvested
   pollenizers, during the first 6 weeks after transplanting over 2 years.
   The average number of days from transplanting (DAT) to the first
   staminate flower was between 5.3 days and 19.1 days in 2012 and 9.7 days
   and 24.4 days in 2013 for the pollenizers and between 18.7 days and 27.6
   days and 22.1 days and 32.7 days for the pistillate triploid flowers in
   the 2 years, respectively. K-means clustering of the weekly percentage
   of plants with staminate and pistillate flowers for the different
   cultivars shows that different triploid and pollenizer cultivars have
   different flowering patterns and that some combinations have better
   synchronized flowering than others. Growers should take particular care
   when choosing pollenizers for early-flowering triploid cultivars.
   Harvested pollenizers are better suited to late-flowering triploids and
   growers should choose triploid and pollenizer cultivar combinations with
   flowering patterns that best satisfy their specific production goals.}},

Title = {{Different responses of bees and hoverflies to land use in an urban-rural
   gradient show the importance of the nature of the rural land use}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{31-41}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Most studies focusing on the effects of urban land use on pollinators
   have compared urban sites with one type of rural site. However, there is
   a lot of variation in the amount of natural habitats or intensive
   agriculture in rural areas. The position of urban areas within that
   continuum in terms of pollinator communities remains unclear. In this
   work, we studied bee and hoverfly communities (abundance, diversity, and
   species composition) in three site types along two river systems
   crossing urban areas, rural areas dominated by agriculture (termed
   rural-agricultural) and rural areas with high amounts of semi-natural
   land use (termed rural-natural). Pollinators were caught in August 2011.
   Abundance and diversity were highest in rural-natural sites for both
   taxonomic groups. Our data also indicate that hoverflies and bees
   responded differently to the surrounding land use, with bee abundance
   and diversity only significantly reduced in rural-agricultural sites but
   not in urban sites, and hoverfly abundance and diversity only
   significantly reduced in urban sites but not in rural-agricultural
   sites. The observed differences in the response of pollinators point out
   the importance of incorporating different types of rural land use and
   clearly defining the rural end of an urban rural gradient in getting a
   clear view on how urban land use affects a specific pollinator group.
   Year-round sampling of these pollinators would, however, probably enable
   a more accurate view on these responses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to supply detailed information about oak
   (Quercus sp.) pollen seasons in PoznaA{''}, Poland, based on a 16-year
   aerobiological data series (1996-2011). The pollen data were collected
   using a volumetric spore trap of the Hirst design located in PoznaA{''}
   city center. The limits of the pollen seasons were calculated using the
   95 \% method. The influence of meteorological parameters on temporal
   variations in airborne pollen was examined using correlation analysis.
   Start and end dates of oak pollen seasons in PoznaA{''} varied markedly
   from year-to-year (14 and 17 days, respectively). Most of the pollen
   grains (around 75 \% of the seasonal pollen index) were recorded within
   the first 2 weeks of the pollen season. The tenfold variation was
   observed between the least and the most intensive pollen seasons. These
   fluctuations were significantly related to the variation in the sum of
   rain during the period second fortnight of March to first fortnight of
   April the year before pollination (r = 0.799; p < 0.001). During the
   analyzing period, a significant advance in oak pollen season start dates
   was observed (-0.55 day/year; p = 0.021), which was linked with an
   increase in the mean temperature during the second half of March and
   first half of April (+0.2 A degrees C; p = 0.014). Daily average oak
   pollen counts correlated positively with mean and maximum daily
   temperatures, and negatively with daily rainfall and daily mean relative
   humidity.}},

Abstract = {{Urban green spaces, such as forest fragments, vacant lots, and community
   gardens, are increasingly highlighted as biodiversity refuges and are of
   growing interest to conservation. At the same time, the burgeoning urban
   garden movement partially seeks to ameliorate problems of food security.
   Arthropods link these two issues (conservation and food security) given
   their abundance, diversity, and role as providers of ecosystem services
   like pollination and pest control. Many previous studies of urban
   arthropods focused on a single taxon (e.g. order or family), and
   examined either local habitat drivers or effects of landscape
   characteristics. In contrast, we examined both local and landscape
   drivers of community patterns, and examined differences in abundance,
   richness, and trophic structure of arthropod communities in urban forest
   fragments, vacant lots, and community gardens. We sampled
   ground-foraging arthropods, collected data on 24 local habitat features
   (e.g., vegetation, ground cover, concrete), and examined land-cover
   types within 2 km of 12 study sites in Toledo, Ohio. We found that
   abundance and richness of urban arthropods differed by habitat type and
   that richness of ants and spiders, in particular, varied among lots,
   gardens, and forests. Several local and landscape factors correlated
   with changes in abundance, richness, and trophic composition of
   arthropods, and different factors were important for specific arthropod
   groups. Overwhelmingly, local factors were the predominant (80 \% of
   interactions) driver of arthropods in this urban environment. These
   results indicate that park managers and gardeners alike may be able to
   manage forests and gardens to promote biodiversity of desired organisms
   and potentially improve ecosystem services within the urban landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Production of seedless watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum.
   and Nakai) using soft X-ray irradiated pollen has the advantage that
   this method can be used with diploid cultivars; however, pistillate
   flowers must be covered with a bag before flowering to prevent normal
   pollination by insects. Therefore, we attempted to prevent normal pollen
   penetration by pollinating pistillate watermelon flowers with
   intergeneric pollen before anthesis. In the course of conducting these
   studies, we found a new method to produce seedless watermelon by
   pollinating with bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria (Molina) Standl.)
   pollen. When the pollen of bottle gourd was used to pollinate pistillate
   watermelon flowers, the fruit set rate was 57.1\%. On the other hand,
   the fruit set rate by pollinating with watermelon pollen was 65.0\%.
   Although the fruit set rate using bottle gourd pollen was slightly lower
   than the fruit set rate obtained when watermelon pollen was used, this
   percentage was higher than expected. Preservation of pollen collected
   from staminate flowers of bottle gourd was difficult, and fruit did not
   set. In contrast, fruit developed when bottle gourd pollen from
   staminate flowers stored at 4 C for 72 h was used to pollinate
   watermelon. All parthenocarpic fruits produced by pollination with
   bottle gourd pollen were deformed (triangular or oblong shaped). There
   was a significant difference in the ratio of fruit length to fruit
   width; however, fruit weight, rind thickness, flesh color and Brix in
   the parthenocarpic fruit were almost the same as control fruit. There
   were no normal seeds except for small, white empty seeds in the fruit
   obtained from pollinating with bottle gourd pollen. Bottle gourd pollen
   tubes did not reach the ovules of watermelon ovaries. Therefore, we
   concluded that parthenocarpy resulting from pollination with bottle
   gourd pollen was stimulative parthenocarpy, not pseudo parthenocarpy
   (pseudogamy). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Use of urban green infrastructure (GI) such as rain gardens, wetlands,
   and cisterns is a management option to provide ecosystem services such
   as storm-water detention, community green space, and pollinator habitat
   in urban core areas. It would be beneficial to efficiently and
   inexpensively characterize land parcels for GI suitability We
   hypothesize that the capability of urban soils to support green
   infrastructure might be adequately characterized by extant site land
   cover rather than comparatively expensive and slow soil sampling and
   testing. As a pilot study, we directly characterized soil taxonomic,
   physical, and chemical characteristics and measured the percentage of
   vegetated, bare, and paved land cover for perimeters and interiors of 62
   vacant lots and city parks located in Cleveland, Ohio, United States.
   All vacant lots and park areas were vegetated to some extent, and we
   were able. to relate surface vegetation to several soil properties. Our
   results indicate that vegetation is correlated to sandiness, drainage
   capability, and basic metrics of nutrient availability for these sites,
   and, that it might be possible with a group of such studies to identify
   a minimum suite of observations necessary to characterize urban lots in
   any city for GI suitability}},

Abstract = {{Most network studies on biological interactions consider only a single
   interaction type. However, individual species are simultaneously
   positioned in various types of interactions. The ways in which different
   network types are merged and entangled, and the variations in network
   structures between different sympatric networks, require full
   elucidation. Incorporating interaction types and disentangling complex
   networks is crucial, because the integration of various network
   architectures has the potential to alter the stability and
   co-evolutionary dynamics of the whole network.
   To reveal how different types of interaction networks are entangled, we
   focused on the interaction between birds and flowers of temperate plants
   in Japan, where flower-feeding birds are mainly generalist passerines,
   acting as pollinators and predators of flowers.
   Using long-term monitoring data, we investigated the flower-feeding
   episodes of birds. We constructed the whole network (WN) between birds
   and plants, separating the network into mutualistic and antagonistic
   sub-networks (MS and AS, respectively). We investigated structural
   properties of the three quantified networks and species-level
   characteristics of the main bird species. For bird species, we evaluated
   dietary similarity, dietary specialization and shifts of feeding
   behaviour relative to plant traits.
   Our results indicate that WN comprises entangled MS and AS, sharing
   considerable proportions of bird and plant assemblages. We observed
   distinctive differences in the network structural properties between the
   two sub-networks. In comparison with AS, MS had lower numbers of bird
   and plant species, showed lower specialization and modularity and
   exhibited higher nestedness. At the species level, the Japanese
   white-eye acted as pollinator, while the brown-eared bulbul acted as
   both pollinator and predator for large numbers of flowers, based on its
   behavioural plasticity. Overall, the pattern of avian feeding behaviour
   was influenced by flower size and plant origin. Birds showed nectarivory
   for plants with medium-sized flowers and exotic origins.
   Our results highlight the complex patterns of interactions between birds
   and the flowers of plants in temperate regions. They also indicate that
   understanding the interaction type for each species pair and
   consideration of the behavioural plasticity of animal species are
   important for elucidating integrated network structures.}},

Abstract = {{The absence of reproductive organs in flowers may ontogenetically arise
   from inception or by abortion during development. Ficus L, a
   species-rich genus of angiosperms, is an interesting model for floral
   developmental studies because of the diversity of sexual systems it
   contains. This study compares the floral morphology of Ficus citrifolia
   (monoecious), Ficus religiosa (monoecious), Ficus racemosa (secondarily
   monoecious), and Ficus hispida (gynodioecious) across development to
   establish the ontogenetic pathways that result in diclinous flowers.
   Figs were collected at various developmental stages and were prepared
   for surface (scanning electron microscopy) and histological (light
   microscopy) analyses. Dicliny in Ficus is defined by stamen absence from
   inception in pistillate flowers and either pistil absence from inception
   (E citrifolia,.E racemosa and E religiosa) or by abortion (E hispida) in
   staminate flowers. The perianth is formed by a single whorl of sepals,
   as found in other families related to Moraceae. The gynoecium is tubular
   during development, a condition that may be related with pseudomonomery.
   The staminate and neutral flowers in F. hispida develop by similar
   mechanisms. The diversity in the sexual systems in Ficus results from
   combinations of different floral morphs (dicliny), which originate from
   both previously established ontogenetic mechanisms (loss of reproductive
   organ function by abortion or from inception). These mechanisms act
   independently of phylogenetic proximity or mechanisms of sex system
   evolution in Ficus. Other aspects of floral development observed in
   Ficus are discussed in relation to their systematic position and
   reproductive biology.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the ecology of non-pollinating fig-wasp communities
   depends on a good knowledge of larval feeding habits of the species

   seed eaters. However, larval feeding habits are poorly known and most
   community ecology studies on NPFW are based on hypothetical feeding
   habits or data analyzed independently of feeding habit. Here we take
   advantage of the particular situation in Ficus guianensis whose
   community is dominated by large NPFW, i.e. species that are obviously
   larger than pollinators, to establish the community structure and
   feeding habits of the most frequent wasps. We provide the first
   non-ambiguous negative correlation between the number of NPFW and the
   production of pollinators and seeds. Each developing large NPFW
   represents a disproportionate cost to the mutualism as it is responsible
   for the loss of about ten seeds plus pollinators, i.e. about 10\% of the
   production of a fig. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The receptacles of fig trees (Ficus spp.) can harbor a highly
   diversified and complex community of chalcid wasps. Functional groups of
   fig wasps (e.g. gallers, cleptoparasites and parasitoids) oviposit into
   the fig at different developmental stages, reflecting different feeding
   regimes for these insect larvae. There are few direct data available on
   larval feeding regimes and access to resources. We studied the gall
   induction and larval feeding strategy of an !dames (group flavicollis)
   species, a non-pollinating fig wasp (NPFW) associated to Ficus
   citrifolia P. Miller in Brazil. This Idarnes species shares with the
   pollinator characteristics such as time of oviposition, ovipositor
   insertion through flower and location of the egg inside plant ovaries.
   Nevertheless, we show that the gall induction differs considerably from
   that of the pollinating species. This Idames species relies on the
   induction of nucellus cell proliferation for gall formation and as the
   main larval resource. This strategy enables it to develop in both
   pollinated and unpollinated figs. The large differences between this
   NPFW and other fig wasps in how ovules are galled suggest that there are
   different ways to be a galler. A functional analysis of NPFW community
   structure may require descriptions of the histological processes
   associated with larval development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{Flowering patterns result from the interactions between genetic and
   environmental factors. While the genetic basis for flowering time
   variation in commercial plants is often well understood, few studies
   have been conducted to investigate these patterns in plants without
   economic importance. Ficus microcarpa is a commonly introduced
   horticultural fig tree. Asynchrony in syconium development and the
   initiation, frequency, and size of crops may affect its fitness as well
   as the success of mutualism with its pollinating wasps. In order to
   identify genetically determined patterns in the flowering traits in E
   microcarpa, a 14-month census was taken on the flowering characteristics
   of 28 trees growing in close proximity along an urban street in Taipei,
   Taiwan. Weekly surveys were taken on 7 characteristics: crop number,
   syconia per branch, crop asynchrony, as well as flowering onset and seed
   development duration for both the spring and summer crops. Post-census
   genotyping at microsatellite loci distinguished 16 genetic groups (5
   clonal groups and 11 non-clone trees). All crop characteristics
   presented higher variation across different genotype groups than within
   groups except for seed development duration. We found no evidence of
   adjacency effects or spatial auto-correlation of flowering traits. The
   study offers the first evidence of genetic variations in the flowering
   patterns in a species of Ficus. These findings lend insight into the
   adaptive characteristics that potentially facilitate the local
   establishment of F. microcarpa in new locations. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Waggle Dance Distances as Integrative Indicators of Seasonal Foraging
   Challenges}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{APR 2}},
Abstract = {{Even as demand for their services increases, honey bees (Apis mellifera)
   and other pollinating insects continue to decline in Europe and North
   America. Honey bees face many challenges, including an issue generally
   affecting wildlife: landscape changes have reduced flower-rich areas.
   One way to help is therefore to supplement with flowers, but when would
   this be most beneficial? We use the waggle dance, a unique behaviour in
   which a successful forager communicates to nestmates the location of
   visited flowers, to make a 2-year survey of food availability. We
   ``eavesdropped'' on 5097 dances to track seasonal changes in foraging,
   as indicated by the distance to which the bees as economic foragers will
   recruit, over a representative rural-urban landscape. In year 3, we
   determined nectar sugar concentration. We found that mean foraging
   distance/area significantly increase from springs (493 m, 0.8 km(2)) to
   summers (2156 m, 15.2 km(2)), even though nectar is not better quality,
   before decreasing in autumns (1275 m, 5.1 km(2)). As bees will not
   forage at long distances unnecessarily, this suggests summer is the most
   challenging season, with bees utilizing an area 22 and 6 times greater
   than spring or autumn. Our study demonstrates that dancing bees as
   indicators can provide information relevant to helping them, and, in
   particular, can show the months when additional forage would be most
   valuable.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Urbanization is a dominant form of land-use change driving species
   distributions, abundances, and diversity. Previous research has
   documented the negative impacts of urbanization on the abundance and
   diversity of many groups of organisms. However, some organisms, such as
   bees, may benefit from moderate levels of development, depending on how
   development alters the availability of foraging and nesting resources.
   To determine how one type of low-intensity human development,
   suburbanization, affects bee abundance and diversity and the mechanisms
   involved, we surveyed bees across suburban and natural forests in the
   Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina. We sampled for bees using a
   combination of bee bowls and hand-netting from March through July of
   2008 and 2009. We found higher bee abundance in suburban than natural
   forests, and although observed species richness was greater in suburban
   than natural forests, there were no significant differences in rarefied
   richness or evenness estimates in either year. In addition, the effects
   of suburbanization were similar across bee species of varying ecological
   and life-history characteristics. At the local scale, bee abundance and
   species richness were both positively related to the abundance and
   richness of flowering species within forests, while the proportion of
   surrounding developed open areas, such as yards and roadsides, was a
   strong positive predictor of both bee abundance and richness at the
   landscape scale. These results suggest that open habitats and the
   availability of floral resources in suburban sites can support abundant
   and diverse bee communities and underscore the potential for native bee
   conservation in urban habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this trial was to test a wildflower roof in order to show how
   a country landscape fits in an urban environment. The bio-agronomic
   performance, the biodiversity dynamics during the two-years experiment,
   and the pollinating fauna, were analysed.
   Each plant group was able to efficiently colonize the surface of the
   roof though in different periods and with various modalities. Thermal
   insulation of green roof was connected to different development dynamics
   of leaf canopies. In particular, this cooling effect took place during
   the peak of the vegetation's growth pattern. As expected, each plant
   group had differing flowering periods, during which were observed
   coincided highest rate of pollinator' visits (domestic and solitary
   bees, bumblebees, lepidoptera, diptera both syrphidae and bombyliidae).
   The agronomic management, consisting in senescent vegetation mowing, was
   of crucial importance to ensure the plant equilibrium of spring and
   summer flowering species. The lack of a prevailing species was
   highlighted by several biodiversity indexes. On the contrary, early and
   late flowering species (geophytes) did not require any vegetation
   management. In conclusion, even if wildflowers exhibit critical aspects
   in terms of covering dynamics, due to the periodic senescence of
   vegetation, they represent a valid instrument to improve the
   biodiversity and the landscape of the Mediterranean urban ecosystem. (c)

   one of the most abundant bumblebee species in Europe, and these
   bumblebees are known as generalist pollinators of not only wild flowers
   in nature but also of crops in agriculture. For more than two decades,
   these bumblebees have been commercially mass reared for biological
   pollination in greenhouses. In this project, we placed commercial hives
   of the bumblebee B. terrestris containing one queen and 40 workers, in
   three different locations in the region of Ghent (Belgium), and the
   performance of these hives was followed during a 4-week period in spring
   2012. In parallel, we determined the floral richness and diversity index
   in the chosen study sites. The sites consisted of a rich urban
   environment with patchy green areas opposed to an urban environment with
   poor landscape metrics; a third rural study site showed average positive
   landscape metrics. The results demonstrated that the hive biomass and
   numbers of workers increased significantly in the rich compared to the
   poor environment, providing a mechanism to discriminate between study
   sites. In addition, the bumblebee-collected pollen showed that the
   flowering plants Salix spp. and Rosaceae/Prunus spp. are dominant food
   sources in all anthropogenic environments during early spring. Finally,
   the results are discussed in relation to the optimization of the
   experimental setup and to the use of commercial bumblebee hives in
   assessing local pollinator support within any given environment.}},

Abstract = {{Although urban gardens provide opportunities for pollinators in an
   otherwise inhospitable environment, most garden plants are not native to
   the recipient biogeographical region and their value to local
   pollinators is disputed. This study tested the hypothesis that
   bumblebees foraging in English urban gardens preferentially visited
   sympatric Palaearctic-range plants over species originating outside
   their native range.
   Twenty-seven surveys of flower availability and bumblebee visitation
   (Bombus spp.) were conducted over a 3-month summer period. Plants were
   categorized according to whether they were native British, Palaearctic
   or non-Palaearctic in origin. A phylogeny of the 119 plant species
   recorded was constructed and the relationship between floral abundance
   and the frequency of pollinator visits investigated by means of
   phylogenetically independent contrasts. Differentiation in utilization
   of plant species by the five bumblebee species encountered was
   investigated using niche overlap analyses.
   There was conflicting evidence for preferential use of native-range
   Palaearctic plant species by bumblebees depending on which plants were
   included in the analysis. Evidence was also found for niche partitioning
   between species based on respective preferences for native and
   non-native biogeographical range plants. Two bumblebees (Bombus
   terrestris and B. pratorum) concentrated their foraging activity on
   non-Palaearctic plants, while two others (B. hortorum and B. pascourum)
   preferred Palaearctic species.
   The long-running debate about the value of native and non-native garden
   plants to pollinators probably stems from a failure to properly consider
   biogeographical overlap between plant and pollinator ranges. Gardeners
   can encourage pollinators without consideration of plant origin or bias
   towards local biogeographical species. However, dietary specialist
   bumblebees seem to prefer plants sympatric with their own
   biogeographical range and, in addition to the cultivation of these
   species in gardens, provision of native non-horticultural (weed) species
   may also be important for pollinator conservation.}},

Title = {{Risks of neonicotinoid insecticides to honeybees}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{719-731}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The European honeybee, Apis mellifera, is an important pollinator of
   agricultural crops. Since 2006, when unexpectedly high colony losses
   were first reported, articles have proliferated in the popular press
   suggesting a range of possible causes and raising alarm over the general
   decline of bees. Suggested causes include pesticides, genetically
   modified crops, habitat fragmentation, and introduced diseases and
   parasites. Scientists have concluded that multiple factors in various
   combinations-including mites, fungi, viruses, and pesticides, as well as
   other factors such as reduction in forage, poor nutrition, and queen
   failure-are the most probable cause of elevated colony loss rates.
   Investigators and regulators continue to focus on the possible role that
   insecticides, particularly the neonicotinoids, may play in honeybee
   health. Neonicotinoid insecticides are insect neurotoxicants with
   desirable features such as broad-spectrum activity, low application
   rates, low mammalian toxicity, upward systemic movement in plants, and
   versatile application methods. Their distribution throughout the plant,
   including pollen, nectar, and guttation fluids, poses particular concern
   for exposure to pollinators. The authors describe how neonicotinoids
   interact with the nervous system of honeybees and affect individual
   honeybees in laboratory situations. Because honeybees are social
   insects, colony effects in semifield and field studies are discussed.
   The authors conclude with a review of current and proposed guidance in
   the United States and Europe for assessing the risks of pesticides to
   honeybees. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:719-731. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Title = {{Quantifying variation among garden plants in attractiveness to bees and
   other flower-visiting insects}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{364-374}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Pollinating insects are globally declining, with one of the main
   causes being the loss of flowers. With the value of countryside
   reducing, urban areas, particularly gardens, are increasingly recognized
   as of benefit to wildlife, including flower-visiting insects.
   2. Many gardeners specifically select plant varieties attractive to
   wildlife. Given the wide public interest, many lists of recommended
   varieties have been produced by both amateurs and professional
   organizations, but appear not to be well grounded in empirical data.
   These lists, however, are not without merit and are an obvious starting
   point. There is clearly a need to put the process onto a firmer footing
   based more on data and less on opinion and general experience.
   3. We collected data over two summers by counting flower-visiting
   insects as they foraged on 32 popular summer-flowering garden plant
   varieties in a specially planted experimental garden, with two smaller
   additional gardens set up in year two to check the generality of the
   results. With many thousands of plant varieties available to gardeners
   in the United Kingdom, and other countries or regions, it would have
   been an impossible task to make a comprehensive survey resulting in a
   complete and authoritative list.
   4. Our results are valuable and encouraging. Garden flowers attractive
   to the human eye vary enormously, approximately 100-fold, in their
   attractiveness to insects. Insects, especially bees and hover flies, can
   be attracted in large numbers with clear differences in the distribution
   of types attracted by different varieties.
   5. Our results clearly show that there is a great scope for making
   gardens and parks more beeand insect-friendly by plant selection.
   Horticulturally modified plant varieties created by plant breeding,
   including hybrids, are not necessarily less attractive to insects and in
   some cases are more attractive than their wild-type counterparts.
   Importantly, all the plants we compared were considered highly
   attractive to humans, given that they are widely sold as ornamental
   garden plants.
   6. Helping insect pollinators in gardens does not involve extra cost or
   gardening effort, or loss of aesthetic attractiveness. Furthermore, the
   methods of quantifying insect-friendliness of plant varieties trialled
   in this study are relatively simple and can form the basis of further
   research, including `citizen science'.}},

Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{401-407}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the causes and consequences of pollinator declines is a
   priority in ecological research. However, across much of the globe we
   have a poor understanding of pollinator assemblages, population trends
   and the ecological and economic importance of particular pollinators,
   due to a marked geographic bias in research effort. Here, we show that
   almost half the data cited in thirteen recent meta-analyses, which ask
   important and diverse questions in pollination ecology, were collected
   in just five countries: Australia, Brazil, Germany, Spain and the USA.
   In contrast, the entire continent of Africa contributed only 4\% of the
   data. We believe that the consequences of this geographic bias are
   severe. Foremost, pollinator assemblages (and possibly their sensitivity
   to ecological drivers) can greatly vary among these regions. In
   addition, many communities that rely on pollinators, bees in particular,
   for food security and wealth generation are in geographic regions where
   our understanding of pollination is poor. Collecting accurate
   information on pollinator populations in data deficient areas will allow
   us to identify vulnerable populations and species and so better target
   conservation measures. Moreover, it will help us to determine if our
   current understanding of pollinator losses, based on data collected in a
   few locations and on the species that predominate in those regions, is
   representative of the wide diversity of ecosystems. We propose means of
   collecting such data given socioeconomic constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization is presenting a growing problem for biodiversity
   conservation, notably by increasingly isolating over half of the world's
   population from the experience of nature. This separation of people from
   nature is an important environmental issue, as it could fundamentally
   influence the way people value nature and their willingness to conserve
   it. Here we provide the first experimental study that jointly explores
   how urban biodiversity can be enhanced and how these changes may
   influence some aspects of people-biodiversity interactions.
   We significantly increased the diversity of flowers, birds and
   pollinators in small public gardens (Paris, France) by providing
   additional resources (i.e., planting flower-meadows and placing
   nesting-boxes). Semi-structured interviews were conducted in situ with
   1116 regular garden users before and after the manipulation. Close-ended
   questionnaires were completed exploring the respondents' biodiversity
   perception and their sensitivity to the changes in biodiversity. Our
   results highlight a people-biodiversity paradox between people's
   perceptions and biodiversity awareness. Respondents expressed a strong
   preference for a rich diversity of species (excluding insects) and
   related this diversity to their well-being in the gardens. However, they
   did not notice the diversity of species. Respondents underestimated
   species richness and only noticed the changes in native flower richness
   in those gardens where advertisement and public involvement were
   organized. More experimental interdisciplinary studies are needed to
   further explore the people-biodiversity interactions. This would help
   expose the role that urban biodiversity plays in people's daily life and
   the importance of this interaction for raising public support for
   general conservation policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We present a survey of the bee fauna of Gardiners Island, Suffolk
   County, NY. The study focuses on more than 10,000 bee specimens
   collected by net during 1976, 1977, and 2005-2011. These surveys
   recorded 154 bee species and morphospecies in 30 genera. Bee species
   associated with fields, beaches, and woody plants were well represented
   in the sample, whereas those requiring herbaceous understory flowers
   were relatively few. Notable finds include several species with southern
   affinities that are otherwise scarce in New York State and paratypes of
   the social parasite Lasioglossum (Dialictus) rozeni. The newly
   discovered male of,Sphecodes johnsonii is diagnosed and imaged. Two
   Nomada morphospecies may be undescribed. A single worker of the northern
   species Bombus (Cullumanobombus) rufocinctus provides the first coastal
   record for New York State. New records of Dianthidium (D.) simile from
   nearby Long Island and of Psedoanthidium (P) minion from New York City
   (and nearby New Jersey) increase the number of bee genera and described
   species recorded from New York State to 45 and 447, respectively.
   Phenological data may provide new evidence for host-parasite

Abstract = {{Plant interactions with mutualists and antagonists vary remarkably
   across space, and have played key roles in the ecology and evolution of
   flowering plants. One dominant form of spatial variation is human
   modification of the landscape, including urbanization and
   suburbanization. Our goal was to assess how suburbanization affected
   plant-animal interactions in Gelsemium sempervirens in the southeastern
   United States, including interactions with mutualists (pollination) and
   antagonists (nectar robbing and florivory). Based on differences in
   plant-animal interactions measured in multiple replicate sites, we then
   developed predictions for how these differences would affect patterns of
   natural selection, and we explored the patterns using measurements of
   floral and defensive traits in the field and in a common garden. We
   found that Gelsemium growing in suburban sites experienced more robbing
   and florivory as well as more heterospecific but not conspecific pollen
   transfer. Floral traits, particularly corolla length and width,
   influenced the susceptibility of plants to particular interactors.
   Observational data of floral traits measured in the field and in a
   common garden provided some supporting but also some conflicting
   evidence for the hypothesis that floral traits evolved in response to
   differences in species interactions in suburban vs. wild sites. However,
   the degree to which plants can respond to any one interactor may be
   constrained by correlations among floral morphological traits. Taken
   together, consideration of the broader geographic context in which
   organisms interact, in both suburban and wild areas, is fundamental to
   our understanding of the forces that shape contemporary plant-animal
   interactions and selection pressures in native species.}},

Abstract = {{Centris flavifrons is a ground-nesting solitary bee species that has an
   important role in crop and native plant species pollination in the
   Neotropical region. However, the nesting biology and ecology of this
   species are little understood. We studied the nesting biology of C.
   flavifrons by observing 287 nests in an urban garden. Females built
   nests only during the dry season from September to March and exhibit
   notable flexibility in the amount of time each nest is active and the
   number of brood cells produced as a consequence. Nests were established
   on horizontal, sunny, sandy surfaces without vegetation. Our nest
   excavations revealed a main tunnel with lateral branches and an average
   of five cells per nest (range, 1-12 cells). The duration of a nest from
   digging to closure was on average 6.9 days (range of 2-19 days, n = 141)
   with 69 \% of nests active for 2-7 days. Mesoplia regalis was observed
   entering the nests and emerged from the cells of C. flavifrons, but the
   parasitism rate was low. The implications of this flexibility in nest
   activity duration and brood cell number and the low pressure from
   parasites are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A new quantitative index for estimating the allergenicity of tree
   species in urban green spaces takes into account allergenic potential,
   pollination strategies, duration of the pollination period, tree size
   and number of individuals per species as intrinsic parameters depending
   on the tree species concerned. Other factors analysed included the
   surface area occupied by each tree, with a view to calculating the
   overall percentage coverage of each allergenic species. The index is
   expressed as a ratio, thus enabling the design of an urban green space
   to be compared with a hypothetical space of similar characteristics and
   maximum allergenicity: the value to be obtained would thus lie between
   IUGZA = 0, for spaces with no allergenicity at all and IUGZA = 1 for
   spaces with maximum allergenicity. The expression of allergenicity by an
   abstract number facilitates comparisons and the index can be applied to
   green spaces sharing similar characteristics. A case study of Garcia
   Lorca Park, Granada, Spain, assessed the practical application of the
   index in a real-life situation. It was found that a 44.13\% of the park'
   total surface area was occupied by species with moderate to elevated
   allergenic potential. Other key factor influencing the index is the
   presence of species whose pollen is classified as a major local
   allergen. The index may also be used as a management tool for evaluating
   certain aspects which may need to be modified in order to minimise their
   allergenic impact, including the presence of single-species stands,
   hedges, and tree screens, and the prevalence of male trees. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Many polylectic bee species are known to specialize locally on one or a
   few pollen types to increase foraging efficiency. What is relatively
   unknown is how different landscapes influence foraging decisions, and
   whether habitat alteration, such as that resulting from urbanization,
   influences broad-scale foraging activities of bees. This study evaluates
   the type and diversity of pollen collected by two solitary bees that are
   common in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the native Osmia pumila and the
   exotic O. caerulescens, sampled in trap nests set up in urban parks and
   gardens. We found that the dominant pollen in every successful brood
   cell was either of one widespread, cosmopolitan lawn-invasive plant
   species (Trifolium repens) or one of two wind-pollinated tree genera
   (Quercus spp. and Betula spp.). In combination, these three represented
   more than 90 \% of all pollen collected by each bee species. Despite
   considerable overlap in the dominant pollen types collected by each bee
   species, the exotic O. caerulescens was significantly more specialized
   than the native O. pumila. Brood cells with Betula as the dominant
   pollen type were more pollen species-rich than those cells having
   Trifolium or Quercus as dominant, perhaps a result of the comparatively
   low protein content in Betula pollen.}},

Journal = {{URBAN ECOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Today's urban green space is exposed to a constant flow of newly
   introduced exotic plant species, resulting from multiple, intentional
   and inadvertent introductions. A substantial share of introduced plant
   species are represented by potential invaders of plant communities,
   which allows considering that the risk of rapid dispersion by aggressive
   plant species to be today's most serious threat to the urban
   biodiversity. Alien plant species with a short life span (monocarps,
   therophytes, annuals and biennials) are the most successful invaders
   across anthropogenically transformed landscapes. These species can have
   a significant impact on the functioning of previously disturbed
   ecosystems. At the same time, it is still unclear which mechanisms
   enable short-lived monocarps to invade under specific conditions of
   urban forest interiors. Therefore, I have conducted a literature
   analysis aiming at identifying possible biological and ecological
   determinants of monocarpic plants' invasive success in urban woodlands.
   The analysis was made at three qualitative levels taking into account
   characteristics of the urban environment, those of different types of
   urban woodlands as well as traits of non-native monocarpic species.
   Considering the city level, the main ecological factors are the high
   level of human-induced disturbance and propagule pressure on the
   urban-woodland interface sites. The level of invasion as well as
   invasibility of urban woodlands is mainly determined by the landscape
   context, whereas the habitat type, species composition and spatial
   structure play a less important role. In the forest environment, where
   competition for light and nutrients is the main shaping factor of the
   phytocoenosis, short-lived alien species must possess a certain level of
   competitive ability. These findings indicate that this ability may be
   due to such traits as high fecundity rates, effective dispersal
   mechanisms, early germination, high rate of growth and the overall big
   size of plants, presence of autonomous pollination and high
   shade-tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of pollination and non pollination on fruit and seed set was
   examined in terms of ability of self incompatibility and parthenocarpy
   with five year old trees of live Vietnamese pummelo cultivars grown in
   orchard locating at Thai Nguyen, Vietnam. Pollination of `Phuc Trach'
   pummelo with different pummelo cultivars resulted in different rites of
   fruit set and number of seeds per fruit. The highest fruit set rates of
   29.1\% in 2009 and 34.0\% in 2010 were obtained from a cross of `Phuc
   Trach' x `Dien' pummel, whereas the lowest fruit set rates of 0.6\% in
   2009 and 0.9\% in 2010 were derived from self pollination of `Phuc
   Trach' pummel. Number of seeds was ranged from 0 for self pollination to
   123 seeds for a cross with `Dien' pummelo. Observation of pollen tube
   growth in self pollinated styles of `Phuc Trach' pummelo showed that
   pollen tubes were arrested in the style and fertilization did not occur.
   These results suggest that self incompatibility and lack of
   parthenocarpy are the causes of the flower drop in `Phuc Trach' pummelo.
   The similar results as those of `Phuc Trach' pummelo were obtained in
   `Dien' and `Red Pummelo'. Thus, pollinizers are necessary for fruit set
   and enlargement of fruit in these three cultivars. On the other hand,
   `Da Xanh' and `Nam Roi' pummelos had highly vegetative parthenocarpy to
   produce large sized seedless fruit without pollination. Solid planting
   is important for these two cultivars to produce seedless fruit.}},

Title = {{The invertebrate communities associated with a Chrysanthemum

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{The escape of ornamental plants is a main pathway of invasion into many
   ecosystems. Non-native plants can alter basal resources and abiotic
   factors leading to effects that ripple throughout an ecosystem.
   Invertebrates mediate these effects-responding quickly to abiotic and
   primary producer changes and, in turn, influencing other species.
   Invasions are of particular concern in the coastal sage scrub ecosystems
   of Southern California, where habitat loss and urban encroachment
   increase invasive species propagule sources and decrease native
   community resistance. The introduced annual Chrysanthemum coronarium
   (crown daisy) is a common invader with largely undocumented
   community-level effects. Our study tested the relationships between the
   invasive Chrysanthemum and a coastal scrub invertebrate community using
   a field study at the Tijuana River Estuary. We found similar or lower
   abundances and diversity of canopy fauna in the presence of
   Chrysanthemum. Community composition dramatically differed, however, in
   the presence Chrysanthemum, which was associated with higher abundances
   of dipterans, wasps and flower beetles, and lower abundances of
   hemipterans and thysanopterans than native shrubs. Differences in
   communities were consistent at the species- and order-levels, and were
   associated with the generally greater plant biomass and shadier
   conditions afforded by the natives. This study reveals that even a
   proportionally small amount of Chrysanthemum may shift the invertebrate
   community through alterations of abiotic properties and plant biomass.
   We recommend that Chrysanthemum be removed at the first sign of invasion
   or that spread is prevented since effects on the invertebrate community
   are dramatic and occur quickly.}},

Abstract = {{Most people live in cities, but most food system studies and food
   security issues focus on the rural poor. Urban populations differ from
   rural populations in their food consumption by being generally
   wealthier, requiring food trade for their food security, defined as the
   extent to which people have adequate diets. Cities rarely have the
   self-provisioning capacity to satisfy their own food supply, understood
   as the extent to which the food consumed by the city's population is
   produced from the city's local agro-ecosystems. Almost inevitably, a
   city's food security is augmented by production from remote landscapes,
   both internal and external in terms of a state's jurisdiction. We reveal
   the internal and external food flows necessary for the food security of
   three wealthy capital cities (Canberra, Australia; Copenhagen, Denmark;
   Tokyo, Japan). These cities cover two orders of magnitude in population
   size and three orders of magnitude in population density. From traded
   volumes of food and their sources into the cities, we calculate the
   productivity of the city's regional and non-regional ecosystems that
   provide food for these cities and estimate the overall utilised land
   area. The three cities exhibit differing degrees of food self
   provisioning capacity and exhibit large differences in the areas on
   which they depend to provide their food. We show that, since 1965,
   global land area effectively imported to produce food for these cities
   has increased with their expanding populations, with large reductions in
   the percentage of demand met by local agro-ecosystems. The physical
   trading of food commodities embodies ecosystem services, such as water,
   soil fertility and pollination that are required for land-based food
   production. This means that the trade in these embodied ecosystem
   services has become as important for food security as traditional
   economic mechanisms such as market access and trade. A future policy
   question, raised by our study, is the degree to which governments will
   remain committed to open food trade policies in the face of national
   political unrest caused by food shortages. Our study demonstrates the
   need to determine the food security and self-provisioning capacity of a
   wide range of rich and poor cities, taking into account the global
   location of the ecosystems that are provisioning them. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Epidendrum L. (Epidendroideae, Laeliinae) is one of the largest orchid
   genera distributed throughout tropical America. Based on data on
   reproductive phenology, floral morphology, labellar histochemistry,
   pollinators, pollination mechanisms and breeding system, this study
   explored the reproductive biology of Epidendrum tridactylum Lindl.
   growing in the state of So Paulo, southeastern Brazil. Epidendrum
   tridactylum produces an average of 87 rewardless flowers with a
   longitudinal protuberance on the median portion of its labellum, whose
   epidermal cells produce a pleasant citric fragrance. This fragrance
   attracts both male and female flies of families Calliphoridae,
   Sarcophagidae and Syrphidae that end up drinking the extrafloral nectar
   produced at the base of the bracts. Pollinaria are removed when the fly
   proboscis contacts the viscidium in search of nectar. After removing the
   pollinarium, the fly gets trapped in the flower, which frightens it,
   thus inhibiting any possible intent to immediately visit another flower
   and, at least presumably, reducing the possibility of geitonogamy. Since
   E. tridactylum is self-incompatible, the positive consequence of such
   behavior is a reduction of pollen loss. The fruits obtained through
   experimental cross-pollinations present highly variable percentages of
   potentially viable seeds. This is the first comprehensive study on the
   reproductive biology of a myophilous Epidendrum and a pioneer report of
   effective pollinators picking extrafloral nectar from Orchidaceae.}},

Abstract = {{Moths are abundant and ubiquitous in vegetated terrestrial environments
   and are pollinators, important herbivores of wild plants, and food for
   birds, bats and rodents. In recent years, many once abundant and
   widespread species have shown sharp declines that have been cited by
   some as indicative of a widespread insect biodiversity crisis. Likely
   causes of these declines include agricultural intensification, light
   pollution, climate change, and urbanization; however, the real
   underlying cause(s) is still open to conjecture. We used data collected
   from the citizen science Garden Moth Scheme (GMS) to explore the spatial
   association between the abundance of 195 widespread British species of
   moth, and garden habitat and landscape features, to see if spatial
   habitat and landscape associations varied for species of differing
   conservation status. We found that associations with habitat and
   landscape composition were species-specific, but that there were
   consistent trends in species richness and total moth abundance. Gardens
   with more diverse and extensive microhabitats were associated with
   higher species richness and moth abundance; gardens near to the coast
   were associated with higher richness and moth abundance; and gardens in
   more urbanized locations were associated with lower species richness and
   moth abundance. The same trends were also found for species classified
   as increasing, declining and vulnerable under IUCN (World Conservation
   Union) criteria. However, vulnerable species were more strongly
   negatively affected by urbanization than increasing species. Two
   hypotheses are proposed to explain this observation: (1) that the
   underlying factors causing declines in vulnerable species (e. g.,
   possibilities include fragmentation, habitat deterioration, agrochemical
   pollution) across Britain are the same in urban areas, but that these
   deleterious effects are more intense in urban areas; and/or (2) that
   urban areas can act as ecological traps for some vulnerable species of
   moth, the light drawing them in from the surrounding landscape into
   sub-optimal urban habitats.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Pollinator-plant relationships are found to be particularly vulnerable
   to land use change. Yet despite extensive research in agricultural and
   natural systems, less attention has focused on these interactions in
   neighboring urban areas and its impact on pollination services. We
   investigated pollinator-plant interactions in a peri-urban landscape on
   the outskirts of the San Francisco Bay Area, California, where urban,
   agricultural, and natural land use types interface. We made standardized
   observations of floral visitation and measured seed set of yellow
   starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), a common grassland invasive, to
   test the hypotheses that increasing urbanization decreases 1) rates of
   bee visitation, 2) viable seed set, and 3) the efficiency of pollination
   (relationship between bee visitation and seed set). We unexpectedly
   found that bee visitation was highest in urban and agricultural land use
   contexts, but in contrast, seed set rates in these human-altered
   landscapes were lower than in natural sites. An explanation for the
   discrepancy between floral visitation and seed set is that higher plant
   diversity in urban and agricultural areas, as a result of more
   introduced species, decreases pollinator efficiency. If these patterns
   are consistent across other plant species, the novel plant communities
   created in these managed landscapes and the generalist bee species that
   are favored by human-altered environments will reduce pollination
   services.}},

Abstract = {{The abiotic and biotic characteristics of the first sites where floss
   silk tree behaves as a casual alien plant in the Mediterranean Europe
   are described. The species was probably first planted in botanical
   gardens of southern France few decades before mid XIX century. It was
   introduced in Palermo in 1896, a city which appears to match very well
   its climatic requirements. According to the available information on its
   biology and ecology in both its original and secondary range, the floss
   silk tree should not become an invasive alien plant in the
   Mediterranean. Nevertheless, several gaps need to be filled in order to
   increase our understanding of future trends of Ceiba speciosa in
   southern Europe, in particular, the eventual role of pollinators and
   seed dispersers outside the species' natural range.}},

Title = {{Spatiotemporal distribution of floral resources in a Brazilian city:
   Implications for the maintenance of pollinators, especially bees}},
Journal = {{URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING}},

Abstract = {{Cities provide resources for the animals that live in them or their
   surroundings. There has been an increase in the number of ecological
   studies in urban areas, including interactions between plants and bees.
   Bees are pollinators that provide a vital ecosystem service to crops and
   wild plants. We assessed plant community structure in the campus of
   Universidade de Sao Paulo in Ribeirao Preto, Brazil, included in the
   neotropical Atlantic Forest biome, focusing on floristic composition,
   pollination syndromes, flowering phenology, and spatiotemporal
   distribution of floral resources for bees. Currently, the city is
   surrounded by sugar cane plantations. Once a month, from April 2011 to
   March 2012, we sampled plant species and individuals in bloom in an area
   with 500 m radius from the bee-rearing facilities of Faculdade de
   Filosofia, Ciencias e Letras de Ribeirao Preto (FFCLRP), totaling 78
   hectares. We sampled 289 plant species of 73 families; Leguminosae was
   the richest family. Plants pollinated by bees predominated (67\%),
   followed by plants pollinated by hummingbirds (18\%). Melittophilous
   species flowered throughout the year and, hence, food availability for
   bees was continuous. The flowering of plant individuals that provided
   pollen, nectar, and floral oil was seasonal in all vegetation (except
   for nectar in shrubs), with peaks in resource availability in the
   transition from the dry to the rainy season, and also in the rainy
   season. Our results show that the campus is able to maintain bee
   populations amid a monoculture matrix, acting as a refuge. In addition,
   it provides a list of several attractive native plants to different
   pollinator groups, coupled with a phenogram, that can be used in the
   design and planning of urban areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{Among the endangered flora of the Mediterranean basin, Teucrium
   pseudochamaepitys, endemic Lamiaceae, is threatened by human activities.
   The threats are even more important that its distribution in
   Mediterranean France is very limited. This study was based on the
   comparison of nine sites urbanized or impacted by other human
   activities. Particularly, the associated plant community, the density
   and reproductive parameters of the study species, and pollinator
   activities were compared to asset the effect of urbanization and land
   use changes on the local population persistence. Interestingly, in urban
   sites, the result shows more ruderal species and a higher density of T
   pseudochamaepitys due to clonal growth. Surprisingly, reproductive
   success is low in each site despite an effective insect pollination.
   However, diversity of pollinators is lower in urban sites. Effects are
   thus contrasted considering urbanization and land use changes. Changes
   in land uses lead to closing landscape which threaten short term
   persistence of populations due to competition while the loss of
   pollinator diversity may impact urban populations over the long term
   only. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{121-131}},
Abstract = {{Urban land use strongly affects pollinators and plant pollination due to
   fragmentation and isolation of natural plant populations. On the other
   hand, urban land use can potentially be beneficial to pollinators
   through the presence of urban gardens and parks which are usually
   designed to ensure abundant flowering. However, little is known about
   the effects of urban land use on bees and the pollination services they
   provide. In an urban-pen-urban gradient around Leuven, Belgium we
   studied flower visitation rates to, and seed set of Trifolium repens
   (white clover) in public lawns. T. repens is an obligatory outcrossing
   plant and is therefore sensitive to reductions in pollinator services.
   We related our results to both local and regional variables using
   Boosted Regression Trees. The two variables that best explained the
   variability in visitation rates and seed set were the amount of green
   areas (gardens, parks, grasslands) in the surroundings and the abundance
   of T. repens in the lawns. Surprisingly, an increasing amount of green
   areas in the surroundings had a negative effect on both flower
   visitation rates to, and seed set of T. repens. Flower visitation rates
   by bumblebees responded positively to urban land use resulting in higher
   visitation rates and increased seed set in the more urban sites. This
   may point either to increased abundance of bumblebees in more urban
   sites or to a concentration effect of bumblebees in our urban study
   sites due to a lack of alternative forage resources. Responses will
   likely differ for other bee and plant species, but this shows that at
   least for T. repens, pollination is not compromised by urban land use.

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Ivy (Hedera helix and H. hibernica) is a common autumn-flowering plant
   found in Europe, North Africa, Macaronesia and Asia. Here, we use five
   complementary approaches (pollen trapping, nectar refractometry, local
   and regional surveys of insects foraging on ivy flowers, local survey of
   ivy abundance) to evaluate its importance to the honey bee (Apis
   mellifera) and other flower-visiting insects in Sussex, England. Pollen
   trapping at six hives in two locations showed that an average 89\% of
   pollen pellets collected by honey bees in the autumn were from ivy.
   Observations of foraging honey bees on ivy showed that ivy nectar is an
   even greater target than pollen, as 80\% were collecting only nectar.
   Refractometry of samples from ivy flowers and from honey bees foraging
   on ivy showed that ivy nectar is rich in sugar, 49\% w/w. Surveys showed
   that the main insect taxa foraging on ivy were honey bees (21\%), bumble
   bees (Bombus spp., 3\%), ivy bees (Colletes hederae, 3\%), common wasps
   (Vespula vulgaris, 13\%), hover flies (Syrphidae, 27\%), other flies
   (29\%) and butterflies (4\%). The surveys also showed significant
   temporal and spatial variation in taxon abundance and proportion. A
   survey showed that ivy was very abundant on a small scale in both rural
   and urban areas, being present in 10/10 and 6/10 0.2x0.2km samples
   within two 4x4km areas respectively. The results show that ivy should
   probably be considered a keystone species with a high value in the
   conservation of flower-visiting insects in autumn.}},

Abstract = {{The present work analyzed the stainability and in vitro germinability of
   the gamma-ray-irradiated fresh and cryopreserved pollens of 3 Citrus
   species: C. limon, C. limetta, and C. sinensis. Fruit set after
   pollinating 75 flowers of C. grandis with irradiated and nonirradiated
   (control) fresh and cryopreserved pollen was also assessed. Results
   showed that in solid and liquid culture media the highest in vitro
   germination values were detected in fresh (61.45\% and 62.53\%,
   respectively) as well as cryopreserved (53.17\% and 55.36\%,
   respectively) C. sinensis nonirradiated pollens. However, at a higher
   irradiation dose of 500 Gy in both culture media, the minimum reduction
   of germinability of fresh (30.85\% and 28.01\%) and cryopreserved
   pollens (33.37\% and 31.06\%) was found in C. limon. Contrary to in
   vitro germination, the minimum reduction in stainability of fresh and
   cryopreserved pollens, as assessed by acetocarmine (9.51\% and 11.85\%,
   respectively) and FDA tests (10.78\% and 12.73\%, respectively), was
   recorded in C. limetta. Regardless of irradiation dose, the highest
   fruit setting in C. grandis at 40 days after pollination was detected
   when it was pollinated with both fresh (38.02\%) and cryopreserved
   (34.92\%) C. limetta pollen grains.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of ruderal and mid-field vegetation promotes conservation
   of biodiversity and provides an additional source of food for insect
   pollinators. The white dead-nettle is a common synanthropic plant
   visited frequently by various groups of insects, as it is a source of
   pollen and nectar. In 2012-2013, in the city of Lublin (Poland),
   signalling and food attractants in L. album flowers were analysed using
   light and scanning electron microscopy. The pipetting method was used
   for determination of nectar abundance in the flowers, and the content of
   sugars in the nectar was assessed with the use of an Abbe refractometer.
   It was found that the white dead-nettle flowers emitted a fragrance and
   were equipped with nectar guides, and the corolla and stamens had
   glandular trichomes and papillae secreting essential oils. On the
   stamens, there are also non-glandular trichomes, which play a role of
   pollen presenters. The nectary in the L. album flower has a shape of an
   irregular disc partly surrounding the base of the ovary. The content of
   sugars in the nectar was 43\%. Sugar and honey yields per ha were
   calculated, and the values obtained were 153 kg and 191 kg,
   respectively.}},

   we compile and critically assess the literature on the chemical ecology
   of bumble bees, including cuckoo bumble bees. The development of new and
   more sensitive analytical tools and improvements in sociogenetic methods
   significantly enhanced our knowledge about chemical compounds that
   mediate the regulation of reproduction in the social phase of colony
   development, about the interactions between host bumble bees and their
   social parasites, about pheromones involved in mating behavior, as well
   as about the importance of signals, cues and context-dependent learning

Abstract = {{Pure breeding (homozygous) lines are important in genetic and genomic
   studies of higher plants. However, obtaining homozygous lines of
   perennial woody plants, using conventional breeding methodology, is very
   difficult because of long reproductive cycle, a high degree of
   heterozygosity and strictly cross-pollinating nature. Due to this
   reason, there has been an increased global interest to look for an
   alternative approach to produce homozygous diploid lines. In this
   context, the in vitro haploids, with a gametophytic chromosome number,
   represent an immediate, one-stage route to produce homozygous diploids.
   There are several methods available for development of haploids and
   doubled haploids, of which in vitro culture technique is the most
   effective and widely used. This review states the genesis, recent
   advances and critical factors and their impact on in vitro haploid
   production in tree species.}},

Abstract = {{The seedless watermelon could be a popular fruit within Portuguese
   consumers if the quality of the crop is high and if it is profitable for
   growers. The agricultural area of Idanha-a-Nova has excellent
   characteristics for the production of irrigated crops, in particular
   common watermelon, being already renowned for the excellent quality of
   these fruits. One field experiment has been carried out to test the
   yield of seedless watermelon in open field conditions, with black
   polyethylene mulch and drip irrigation, using the cultivar Romalinda
   (seedless, triploid) with two planting spacings and the seeded
   watermelon cultivar Augusta (pollinating cultivar, diploid). The
   experiments were laid out in a randomized block design, with two
   replications, each with four rows. In block I the cv. Romalinda and cv.
   Augusta were in the ratio of 2: 1, respectively, in each line (50 plants
   of cv. Romalinda and 25 plants of cv. Augusta) and in block II the trial
   area was planted on four beds with two rows of Augusta on either side of
   the trial (50 plants of cv. Romalinda and 50 plants of cv. Augusta). The
   fruit products were evaluated in three harvesting dates, every two
   weeks, from July to August. The following parameters were evaluated:
   number of fruits; total yield; fruit fresh weight; skin thickness; fruit
   perimeter; fruit height and width; sugar contents; dry matter (DM),
   protein (P), fat (G) and organic matter (OM). The adaptation of the
   seedless cultivar was excellent. There were no significant differences
   between the evaluated parameters and the blocks. The plants produced 3-4
   fruits per plant with a weight between 3.7 and 4.2 Kg. The sugar
   contents increased from the first to the last harvest date, reaching an
   average value of 11.53. Dry matter was higher than on the seeded
   watermelon, reaching 6.23\% (+/- 1,34) (P>0,05), on average for a median
   value of 6.24\% (+/- 1,28) (P<0,05) P, 0.29\% (+/- 0,16) (P>0,05) G and
   92.47\% (+/- 4,52) (P>0,05) OM in dry matter. It can be concluded that
   the cv. Romalinda showed better quantitative and qualitative
   characteristics than the cv. Augusta, being promising as an alternative
   late crop for the region.}},

Abstract = {{The use of the graft in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) has been used to
   avoid problems because of the vascular fungus Fusarium oxysporum.
   Recently, they have been appeared other health problems such as nematode
   attack, Melon necrotic spot virus (MNSV) and other problems that can be
   reduced with the right choice of the rootstock.
   In outdoor crops, they were analyzed different rootstocks: interspecific
   hybrids of Cucurbita maxima x C. moschata, C. moschata, Lagenaria
   siceraria and Citrullus lanatus. The cultivars used in this experiment
   were `Babba', as triploid cultivar and `Pata negra' as diploid cv.
   (pollinator). It was compared the behavior of 8 rootstocks and a control
   without grafting.
   It has been detected a very high incidence of nematodes in this
   experience. Therefore, they were analyzed production parameters and the
   response of the plant in terms of viguor, mortality rate and nodulation
   index of the roots due to nematodes.
   The main plant health problem was the presence of nematodes, whose
   incidence was lower in the watermelon rootstock cv. Robusta and in the
   control without grafting. Although the largest commercial yield and the
   average weight of the fruit was achieved by the hybrid rootstocks of
   pumpkin (C. maxima x C. moschata).}},

Abstract = {{To trace the fate of individual pollen grains through pollination
   processes, we determined genotypes of single pollen grains deposited on
   Hemerocallis stigmas in an experimental mixed-species array.
   Hemerocallis fulva, pollinated by butterflies, has diurnal, reddish and
   unscented flowers, and H. citrina, pollinated by hawkmoths, has
   nocturnal, yellowish and sweet scent flowers. We observed pollinator
   visits to an experimental array of 24 H. fulva and 12 F2 hybrids between
   the two species (H. fulva and H. citrina) and collected stigmas after
   every trip bout of swallowtail butterflies or hawkmoths. We then
   measured selection by swallowtail butterflies or hawkmoths through male
   and female components of pollination success as determined by single
   pollen genotyping. As expected, swallowtail butterflies imposed
   selection on reddish color and weak scent: the number of outcross pollen
   grains acquired is a quadratic function of flower color with the maximum
   at reddish color, and the combined pollination success was maximal at
   weak scent (almost unrecognizable for human). This explains why H.
   fulva, with reddish flowers and no recognizable scent, is mainly
   pollinated by swallowtail butterflies. However, we found no evidence of
   hawkmoths-mediated selection on flower color or scent. Our findings do
   not support a hypothesis that yellow flower color and strong scent
   intensity, the distinctive floral characteristics of H. citrina, having
   evolved in adaptations to hawkmoths. We suggest that the key trait that
   triggers the evolution of nocturnal flowers is flowering time rather
   than flower color and scent.}},

Abstract = {{Seedlessness is one of the main requirements for the Citrus fresh
   market. `Afourer' mandarin has been registered as self-incompatible,
   producing seedless fruit in the absence of cross-pollination. Under
   field conditions, a high number of seeded fruits is produced, which
   reduces its quality and commercial value. The purpose of this work was
   to characterize self-incompatibility type of `Afourer' mandarin, to
   determine its parthenocarpic capacity, and to reduce the presence of
   seeds under field conditions. Four experiments were performed, including
   net-covered trees during flowering period (experiments 1 and 2), single
   flower emasculation and self-pollination (experiment 3), in vivo pollen
   germination, pollen tube development and ovule viability (experiment 1),
   and field application of copper sulfate (CuSO4) and gibberellic acid
   (GA(3)) during flowering period (experiment 4); open pollination was the
   control in all situations. Under open pollination, relatively low
   seedless fruit percentage was found (7\% and 34\%), whereas with
   anti-bee nets this percentage reached 98-99\% of the fruits. Relatively
   high fruit set percentage and fruit number per tree was found in
   net-covered trees and in bagged or emasculated flowers, indicating that
   `Afourer' mandarin presents facultative parthenocarpy. Emasculated or
   self-pollinated flowers resulted in similar seedless fruit number,
   indicating an autonomous parthenocarpy. In flowers from open or
   net-covered trees, similar pollen tube growth was registered until 6
   days after anthesis, but, thereafter, growth was interrupted in
   self-pollination condition, reaching only 40\% of the style length,
   which suggests a gametophytic self-incompatibility system. GA(3) applied
   during flowering period reduced the percentage of seeded fruits and seed
   number per fruit; the most efficient treatment was three applications of
   GA(3) (50 mg l(-1)) combined with CuSO4 (25 mgl(-1)), that increased
   seedless fruit from 19\% to 31\% and reduced from 3.7 to 2.3 the number
   of seeds per fruit. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Citrullus lanatus is cultivated in Cote d'Ivoire for its edible kernels
   which are used as a soup thickener. There are four distinct cultivars
   (one Bebu and three Wlewle). A better understanding of the reproduction
   system for those annual monoecious cultivars may improve its production.
   We studied the impact of pollen load, pollen source and diversity on the
   yield of fruits and seeds.
   Various pollination treatments were applied during four growing seasons
   to assess pollen load, pollen source and diversity (cross pollination
   with single source, cross pollination with multiple sources, self
   pollination and natural pollination) and pollen mixture. Pollination and
   reproductive success were determined by a fertilization index and by
   assessing fruits and seeds production. The self-compatibility and
   inbreeding depression index were also evaluated.
   Higher or lower pollen quantity decreases fertilization success of
   fruits and seeds production while medium pollen load leads to optimal
   yield. All cultivars were self compatible and higher level of inbreeding
   depression had been observed. When cross pollinated, yield was higher
   than natural pollination and self pollination yield. With manual
   pollination, cross pollination with multiple sources produces more
   fruits and seeds resulting in increased yield. Pollen diversity also
   improves fruits and seeds production. Pollen mixture will increase yield
   if the proportion of cross pollen in the mixture is higher than self
   pollen proportion.
   In conclusion, fruits and seeds production of those local self
   compatible cultivars were influenced by the amount of pollen load,
   pollen source and diversity, and also by proportion of pollen type in
   the pollen mixture.
   These results are therefore necessary in order to predict the
   evolutionary trajectory of mating systems and to make plant breeding
   program. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of extending vase life of cut dahlia flowers, we
   investigated the postharvest characteristics of the flowers. Our focus
   was on the role of ethylene on senescence and on treatments that have
   extended vase life of other flowers. Continuous exposure to ethylene at
   2 or 10 mu L L-1 significantly accelerated petal abscission in cut
   flowers. Flowers continuously immersed in 1 or 10 mu L L-1
   2-chloroethylphosphonic acid (CEPA) solution wilted earlier than those
   treated with distilled water (DW) or 0.15 g L-1 citric acid. Ethylene
   production from the ovary and ray petal was relatively high (4.5 and 0.9
   nL g(-1) fresh weight h(-1), respectively) at harvest, but decreased
   gradually over 5 days. No remarkable increase in ethylene production was
   observed during senescence. Silver thiosulfate complex (STS), an
   inhibitor of ethylene action, did not extend the vase life of cut
   flowers, although a high silver concentration was detected in flower
   organs. In contrast, pulse treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP)
   and dip treatment with 6-benzylaminopurine (BA) extended the vase life
   of florets, and BA was more effective than 1-MCP when the flowers were
   held in both DW and CEPA. BA spray treatment extended vase life of cut
   `Kokucho,' `Kamakura' and `Michan' flowers. These results suggest that
   dahlia flower senescence is partially regulated by ethylene, and BA is
   more effective in delaying the senescence of cut dahlia flowers than
   ethylene action inhibitors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The expansion of urban areas is occurring globally, but not all city
   neighborhoods are gaining population. Because of economic decline and
   the recent foreclosure crisis, many U. S. cities are demolishing
   abandoned residential structures to create parcels of vacant land. In
   some cities, weak housing markets have, or will likely, recover in the
   near term, and these parcels will be redeveloped. However, in other
   cities, large numbers of abandoned parcels have no significant market
   value and no likelihood of near-term redevelopment. The creation of
   these vacated green spaces could offer opportunities to preserve
   declining species, restore ecosystem functions, and support diverse
   ecosystem services. Arthropods are an important indicator of the ability
   of urban vacant land to serve multiple functions, from conservation to
   food production. Across Europe, vacant lands have been found to support
   a diversity of rare species, and similar examinations of arthropods
   within this habitat are underway in the United States. In addition,
   using vacant land as a resource for local food production is growing
   rapidly worldwide. Arthropods play key roles in the sustainability of
   food production in cities, and land conversion to farming has been found
   to influence their community composition and function. A greater focus
   on quantifying the current ecological value of vacant land and further
   assessment of how changes in its ecosystem management affect
   biodiversity and ecosystem processes is clearly needed. Herein, we
   specifically focus on the role of arthropods in addressing these
   priorities to advance our ecological understanding of the functional
   role of vacant land habitats in cities.}},

Abstract = {{This study compares phenological observations of Corylus (hazel) and
   Alnus (alder) flowering with airborne pollen counts of these taxa
   recorded using volumetric spore traps (2009-2011). The work was carried
   out in the Polish cities of Szczecin and Rzeszw that are located in
   different climatic regions. Correlations between pollen concentrations
   and meteorological data were investigated using Spearman's rank
   correlation analysis. The timings of hazel and alder pollination and the
   occurrence of airborne pollen varied greatly and were significantly
   influenced by meteorological conditions (p < 0.05). The flowering
   synchronization of hazel and alder pollination in Szczecin and Rzeszw
   varied over the study period. Hazel and alder trees flowered notably
   earlier in stands located in places that were exposed to sunlight
   (insolated) and sheltered from the wind. On the other hand, a delay in
   the timing of pollination was observed in quite sunny but very windy
   sites. In Rzeszw, maximum hazel pollen concentrations did not coincide
   with the period of full pollination (defined as between 25 \% hazel and
   alder and 75 \% of flowers open). Conversely, in Szczecin, the highest
   hazel pollen concentrations were recorded during phenophases of the full
   pollination period. The period when the highest alder pollen
   concentrations were recorded varied between sites, with Rzeszw recording
   the highest concentrations at the beginning of pollination and Szczecin
   recording alder pollen throughout the full pollination period.
   Substantial amounts of hazel and alder pollen grains were recorded in
   the air of Rzeszw (but not Szczecin) before the onset of the respective
   pollen seasons.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to identify the reproductive phenology and the
   pollination and dispersal syndromes of understory species of
   Semi-deciduous Dry Forest. The work was carried out from May 2010 to May
   2011 in a forest fragment, about 29 hectares, localized in Catalao city,
   Goias State, Brazil. The phenological phases were observed weekly along
   a transect at 1000m. Pollination and dispersion syndromes were
   determined through literature data, and theses data were linked to
   phenology. The flowering proportion reached the peak (43,13\%) in
   December 2010 (rainy) and fruiting (30\%) in September 2010 (dry).
   Acanthaceae flowering peak in May 2010 and February 2011; Piperaceae
   peaked in October 2010 and Rubiaceae in December 2010. Fruiting in the
   Acanthaceae occurred during the dry period and the beginning of the
   rainy season, with the highest incidence in October 2010, Piperaceae
   reached their peak in May 2011, while in the Rubiaceae, it went on for
   11 months, with the highest incidence being in March 2011. Two
   Acanthaceae and one Piperaceae species not fruited, but all species
   presented flowering. Pollination syndromes found were Ornithophily,
   peaking in May 2010, Melittophily, in October 2010, and Psycophily, in
   January 2011. Dispersal syndromes found were Anemochoric, with a higher
   incidence in October 2010, and Ornithocoric with two peaks, one in July
   2010 and other in May 2011. The year-long presence of flowering and/or
   fruiting species contributes to the survival and dynamics of the
   community studied, because these species play an important role
   maintaining bees and birds in the fragment, which are important vectors
   of pollination and dispersal, respectively. Considering the rapid loss
   of the Cerrado vegetation in recent times and the study site to be a
   fragment localized inside the urban environment, the conservation of the
   green area becomes important, regardless of its small size, due to the
   important ecological processes that lie therein, as portrayed in this
   study.}},

Abstract = {{This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of
   Robinia pseudoacacia L. that are relevant to understanding its
   ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented
   within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British
   Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors,
   responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral
   and seed characters, herbivores and disease, and history and
   conservation.Robinia pseudoacacia, false acacia or black locust, is a
   deciduous, broad-leaved tree native to North America. The medium-sized,
   fast-growing tree is armed with spines, and extensively suckering. It
   has become naturalized in grassland, semi-natural woodlands and urban
   habitats. The tree is common in the south of the British Isles and in
   many other regions of Europe.Robinia pseudoacacia is a light-demanding
   pioneer species, which occurs primarily in disturbed sites on fertile to
   poor soils. The tree does not tolerate wet or compacted soils. In
   contrast to its native range, where it rapidly colonizes forest gaps and
   is replaced after 15-30years by more competitive tree species,
   populations in the secondary range can persist for a longer time,
   probably due to release from natural enemies.Robinia pseudoacacia
   reproduces sexually, and asexually by underground runners. Disturbance
   favours clonal growth and leads to an increase in the number of ramets.
   Mechanical stem damage and fires also lead to increased clonal
   recruitment. The tree benefits from di-nitrogen fixation associated with
   symbiotic rhizobia in root nodules. Estimated symbiotic nitrogen
   fixation rates range widely from 23 to 300kgha(-1)year(-1). The nitrogen
   becomes available to other plants mainly by the rapid decay of
   nitrogen-rich leaves.Robinia pseudoacacia is host to a wide range of
   fungi both in the native and introduced ranges. Megaherbivores are of
   minor significance in Europe but browsing by ungulates occurs in the
   native range. Among insects, the North American black locust gall midge
   (Obolodiplosis robiniae) is specific to Robinia and is spreading rapidly
   throughout Europe. In parts of Europe, Robinia pseudoacacia is
   considered an invasive non-indigenous plant and the tree is controlled.
   Negative impacts include shading and changes of soil conditions as a
   result of nitrogen fixation.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of plant species rely, at least partly, on animals for
   pollination. Our knowledge on whether pollinator visitation differs
   between native and alien plant species, and between invasive and
   non-invasive alien species is still limited. Additionally, because
   numerous invasive plant species are escapees from horticulture, the
   transition from human-assisted occurrence in urbanized habitats to
   unassisted persistence and spread in (semi-)natural habitats requires
   study. To address whether pollinator visitation differs between native,
   invasive alien and non-invasive alien species, we did pollinator
   observations for a total of 17 plant species representing five plant
   families. To test whether pollinator visitation to the three groups of
   species during the initial stage of invasion depends on habitat type, we
   did the study in three urbanized habitats and three semi-natural
   grasslands, using single potted plants. Native plants had more but
   smaller flower units than alien plants, and invasive alien plants had
   more but smaller flowers than non-invasive alien plants. After
   accounting for these differences in floral display, pollinator
   visitation was higher for native than for alien plant species, but did
   not differ between invasive and non-invasive alien plant species.
   Pollinator visitation was on average higher in semi-natural than in
   urbanized habitats, irrespective of origin or status of the plant
   species. This might suggest that once an alien species has managed to
   escape from urbanized into more natural habitats, pollinator limitation
   will not be a major barrier to establishment and invasion.}},

Abstract = {{Sugar content largely determines watermelon fruit quality. We compared
   changes in sugar accumulation and activities of carbohydrate enzymes in
   the flesh (central portion) and mesocarp of elite sweet watermelon line
   97103 (Citrullus lanatus subsp. vulgaris) and exotic non-sweet line
   PI296341-FR (C. lanatus subsp. lanatus) to elucidate the physiological
   and biochemical mechanisms of sugar accumulation in watermelon fruit.
   The major translocated sugars, raffinose and stachyose, were more
   unloaded into sweet watermelon fruit than non-sweet fruit. During the
   fruit development, acid alpha-galactosidase activity was much higher in
   flesh of 97103 than in mesocarp of 97103, in flesh and mesocarp of
   PI296341-FR fruit. Insoluble acid invertase activity was higher in 97103
   flesh than in 97103 mesocarp, PI296341-FR flesh or mesocarp from 18 days
   after pollination (DAP) to 34 DAP. Changes in soluble acid invertase
   activity in 97103 flesh were similar to those in PI296341-FR flesh and
   mesocarp from 18 DAP to full ripening. Sucrose synthase and sucrose
   phosphate synthase activities in 97103 flesh were significantly higher
   than those in 97103 mesocarp and PI296341-FR fruits from 18 to 34 DAP.
   Only insoluble acid invertase and sucrose phosphate synthase activities
   were significantly positively correlated with sucrose content in 97103
   flesh. Therefore, phloem loading, distribution and metabolism of major
   translocated sugars, which are controlled by key sugar metabolism
   enzymes, determine fruit sugar accumulation in sweet and non-sweet
   watermelon and reflect the distribution diversity of translocated sugars
   between subspecies.}},

Title = {{Pistil Starch Reserves at Anthesis Correlate with Final Flower Fate in
   Avocado (Persea americana)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{A common observation in different plant species is a massive abscission
   of flowers and fruitlets even after adequate pollination, but little is
   known as to the reason for this drop. Previous research has shown the
   importance of nutritive reserves accumulated in the flower on
   fertilization success and initial fruit development but direct evidence
   has been elusive. Avocado (Persea americana) is an extreme case of a
   species with a very low fruit to flower ratio. In this work, the
   implications of starch content in the avocado flower on the subsequent
   fruit set are explored. Firstly, starch content in individual ovaries
   was analysed from two populations of flowers with a different fruit set
   capacity showing that the flowers from the population that resulted in a
   higher percentage of fruit set contained significantly more starch.
   Secondly, in a different set of flowers, the style of each flower was
   excised one day after pollination, once the pollen tubes had reached the
   base of the style, and individually fixed for starch content analysis
   under the microscope once the fate of its corresponding ovary (that
   remained in the tree) was known. A high variability in starch content in
   the style was found among flowers, with some flowers having starch
   content up to 1,000 times higher than others, and the flowers that
   successfully developed into fruits presented significantly higher starch
   content in the style at anthesis than those that abscised. The
   relationship between starch content in the ovary and the capacity of set
   of the flower together with the correlation found between the starch
   content in the style and the fate of the ovary support the hypothesis
   that the carbohydrate reserves accumulated in the flower at anthesis are
   related to subsequent abscission or retention of the developing fruit.}},

Abstract = {{Hummingbirds are the main vertebrate pollinators in the Neotropics, but
   little is known about the interactions between hummingbirds and flowers
   in areas of Cerrado. This paper aims to describe the interactions
   between flowering plants (ornithophilous and non-ornithophilous species)
   and hummingbirds in an urban Cerrado remnant. For this purpose, we
   investigated which plant species are visited by hummingbirds, which
   hummingbird species occur in the area, their visiting frequency and
   behavior, their role as legitimate or illegitimate visitors, as well as
   the number of agonistic interactions among these visitors. Sampling was
   conducted throughout 18 months along a track located in an urban
   fragment of Cerrado vegetation in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul,
   Brasil. We found 15 species of plants visited by seven species of
   hummingbirds. The main habit for ornithophilous species was herbaceous,
   with the predominance of Bromeliaceae; among non-ornithophilous most
   species were trees from the families Vochysiaceae and Malvaceae.
   Hylocharis chrysura was the hummingbird that visited the largest number
   of plant species and also attended the greater number of agonistic
   events. The high proportion (66.7\%) of non-ornithophilous species
   visited by hummingbirds in the present study was similar to that found
   in other communities analyzed in Brazil. The fact that ornithophilous
   species in the area does not offer resources continuously throughout the
   year should induce hummingbirds to search for alternative resources, and
   contribute to the high proportion of non-ornithophilous species visited.
   In general, the floral form was not a barrier to floral visits by
   hummingbirds, although morphological characteristics of flowers from
   some plant species may be restrictive. Tabebuia aurea, for example,
   presents flowers with long corollas, hindering the access to floral
   resources by the pollinators, what may favor the occurrence of
   illegitimate visits by hummingbirds. Despite of being a small fragment
   of Cerrado vegetation, the studied remnant can be considered an
   important refuge, sheltering a great richness of hummingbird species
   comparable to several forested areas in Brazil.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological studies on native bees in urban tropical environments are
   rare, however, ever-increasing urban areas world-wide necessitate study
   on how many of these bees can and have adjusted to human constructs.
   Predictable ecological patterns that emerge from these studies can
   provide guidance on how future urban constructs can be designed to
   provide habitat for conserving and protecting native bees. These
   patterns can also be used for bee habitat restoration in natural and
   agricultural environments. An extensive survey of native bees and honey
   bees and their relationships to a community of 102 plant types in urban
   residential environments of Bagaces and Liberia in northwestern Costa
   Rica was conducted from 2003-2012. Bees were attracted and recorded at
   measurable frequencies to 82 plant genera in 41 families, the most
   common of which was Fabaceae. Forty-two plant types were native
   ornamentals; 39 were non-natives; and 21 were native weed species.
   Standardized bee visitation (frequency) counts, 17,000+, were used to
   record relationships between bees and flowers. The following data were
   recorded for each plant type: flowering phenology in months, type of
   floral reward(s) (pollen, nectar, and/or oil), main daily attraction
   period, and most frequently visiting bee taxa. Plant life forms included
   trees, shrubs, lianas/vines, herbs, and palms. Each plant group had a
   different seasonal flowering phenology with native ornamentals and
   native weeds having patterns that closely resembled the general patterns
   for wild plants in the dry forest. Predictable associations of certain
   bee taxa with each plant type emerged from the count data, which allowed
   for categorizing relationships into four types: small bee, diverse bee,
   specialized bee, and nocturnal pollination systems. Intraspecific
   variations in bee attraction to several plant types were also noted.
   Honey bees (Africanized) did not figure prominently in most pollination
   relationships, especially with regard to native plants. Most native bee
   species were generalized foragers. Beyond the urban environment, it is
   suggested that knowledge of predictable bee-flower relationships can
   also be used to restore bee habitat in disturbed environments such as
   deforested areas. With some imagination and outreach education, bee
   habitats could also be installed for some agricultural crops.
   Outreaching information on native bee-flower relationships at local,
   regional, and state levels is important for short and long-term
   propagation of urban (and agricultural) plants. Yet, very few outlets
   for transferring this knowledge currently exist in Costa Rica. A few
   limited options for sharing this information are discussed, including
   collaborative partnerships with local NGOs.}},

Abstract = {{Plant species and their pollinators are linked by their mutualistic
   interactions, which form the basis of pollination networks. The use of a
   network approach allows one to take into account all interactions
   between a group of plants and its animal pollinators, and to reveal the
   structure of these connections. We analysed pollination interactions for
   urban habitat fragments located within the Warsaw city environment. We
   compared two similar, ruderal communities (phytosociological order
   Onopordetalia acanthii) located in distant parts of the city of Warsaw
   (Poland) that differed with the surrounding ecosystems. The aim of this
   study was to define the structures and properties of flower-visitor
   (visitation) and pollen transport networks (based on analysis of pollen
   loads carried by insects) and to assess the differences between the
   studied sites. Although the sites differed in insect relative abundance
   (Diptera dominated one study site, whereas Hymenoptera dominated the
   other), network size and structure were similar for both communities. In
   both cases, networks contained moderately specialized species (based on
   H (2)' index); however, networks were dominated by apparently
   ecologically generalized insect taxa as well as those represented by a
   single specimen. Networks based on pollen transport indicated greater
   generality of insect species (more links) than those based on our
   samples of visitation. The most highly linked plant species represented
   were either the most abundant (Fabaceae) or phenotypically generalized
   taxa (Daucus carota). We conclude that plant-pollinator interactions in
   such highly disturbed and isolated habitats are composed mostly of
   ecologically generalised species. Moreover, we stress the usefulness of
   pollen load analysis in the development and verification of visitation
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Retention of habitat fragments within the urban matrix can provide
   critical resources for the maintenance of regional biodiversity while
   still providing socio-economic value. Euglossini bees are important
   components in a community as they are important pollinators for
   economically valuable plants as well as hundreds of orchid species.
   However, some species are very sensitive to environmental impacts like
   urbanization. This study presents the role of antique urban fragments in
   a historical city in Brazil and compares it with a conservation area on
   the aspects of orchid bee assemblage, such as richness, composition, and
   abundance. Four fragments inside the city of Ouro Preto and three inside
   Parque Estadual do Itacolomi (PEIT) were sampled for Euglossini bees.
   Sorensen similarity index was used to compare community composition. The
   Mantel test was applied to verify the hypothesis that an urban center is
   a barrier for the mobility of the individuals. Fourteen Euglossini
   species from the region were registered. Close to 75\% of the sampled
   bees were collected from the PEIT sampling areas. The fragments
   presented differences in Euglossini richness and abundance. A majority
   of the sampled fragments were dominated by the Eulaema cingulata
   Fabricius, Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier, and Euglossa securigera Dressler
   species. We found differences on community composition between the
   fragments localized in PEIT and those located in the urban center. The
   data suggest that there is a possible flux of individuals between the
   sampled fragments. The various small forest fragments in Ouro Preto,
   primarily in backyards, may also serve as stepping stones between
   sampled fragments.}},

Abstract = {{Self-incompatibility (SI) is one important factor that can result in
   seedless fruits of Citrus. Our previous study showed that
   `Wuzishatangju' mandarin was gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) and
   72 h was the crucial stage for the shift from a self-compatible to a
   self-incompatible state. However, it is not clear what genes are
   involved in the process. In this study, two SSH libraries were
   constructed to screen differentially expressed genes using 72 h styles
   after self-pollination of `Wuzishatangju' and cross-pollination of
   `Wuzishatangju' x `Shatangju'. 106 and 97 differentially expressed cDNA
   clones were sequenced and identified from forward and reverse SSH
   libraries, respectively. Differentially expressed ESTs are possibly
   involved in the SI reaction of `Wuzishatangju' through S-phase
   kinase-associated protein1 (SKP1)-like activity, autoinhibited
   Ca2+-ATPase 1, U-box domain protein, and serine/threonine kinase.
   Results from quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) showed that SKP1 -like
   and U-box were obviously up-regulated in ovaries before pollination of
   `Wuzishatangju', and approximately 20- and 2-fold higher than that of
   `Shatangju', respectively. The SKP1 -like and U-box were obviously
   up-regulated in pistils at 4 d after self-pollination of
   `Wuzishatangju', and approximately 20- and 800-fold higher than that the
   same stage after cross-pollination of `Wuzishatangju' x `Shatangju',
   respectively. The potential involvement of these genes in the SI
   reaction is discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   citrus rootstocks. Embryos from the seeds of mature fruits were rescued
   and individually cultured in vitro. On average, 9.0-10.0 embryos per
   seed were harvested from the two crosses. The zygotic seedlings were
   only derived from large- to medium-sized embryos. The small embryos were
   not able to germinate or develop into seedlings. The numbers of
   seedlings per seed produced from the two crosses were similar, ranging
   from 1 to 11 and 1 to 14, at average of 4.17 and 4.90, respectively,

   from P. trifoliata was used as a morphological marker to discriminate
   hybrid from nucellar seedlings. Of 43 and 14 zygotic seedlings were
   obtained from 98 and 65 seeds of the two crosses, respectively. In
   addition to the use of morphological marker, single nucleotide
   polymorphism based allele specific PCR (AS-PCR) was also successfully
   employed as a handy tool to confirm and identify zygotic seedlings.

   present in the study area, located at the Universidade de Sao Paulo,

   distributed throughout the year. Concurrently, worker bees with pollen
   loads were collected from four colonies of Frieseomelitta varia
   (Lepeletier, 1836) to identify the sources used by bees. Despite an
   increase in plant species abundance in July, plants were in bloom
   year-round and consequently, the production and supply of floral
   resources were continuous. The workers collected resources from 77 plant
   species, but only three were extensively exploited. Delonix regia
   (Leguminosae), Poincianella pluviosa (Leguminosae) and Ceiba speciosa
   (Malvaceae) accounted for 42\% of total pollen grains quantified during
   the year, showing that F. varia intensify pollen collection at few
   sources at spatiotemporal scale. This study emphasizes the importance of
   native urban flora to maintain F. varia and other bee species. The list
   of plants presented in this study can be used in the design and planning

Abstract = {{The study goals were to investigate the flowering phenology, the floral
   biology, and the floral visitors of Calatheacrocata. The data was
   collected in an understory fragment of Atlantic Forest at Igrapiuna
   city, state of Bahia. Field expeditions were conducted by month from
   July 2009 to August 2011. Every month flowering phenology data was
   documented. Besides floral morphometry, volume and concentration of
   nectar data, the floral attributes of C. crocata were collected.
   Hummingbird species that visited the plant was registered by focal
   observations in breeding plants from sunrise to sunrise, establishing
   the frequency and forage behavior. Natural pollination and
   self-pollination tests were conducted, in addition to trigger
   efficiency. The breeding season is annual, and has intermediate
   duration, being negatively correlated with the temperature.
   Calatheacrocata is an ornithophilous species; its flowers are tubular,
   with yellow corollas of 24,3mm of length average, and 2,6mm of aperture
   average. The nectar has a sugar's concentration average of 21\%, and a
   volume's average production of 9,4 mu l. The flowers were visited
   legitimately by four hummingbird species. The visits frequency was 0,69
   visits per inflorescence/hour, all of them were able to release the
   trigger. Phaethornisruber was the mainly pollen vector of C. crocata.
   Calatheacrocata is an allogamous species, and is not capable of
   spontaneous self-pollination: just the natural pollination test produced
   fruits. More specific features, as the trigger reduction, visible in
   this species, can be an evolutionary evidence from melitophily to
   ornithophily already seen in Marantaceae family, but not too noted on
   the genre.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on nesting ecology have proven to be extremely important for
   stingless bees conservation. This kind of study is scarce in urban
   landscapes. Our study aimed to analyze the abundance, density,
   diversity, spatial distribution and nesting habits of species belonging
   to the Meliponina subtribe in an urban area of the Uberlandia
   municipality, Minas Gerais state. We checked potential nesting sites by
   searching for nests from October 2009 until April 2010. We collected six
   worker bees from each detected nest to identify species, and estimated
   diversity and analyzed the spatial distribution pattern of the nests
   using the Shannon-Wiener and Nearest Neighbor index, respectively. We
   found fifty nests belonging to seven species, with Nannotrigona
   testaceicornis being the most abundant species (44\%). The density of
   nests was 2.17 nests/ha, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index was H'=1.58
   and the clumped distribution was the detected dispersal pattern. The
   height of the nests in relation to the ground varied from 0 to 12 m:
   Trigona spinipes had the highest nests and the highest variation for
   this parameter. Hollow trees were the preferred substrate occupied by
   the observed bees species (70\%): Caesalpinia peltophoroides was the
   preferred plant species for nesting. Our results suggested that urban
   landscapes can sustain a high diversity of stingless bees, and
   maintaining trees species and urban forestry projects are important
   tools for the conservation of this group of animals. This type of study
   provides relevant information to the development of management and
   conservation plans for Meliponina species.}},

Abstract = {{Calcareous grasslands are among the most species-rich plant communities
   in Europe with a particularly high nature conservation value. During the
   past centuries their distribution has markedly decreased, at least
   partly due to urbanization. Thus we investigated the effects of
   urbanization on species diversity along a spatio-temporal urbanization
   gradient from traditionally managed grassland to areas affected by urban
   developments, which was situated in the plains northwest of Munich,
   Germany. Both a RLQ analysis linking species and environmental traits,
   and a redundancy analysis of the plant community features showed that
   soil disturbance, soil sealing and mean temperature explained most of
   the environmental variation along the gradient. The species in urban
   habitats showed increased insect pollination, earlier flowering and
   prolonged seed longevity. While urbanization favored short-lived species
   with dysochorous dispersal, the reference grasslands harbored more
   wind-pollinated perennials with effective vegetative spread and
   relatively large, short-lived seeds. Compared to the urban sites,
   traditionally used grasslands had a higher species diversity, more
   threatened species and a lower proportion of non-natives. We conclude
   that even under conservation management, urban habitats are not capable
   of maintaining the original biodiversity. However, we also found
   threatened species occurring exclusively in urban sites. Hence,
   urbanization decreased the area and diversity of traditional calcareous
   grasslands, but it also established niches for endangered species which
   are not adapted to the living conditions in calcareous grasslands.}},

Journal = {{URBAN ECOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Few studies directly address the consequences of habitat fragmentation
   for pollinating insect communities, particularly for the neotropical key
   pollinator group of stingless bees. Most studies on bees have defined
   habitat fragments as remnant patches of floral hosts or forests,
   overlooking the nesting needs of bees. Their conclusion is that habitat
   fragmentation is broadly deleterious; however, there are contrasting
   results in the literature. Insightful studies on habitat fragmentation
   and bees should consider fragmentation, alteration and loss of nesting
   habitats-not just patches of forage plants -, as well as the
   permeability of the surrounding matrix to interpatch movement. Here we
   investigated the effects of fragmentation caused by urbanization on
   stingless bee species' composition and richness, as well as the
   permeability of the surrounding matrix. We collected bees from flowering
   plants and recorded phytosociological variables of five forest remnants
   (ranging from 64 ha to 900 ha) in southeastern Brazil. Large fragments
   did not contain more species per unit area than smaller ones; in fact,
   we found more species in small fragments, most of which were generalist
   bees. The presence of more habitat generalist stingless bee species was
   also correlated to the structure of vegetation in these fragments. In
   conclusion, the quality of the habitat within a fragment (structure of
   vegetation) as well as the quality of the matrix has a direct relation
   to the bee species composition. This can be seen in the direct
   relationship between structural diversity of the environment and age of
   the fragments. The matrix that holds the most recent fragments, probably
   due to the sprawl of the city, is more heterogeneous than the one with
   the oldest fragments. The most heterogeneous matrices have a certain
   balance between the trees, buildings and bare soil or herbaceous
   vegetation coverage, making the array less impermeable to bees.}},

Abstract = {{Parietaria pollen has never been considered as a significant cause of
   pollinosis in Chile; therefore, the sensitization to Parietaria study
   has never been included in the study of patients with clinical suspicion
   of pollinosis in this region. The objective of this study was to
   describe the clinical characteristics of pollinosis caused by Parietaria
   in the Valparaiso region, related to air concentrations of this kind of
   pollen. A cross-sectional study was performed in the city of Valparaiso.
   It consisted of two stages: In the first, pollen grains were counted
   between 1999 and 2001. In the second, a sensitization profile on a
   patient population diagnosed with ARC (allergic rhinoconjunctivitis) was
   evaluated. Parietaria judaica (P. judiaca) presented pollination all
   year long, with aggravation in the spring and summer, and with values
   reaching 80 grains/m(3) (weekly average). These findings determined the
   transience of the symptoms in this population, which is mainly perennial
   with seasonal aggravations. A total of 72 atopic subjects were obtained
   during the whole sample recollection period. P. judaica was the second
   most frequent cause of sensitization (60 \%) after Dermatophagoides in
   the sample overall. Also, in monosensitized subjects, it was the first
   cause of pollen sensitization. P. judaica represents the second cause of
   allergy in Valparaiso and the first cause of pollinosis. These findings
   suggest the importance of quantifying Parietaria in Valparaiso and near
   cities, plus investigating the presence of sensitization and symptoms to
   allergies in a significant proportion of patients in this region.}},

Title = {{Why flower visitation is a poor proxy for pollination: measuring

   networks and conservation}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. The relative importance of specialized and generalized
   plant-pollinator relationships is contentious, yet analyses usually
   avoid direct measures of pollinator quality (effectiveness), citing
   difficulties in collecting such data in the field and so relying on
   visitation data alone.
   2. We demonstrate that single-visit deposition (SVD) of pollen on virgin
   stigmas is a practical measure of pollinator effectiveness, using 13
   temperate and tropical plant species. For each flower the most effective
   pollinator measured from SVD was as predicted from its pollination
   syndrome based on traditional advertisement and reward traits. Overall,
   c.40\% of visitors were not effective pollinators (range 0-78\% for
   different flowers); thus, flower-pollinator relationships are
   substantially more specialized than visitation alone can reveal.
   3. Analyses at species level are crucial, as significant variation in
   SVD occurred within both higher-level taxonomic groups (genus, family)
   and within functional groups.
   4. Other measures sometimes used to distinguish visitors from
   pollinators (visit duration, frequency, or feeding behaviour in flowers)
   did not prove to be suitable proxies.
   5. Distinguishing between `pollinators' and `visitors' is therefore
   crucial, and true `pollination networks' should include SVD to reveal
   pollinator effectiveness (PE). Generating such networks, now underway,
   could avoid potential misinterpretations of the conservation values of
   flower visitors, and of possible extinction threats as modelled in
   existing networks.}},

Abstract = {{Introduced pollinator species may exacerbate the problems faced by
   pollinator communities, so the detection in 2006 of a new solitary bee,
   Anthidium manicatum, to New Zealand was concerning. We assess whether
   establishment of this wool-carder bee presents potential risks to native
   flora and fauna by recording its current distribution, which plant
   species it visits, which insects co-occur at these plants, and
   identifying which species this territorial bee attacks. Anthidium
   manicatum is now widespread in urban New Zealand. More than 80\% of the
   plants visited by A. manicatum were exotic species (predominantly
   Lamiaceae and Plantaginaceae), although it also visited native species
   of Veronica (Plantaginaceae) and Lobelia (Campanulaceae). Anthidium
   manicatum primarily interacted with other introduced bees. Native
   Lasioglossum bees were seldom attacked and only for short durations.
   Further research is required, particularly on weeds, but we suggest that
   A. manicatum does not present a major direct threat to New Zealand's
   native flora and fauna.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the natural mating behavior (self- or cross-pollination)
   in watermelon is important to the design of a suitable breeding
   strategy. The objective of this study was to measure the rate of self-
   and cross-pollination in watermelon {[}Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)
   Matsum. \& Nakai] using the dominant gene Sp (Spotted leaves and fruit)
   as a marker. The experiment consisted of two studies and was a split
   plot in a randomized complete block design with 3 years (2009 to 2011)
   and four locations (Clinton, Kinston, Oxford, Lewiston, NC). For the
   intercrossing study, whole plots were the two spacings (1.2 x 0.3 m and
   1.2 x 0.6 m) with four replications in 2010. For the inbreeding study,
   whole plots were two equidistant spacings (3 x 3 m and 6 x 6 m) with
   four replications in 2009 to 2011. Cultivars Allsweet and Mickylee were
   subplots within each whole plot. In the inbreeding study, spacing and
   year had a significant effect on the rate of self-pollination, which was
   moderate (47\% and 54\%, respectively) when watermelon plants were
   trained in a spiral and spaced 3 x 3 m or 6 x 6 m apart. Spacing and
   cultivar did not have a significant effect on cross-pollination in the
   intercrossing study. Closely spaced watermelon plants (1.2 x 0.3 m and
   1.2 x 0.6 m) had low natural outcrossing rate (31\% and 35\%,
   respectively) and was not adequate to intercross families. However,
   breeders should consider the amount of self-pollination in watermelon to
   calculate the estimates of component of genetic variances.}},

Title = {{REVIEW: Towards a systems approach for understanding honeybee decline: a

Abstract = {{1. The health of managed and wild honeybee colonies appears to have
   declined substantially in Europe and the United States over the last
   decade. Sustainability of honeybee colonies is important not only for
   honey production, but also for pollination of crops and wild plants
   alongside other insect pollinators. A combination of causal factors,
   including parasites, pathogens, land use changes and pesticide usage,
   are cited as responsible for the increased colony mortality. 2. However,
   despite detailed knowledge of the behaviour of honeybees and their
   colonies, there are no suitable tools to explore the resilience
   mechanisms of this complex system under stress. Empirically testing all
   combinations of stressors in a systematic fashion is not feasible. We
   therefore suggest a cross-level systems approach, based on mechanistic
   modelling, to investigate the impacts of (and interactions between)
   colony and land management. 3. We review existing honeybee models that
   are relevant to examining the effects of different stressors on colony
   growth and survival. Most of these models describe honeybee colony
   dynamics, foraging behaviour or honeybee - varroa mite - virus
   interactions. 4. We found that many, but not all, processes within
   honeybee colonies, epidemiology and foraging are well understood and
   described in the models, but there is no model that couples in-hive
   dynamics and pathology with foraging dynamics in realistic landscapes.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We describe how a new integrated model
   could be built to simulate multifactorial impacts on the honeybee colony
   system, using building blocks from the reviewed models. The development
   of such a tool would not only highlight empirical research priorities
   but also provide an important forecasting tool for policy makers and
   beekeepers, and we list examples of relevant applications to bee disease
   and landscape management decisions.}},

Title = {{Do Honeybees Shape the Bacterial Community Composition in Floral Nectar?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Floral nectar is considered the most important reward animal-pollinated
   plants offer to attract pollinators. Here we explore whether honeybees,
   which act as pollinators, affect the composition of bacterial
   communities in the nectar. Nectar and honeybees were sampled from two
   plant species: Amygdalus communis and Citrus paradisi. To prevent the
   contact of nectar with pollinators, C. paradisi flowers were covered
   with net bags before blooming (covered flowers). Comparative analysis of
   bacterial communities in the nectar and on the honeybees was performed
   by the 454-pyrosequencing technique. No significant differences were
   found among bacterial communities in honeybees captured on the two
   different plant species. This resemblance may be due to the presence of
   dominant bacterial OTUs, closely related to the Arsenophonus genus. The
   bacterial communities of the nectar from the covered and uncovered C.
   paradisi flowers differed significantly; the bacterial communities on
   the honeybees differed significantly from those in the covered flowers'
   nectar, but not from those in the uncovered flowers' nectar. We conclude
   that the honeybees may introduce bacteria into the nectar and/or may be
   contaminated by bacteria introduced into the nectar by other sources
   such as other pollinators and nectar thieves.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Maintaining bee-friendly habitats in cities and suburbs can help
   conserve the vital pollination services of declining bee populations.
   Despite label precautions not to apply them to blooming plants,
   neonicotinoids and other residual systemic insecticides may be applied
   for preventive control of lawn insect pests when spring-flowering weeds
   are present. Dietary exposure to neonicotinoids adversely affects bees,
   but the extent of hazard from field usage is controversial. We exposed
   colonies of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens to turf with blooming white
   clover that had been treated with clothianidin, a neonicotinoid, or with
   chlorantraniliprole, the first anthranilic diamide labeled for use on
   lawns. The sprays were applied at label rate and lightly irrigated.
   After residues had dried, colonies were confined to forage for six days,
   and then moved to a non-treated rural site to openly forage and develop.
   Colonies exposed to clothianidin-treated weedy turf had delayed weight
   gain and produced no new queens whereas those exposed to
   chlorantraniliprole-treated plots developed normally compared with
   controls. Neither bumble bees nor honey bees avoided foraging on treated
   white clover in open plots. Nectar from clover blooms directly
   contaminated by spray residues contained 171 +/- 44 ppb clothianidin.
   Notably, neither insecticide adversely impacted bee colonies confined on
   the treated turf after it had been mown to remove clover blooms present
   at the time of treatment, and new blooms had formed. Our results
   validate EPA label precautionary statements not to apply neonicotinoids
   to blooming nectar-producing plants if bees may visit the treatment
   area. Whatever systemic hazard through lawn weeds they may pose appears
   transitory, however, and direct hazard can be mitigated by adhering to
   label precautions, or if blooms inadvertently are contaminated, by
   mowing to remove them. Chlorantraniliprole usage on lawns appears
   non-hazardous to bumble bees.}},

Abstract = {{Citizen science the partnering of scientists with members of the public
   to do research is increasingly utilized in environmental research,
   having been credited with enabling studies that would otherwise be
   cost-prohibitive while promoting scientific literacy and empowering and
   engaging participants in conservation. Although the value of
   citizen-generated data for scientific purposes is increasingly accepted,
   and there is a growing recognition of the role of citizen science in
   developing science literacy, there has been little investigation of its
   link to conservation outcomes particularly in terms of volunteers'
   further engagement in conservation. This paper reviews the literature on
   the relationship between participation in citizen science and
   conservation attitude and behavior changes, and looks at the relevance
   of theoretical models to shed light on possible drivers of such changes.
   We discuss two citizen science projects in the New York metropolitan
   area the Great Pollinator Project and the Earthwatch Coyote Project as
   illustrations of the impact of citizen science on attitudes and
   behaviors as perceived by participants. We offer recommendations for
   further research on facilitating conservation outcomes through citizen

Abstract = {{Over the past century, Israel was a focal point for the improvement of
   local cucurbit landraces and introduction of cucurbit germplasm. Some
   improved open-pollinated cucurbit cultivars developed in Israel became
   established as market types of considerable economic importance far
   beyond its borders. The origin and history of these cultivars is not
   widely known and therefore the purpose of the present work was to
   collect and compare the records relevant to the development of these
   cultivars, and to describe them more fully. The four economically most
   important cultivars originated through mass-selection by amateur
   breeders and were named after their respective farming communities. The
   `Bet Alfa' cucumber (Cucumis sativus) was selected from a local landrace
   and introduced in 1936. The `Malali' watermelon (Citrullus lanatus)
   originated as a rogue in a local landrace and was commercialized around
   1940. The `Ananas Yoqne'am' melon (Cucumis melo) was selected from a
   local landrace and commercialized around 1950. The `Ha'Ogen' melon was
   selected from a cultivar introduced from Hungary and commercialized in
   the 1950s. The outstanding fruit quality of these four cultivars
   resulted in their widespread planting in Israel and neighboring
   countries. Moreover, the quality of the cucumber and melon cultivars
   inspired successive improvements, notably introgression of disease
   resistance and development of hybrids, by Israeli breeder-geneticists.
   The ever-increasing demand for their high-quality fruits established as
   international market types the Bet Alfa cucumber, the Ananas Yoqne'am
   melon, and the Ha'Ogen melon and its derivative, the Galia melon, and
   each is intensively bred today by local and multinational seed
   companies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The plant pollination service provided by pollinators is
   crucial for ecosystem maintenance, especially in highly fragmented
   landscapes, such as urban areas.
   Aims: We assessed at multiple spatial scales the influence of the degree
   of urbanisation on pollinator communities and pollination success.
   Methods: Artificial populations of Lotus corniculatus (Fabaceae) were
   established along an urbanisation gradient in gardens where pollinator
   communities were surveyed. We described the plant and pollinator
   composition of gardens (local scale) and measured landscape structure in
   nested buffers (small and large landscape scales).
   Results: At the local scale, species richness and abundance of
   pollinators increased with the number of spontaneous plants and the size
   of semi-natural areas, while at the large landscape scale pollinators
   were more diverse and abundant in diversified landscapes with extensive
   green space and low cover of impervious surfaces. At the small landscape
   scale, the pollination success was favoured by agricultural areas, and
   disfavoured by housing density and fragmentation. It was also favoured
   by green space cover at the large landscape scale.
   Conclusions: The variables that affect pollination differ across spatial
   scales. Local and landscape variables have different effects according
   to spatial scale, suggesting different underlying causes, such as the
   presence of flower resources or of suitable habitats in the
   surroundings. Our results emphasise the importance of accounting for all
   spatial scales when managing pollination services.}},

Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{1, SI}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Research has shown that exposure to semiochemicals significantly
   improves the mating performance of males from some of the most
   economically important agricultural tephritid fruit fly pests species.
   There is consequently a growing awareness of the need to include a
   pre-release semiochemical treatment in sterile insect technique pest
   control programmes, to ensure optimal sexual performance of sterile male
   flies vis-a-vis wild males and to ensure their survival in the wild.
   This is, however, not a matter of simply spraying flies with the
   semiochemical as several species (including Bactrocera dorsalis and
   Bactrocera carambolae) need to actively ingest and metabolize the
   chemical for it to have the desired effect. Currently, no economical or
   efficient method exists for large-scale administering/feeding of
   semiochemicals to such species. This may be due to the complicated
   requirements of (i) administering the semiochemical only to flies that
   are close to sexual maturity, (ii) assuring fixed-dose feeding to avoid
   damaging over exposure to flies and (iii) segregating semiochemically
   satiated from non-satiated flies prior to release. Using an engineering
   approach, while leveraging biological behaviour patterns (such as
   attraction to the semiochemicals and light), a mass semiochemical
   feeding structure was designed that fulfils all three requirements. The
   aim of the design was furthermore to maximize survival of flies and to
   minimize semiochemical wastage and hence cost. To validate the proposed
   design and to ascertain the behaviour of insects interacting within such
   a structure, a prototype was constructed and tested for B.dorsalis (with
   methyl eugenol as the attractant) and Ceratitis capitata (with citrus
   oil as the attractant). Our results show that the used semiochemicals
   and drivers, especially the novel conveyor belt system, are effective in
   encouraging the flies through the facility with minimum damage and
   without backward motion of flies.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are mobile organisms that seek food and nesting opportunities from
   a range of habitats. It is important to understand the way they move in
   agricultural landscapes if we are to conserve them and benefit from
   their activity as pollinators. We surveyed bees using directional flight
   interception (Malaise) traps over a 1-year period in two agricultural
   landscapes in south-east Queensland, Australia. We placed traps at the
   ecotone between crops and remnant vegetation to establish the pattern of
   movement between these habitats. Species richness in these landscapes
   (70) was high relative to that in comparable studies. Some bees were
   active year round, but most were caught in the period September to
   March. Across the whole assemblage there was a significant pattern where
   more species were detected leaving rather than entering remnant
   vegetation. The same bias was true for the number of individuals of the
   two most abundant species (Homalictus urbanus and Apis mellifera).
   Species exclusively found in crops were smaller on average (and
   therefore have smaller foraging range) than their non-crop counterparts.
   Together, these patterns indicate that while bees are abundant in crop
   habitat, the remnant vegetation is important as the point of origin for
   bee movements, and the riparian remnant in particular is richer than the
   dry native remnant. Compositional similarity among samples was
   significantly explained by landscape but also movement direction (i.e.
   to or from the riparian remnant) because different species showed
   different patterns of response. The landscape with greater native
   vegetation cover supported more species in and around crops than the
   landscape with less native vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Surveying terrestrial invertebrates often requires lethal techniques
   that can also kill non-target vertebrates. Removing the desirable
   components of biodiversity is at odds with the philosophy of ecological
   restoration and biodiversity conservation more generally. Moreover,
   commonly used metrics generated by such survey approaches (e. g.
   abundance and species richness) are only indirectly related to the
   ecosystem services (e. g. pollination) that are often of primary
   interest. We examined the relationship between rates of dung removal (a
   direct measure of an ecosystem service) and dung beetle abundance and
   species richness in a temperate region of New South Wales, Australia,
   and examined if dung removal in revegetated riparian areas of different
   ages were trending monotonically toward rates in areas with mature
   native vegetation. Pellets of pig manure and conventional traps were
   left at study sites for 48 h to examine the relationships between rates
   of dung removal and dung beetle abundance and richness. Regressions of
   abundance and richness with average percent dung removal were positive
   and significant, demonstrating the potential of the method as a
   non-lethal proxy. While the dung removal method cannot determine the
   species responsible, percentage dung removal was more time-efficient,
   costing 4 min per sample, while abundance and richness cost 13 and 17
   min, respectively. Despite variability among replicates of the same
   habitat type, the trajectory across the restoration gradient showed an
   increase from sites recently revegetated toward those with mature woody
   vegetation. We interpreted these results as a positive response of dung
   beetle activity and an indication of recovery of this ecosystem service.
   We argue that responses that can be collected efficiently such as dung
   removal should be used if restorationists have limited resources for
   data collection and analysis; non-specialists are involved; knowledge of
   ecosystem function is required, and animal ethics constrain options. (C)

Abstract = {{The global climate change reported over recent years may prompt changes
   in the atmospheric pollen season (APS). The aim of this study is to
   evaluate the possible impact provoked by meteorological conditions
   variations at different seasons of the year or different geographical
   areas on APS. Alnus, Betula and Castanea atmospheric pollen seasons and
   trends during the last 17 years at Ourense and Vigo (Galicia-NW Spain)
   and Perugia (Italy) were analysed. Possible incidence of the
   meteorological trends observed in the different cities on the
   atmospheric pollen seasons and the chill and heat requirements were
   evaluated. Pollen data from Ourense, Vigo and Perugia (1995-2011) were
   used. Pollen sampling was performed using LANZONI VPPS 2000 volumetric
   traps (Hirst in Ann Appl Biol 36:257-265, 1952), placed on top of
   different buildings at a similar height from the ground. Several
   methods, dates and threshold temperatures for determining the chill and
   heat requirements needed to trigger flowering were tested. Different
   temporary order in the pollination sequence was observed between the
   three pollen types studied in the three sites. Alnus flowers few days in
   advance in Ourense respecting to Vigo and 1 month earlier than Perugia.
   The Betula flowering start date in Ourense and Vigo is almost
   simultaneous, taking place only 5 days in advance with respect to
   Perugia. Finally, scarce differences in the APS onset of Castanea were
   detected between the three cities. The variations observed among the two
   areas (Umbria, Italy and Galicia, Spain) in the onset of pollen season
   in the winter or spring flowering trees could be explained by
   differences in the thermal requirements needed for flowering as
   consequence of the climatic conditions recorded during the previous
   period to flowering. The length of the chilling and heat period as well
   as the thermal requirements obtained showed differences between
   geographical areas. The chill requirements accumulated were higher in
   Perugia than Ourense and Vigo. By contrary, the lowest heat accumulation
   was achieved in Perugia. The observed trends in the APS characteristics
   and the weather-related parameters were not homogeneous both in the
   pollen types and sites. The pollen index of Betula and Castanea pollen
   in Ourense shows a significant trend to increase.}},

Title = {{Plant Pollinator Networks along a Gradient of Urbanisation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Habitat loss is one of the principal causes of the current
   pollinator decline. With agricultural intensification, increasing
   urbanisation is among the main drivers of habitat loss. Consequently
   studies focusing on pollinator community structure along urbanisation
   gradients have increased in recent years. However, few studies have
   investigated how urbanisation affects plant-pollinator interaction
   networks. Here we assessed modifications of plant-pollinator
   interactions along an urbanisation gradient based on the study of their
   morphological relationships.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Along an urbanisation gradient
   comprising four types of landscape contexts (semi-natural, agricultural,
   suburban, urban), we set up experimental plant communities containing
   two plant functional groups differing in their morphological traits
   ({''}open flowers'' and ``tubular flowers''). Insect visitations on
   these communities were recorded to build plant-pollinator networks. A
   total of 17 857 interactions were recorded between experimental plant
   communities and flower-visitors. The number of interactions performed by
   flower-visitors was significantly lower in urban landscape context than
   in semi-natural and agricultural ones. In particular, insects such as
   Syrphidae and solitary bees that mostly visited the open flower
   functional group were significantly impacted by urbanisation, which was
   not the case for bumblebees. Urbanisation also impacted the generalism
   of flower-visitors and we detected higher interaction evenness in urban
   landscape context than in agricultural and suburban ones. Finally, in
   urban context, these modifications lowered the potential reproductive
   success of the open flowers functional group.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our findings show that open flower plant
   species and their specific flower-visitors are especially sensitive to
   increasing urbanisation. These results provide new clues to improve
   conservation measures within urbanised areas in favour of specialist
   flower-visitors. To complete this functional approach, studies using
   networks resolved to the species level along urbanised gradients would
   be required.}},

Abstract = {{Gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) is controlled by a highly
   polymorphic locus called the S-locus, which is an important factor that
   can result in seedless fruit in Citrus. The S1 self-incompatibility
   locus-linked pollen 3.15 gene (S1-3.15) belongs to a type of S locus
   gene. The role of S1-3.15 in the SI reaction of Citrus has not yet been
   reported. In this study, full-length sequences of cDNA and DNA encoding
   the S1-3.15 gene, referred to as CrS1-3.15, were isolated from
   Wuzishatangju' (Self-incompatibility, SI) and Shatangju'
   (Self-compatibility, SC). The predicted amino acid sequences of
   CrS1-3.15 between Wuzishatangju' and Shatangju' differ by only three
   amino acids. Compared to Wuzishatangju', three bases were substituted in
   the genomic DNA of CrS1-3.15 from Shatangju'. Southern blot results
   showed that one copy of CrS1-3.15 existed in the genomic DNA of both
   Wuzishatangju' and Shatangju'. The expression level of the CrS1-3.15
   gene in the ovaries of Shatangju' was approximately 60-fold higher than
   that in the ovaries of Wuzishatangju'. When Wuzishatangju' was
   cross-pollinated, the expression of CrS1-3.15 was upregulated in the
   ovaries at 3 d, and the highest expression levels were detected in the
   ovaries at 6 d after cross-pollination of Wuzishatangju' x Shatangju'.
   To obtain the CrS1-3.15 protein, the full-length cDNA of CrS1-3.15 genes
   from Wuzishatangju' and Shatangju' was successfully expressed in Pichia
   pastoris. Pollen germination frequency of Wuzishatangju' was inhibited
   significantly with increasing CrS1-3.15 protein concentrations from SI
   Wuzishatangju'.}},

   reliance on pollinator-dependent crops have raised concerns about native
   pollinator conservation and dispersal across human-altered landscapes.
   Bumble bees are one of the most effective native pollinators and are
   often the first to be extirpated in human-altered habitats, yet little
   is known about how bumble bees move across fine spatial scales and what
   landscapes promote or limit their gene flow. In this study, we examine
   regional genetic differentiation and fine-scale relatedness patterns of
   the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, to investigate how
   current and historic habitat composition impact gene flow. We conducted
   our study across a landscape mosaic of natural, agricultural and
   urban/suburban habitats, and we show that B. vosnesenskii exhibits low
   but significant levels of differentiation across the study system
   (FST=0.019, Dest=0.049). Most importantly, we reveal significant
   relationships between pairwise FST and resistance models created from
   contemporary land use maps. Specifically, B.vosnesenskii gene flow is
   most limited by commercial, industrial and transportation-related
   impervious cover. Finally, our fine-scale analysis reveals significant
   but declining relatedness between individuals at the 19km spatial scale,
   most likely due to local queen dispersal. Overall, our results indicate
   that B.vosnesenskii exhibits considerable local dispersal and that
   regional gene flow is significantly limited by impervious cover
   associated with urbanization.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to determine if self-pollination is needed to trigger
   facultativeparthenocarpy in self-incompatible Clementine mandarins
   (Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan.). Marisol' and Clemenules' mandarins
   were selected, and self-pollinated and un-pollinated flowers from both
   cultivars were used for comparison. These mandarins are always seedless
   after self-pollination and show high and low ability to develop
   substantial parthenocarpic fruits, respectively. The time-course for
   pollen grain germination, tube growth and ovule abortion was analyzed as
   well as that for carbohydrates, active gibberellins (GA1 and GA4), auxin
   (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) content in the ovary. Clemenules' showed
   higher pollen grain germination, but pollen tube development was
   arrested in the upper style 9days after pollination in both cultivars.
   Self-pollination did not stimulate parthenocarpy, whereas both
   un-pollinated and self-pollinated ovaries set fruit regardless of the
   cultivar. On the other hand, Marisol' un-pollinated flowers showed
   greater parthenocarpic ovary growth than Clemenules' un-pollinated
   flowers, i.e. higher ovule abortion rate (+21\%), higher fruit set
   (+44\%) and higher fruit weight (+50\%). Further, the greater
   parthenocarpic ability of Marisol' paralleled higher levels of GA1 in
   the ovary (+34\% at anthesis). Marisol' ovary also showed higher hexoses
   and starch mobilization, but lower ABA levels (64\% at anthesis).
   Self-pollination did not modify carbohydrates or GA content in the ovary
   compared to un-pollination. Results indicate that parthenocarpy in the
   Clementine mandarin is pollination-independent with its ability to set
   depending on the ovary hormone levels. These findings suggest that
   parthenocarpy in fertile self-incompatible mandarins is constitutively
   regulated.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat loss from urban development threatens native plant populations
   in many regions of the world. In addition to direct plant mortality,
   urban intensification potentially impacts pollinator communities and in
   turn disrupts the pollination mutualisms that are critical to the
   viability of native plant populations. We placed standardized flowering
   plant arrays into woodlands along a gradient of increasing urban land
   use to simultaneously quantify landscape-scale and local-scale effects
   on pollinators and on reproduction of two spring ephemeral wildflowers
   (Claytonia virginica and Polemonium reptans) in woodland fragments in
   the Mid-Atlantic Region of North America. Greater pollinator abundance
   and associated diversity significantly reduced the degree of pollen
   limitation, demonstrating that pollinator populations are critical to
   successful pollination of these plant populations. However,
   landscape-scale habitat loss did not reduce pollinator abundance or
   diversity. Habitat loss at the landscape scale therefore does not appear
   to drive changes in pollination in this woodland system. Rather,
   local-scale habitat characteristics were more important, with
   pollinators being more abundant in brighter woodland patches for one
   plant species, and in larger patches for the other species. Because we
   found abundant pollinators and adequate pollination even in isolated,
   urban woodland fragments, our results are encouraging for the
   conservation of both plants and pollinators in urban landscapes. (C)

Abstract = {{Self-incompatibility (SI) is one of the important factors that can
   result in seedless fruit in Citrus. However, the molecular mechanism of
   SI in Citrus is not yet clear. In this study, two suppression
   subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries (forward, F and reverse, R)
   were constructed to isolate differentially expressed genes in pollen
   from ``Wuzishatangju{''} (SI) and ``Shatangju{''} (self-compatibility,
   SC) mandarins. Four hundred and sixty-eight differentially expressed
   cDNA clones from 2077 positive clones were sequenced and identified.
   Differentially expressed ESTs are possibly involved in the SI reaction
   of ``Wuzishatangju{''} by regulating pollen development, kinase
   activity, ubiquitin pathway, pollen-pistil interaction, and calcium ion
   binding. Twenty five SI candidate genes were obtained, six of which
   displayed specific expression patterns in various organs and stages
   after self-and cross-pollination. The expression level of the F-box gene
   (H304) and S1 (F78) in the pollen of ``Wuzishatangju{''} was 5-fold
   higher than that in ``Shatangju{''} pollen. The F-box gene, S1, UBE2,
   UBE3, RNaseHII, and PCP were obviously up-regulated in pistils at 3 d
   after self-pollination of ``Wuzishatangju{''}, approximately 3-, 2-,
   10-, 5-, 5-, and 2-fold higher, respectively than that at the same stage
   after cross-pollination of ``Wuzishatangju{''} x ``Shatangju{''}
   pistils. The potential involvement of these genes in the pollen SI
   reaction of ``Wuzishatangju{''} is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{pVincetoxicum pycnostelma Kitag. (Apocynaceae) is a perennial herb that
   grows in grassland habitats in East Asia and the western part of Amur.
   Urbanization, land development, abandonment of traditional management of
   grasslands, or any combination of these factors are rapidly reducing
   grassland habitats, and V pycnostelma is now ranked as a ``Near
   Threatened{''} species on the Red List of Japan. Identification and
   characterization,of pollinators of this endangered species are important
   in its conservation. We observed and collected insect visitors to the
   flowers at night and in the morning in the populations of V pycnostelma
   on the banks of the Kidzu River, Kyoto, Japan from June to August in
   2011. Pollinators were characterized as those insects on which flower
   pollinaria were attached. Twenty-seven species (9 families; 3 orders)
   were observed visiting the flowers; individuals of 14 lepidopteran
   species (6 families) had pollinaria attached to their bodies and most
   visited the flowers at night. Adult lepidopterans with a proboscis
   length of 0.9 - 4.5 mm were the primary carriers of pollinaria.
   Examination of stigmatic chambers of randomly selected flowers showed
   that the percentage of flowers in which pollinaria was inserted was much
   higher than the percentage of fruit set observed. Reasons for the
   observed low fruit set may be self-incompatibility or resource
   limitation. These preliminary observations were conducted at only 1 site
   and were restricted to a short period of time; yet, these data could be
   useful for elucidation of effective pollinators of this species and,
   thus, its conservation.}},

Abstract = {{To develop cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers for the

   (SS) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) genes from 19 mango cultivars.
   Through comparison of amino acid sequences in a BLASTX search, cloned SS
   and SPS genes were found to be homologs of Citrus unshiu CitSUS1
   (AB022092) and CitSPS1 (O22060), respectively. Therefore, we designated
   the SS and SPS genes as MiSUS1 and MiSPS1, respectively. There were 11
   genotypes in MiSUS1 and 10 in MiSPS1 sequences. In the MiSUS1 nucleotide
   sequences, 46 SNPs and 5 in/dels were detected. Twenty-six out of the 46
   SNPs mapped on the restriction enzyme recognition sites were
   successfully converted to 25 CAPS markers. In the MiSPS1 nucleotide
   sequences, 99 SNPs and 6 in/dels were detected. Thirty out of 99 SNPs
   and 2 out of 6 in/dels mapped on the recognition sites were also
   converted to 32 CAPS markers. By using two CAPS markers, SS-2798 and
   SPS-5745, we identified 37 true hybrids that had different genotypes to
   `Irwin' from 82 F1 progeny obtained through a cross between `Irwin', the
   maternal parent, and paternal parents by using flies as pollinators. The
   method developed here to identify true hybrids is a simple, rapid and
   highly reliable tool for efficient mango breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Bee fauna and associated flora from a grassland site in Brazil, surveyed
   40 and 20 years ago, were newly surveyed with comparable methodology to
   evaluate changes in the bee fauna of this site, considering that human
   population and urbanization has exponentially increased in the last 40
   years. In general, bee species richness has declined in 22\%, as well as
   their abundance. Some of the previously abundant species are now absent,
   including Bombus bellicosus Smith, 1879, Gaesischia fulgurans (Holmberg,
   1903) and Thectochlora basiatra (Strand, 1910). No particular trend of
   differential decrease among either taxonomic or functional groups was
   observed, except for a minor increase in the proportion of oligolectic
   species and a 50\% reduction in the number of large species. The first
   two surveys were more similar to each other in species richness per bee
   genus, while the two most recent grouped together based on measures of
   anthropogenic impact. Furthermore, the number of plant species visited
   by bees increased, with a pronounced increase in ruderal and exotic
   species. Crop cultivation, competition with honeybees and climate
   changes may all be related to bee decline. Nevertheless, the effects of
   urbanization, in particular intense land occupation and few preserved
   natural areas can be pointed as the main causes of species decline. Due
   to continuing increase in human population, increased erosion in
   diversity is expected. Habitat protection is an additional challenge to
   bee conservation in the region, with no local conservation units set
   aside for grasslands. State and municipal agencies should urgently
   consider the establishment of reserves for the few remaining patches of
   natural grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Plant defense compounds occur in floral nectar, but their ecological
   role is not well understood. We provide evidence that plant compounds
   pharmacologically alter pollinator behavior by enhancing their memory of
   reward. Honeybees rewarded with caffeine, which occurs naturally in
   nectar of Coffea and Citrus species, were three times as likely to
   remember a learned floral scent as were honeybees rewarded with sucrose
   alone. Caffeine potentiated responses of mushroom body neurons involved
   in olfactory learning and memory by acting as an adenosine receptor
   antagonist. Caffeine concentrations in nectar did not exceed the bees'
   bitter taste threshold, implying that pollinators impose selection for
   nectar that is pharmacologically active but not repellent. By using a
   drug to enhance memories of reward, plants secure pollinator fidelity
   and improve reproductive success.}},

Title = {{Effects of habitat fragmentation on plant reproductive success and
   population viability at the landscape and habitat scale}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation can significantly affect plant reproductive
   success and ultimately population viability, but little is known about
   the magnitude, direction or time scale of these impacts on
   plant-pollinator mutualisms. In this study, four species of terrestrial
   orchid with specialist and generalist pollination syndromes were used to
   investigate the effects of fragmentation on capsule set in urban
   bushland remnants. Supplementary pollination showed pollination
   limitation, but not resource limitation, occurs across all species.
   Habitat and landscape scale fragmentation predictor variables were used
   to build parsimonious models that explained capsule set data collected
   over 2 years. We found the sexually deceptive species, Caladenia
   arenicola, to be sensitive to interactions between landscape (perimeter
   to area ratio) and habitat scale (bare ground cover and population size)
   predictor variables. The effect of perimeter to area ratio was heavily
   tempered by the significant negative influence of bare ground cover,
   where values of over 40\% bare ground cover resulted in reproductive
   failure. We found that generalist pollinated species had significant
   interactions at the habitat scale including significant positive
   interactions between capsule set and population size and litter cover.
   Our results suggest the effects of habitat fragmentation at the
   landscape and habitat scale are important drivers of population
   viability. Our results suggest population viability will depend on the
   sensitivity of the pollination syndrome and the pollinator involved.
   This study highlights the need for research into reproductive success
   across multiple spatial scales to improve and inform conservation
   efforts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The forests of north-eastern Croatia, as well as various plants and
   trees in the parks and streets of the Osijek-Baranja County, produce
   large amounts of pollen during the pollen season, which can cause
   allergy symptoms in pollen sensitive individuals. The aim of this study
   was to determine the most frequent types of pollen in this area and
   estimate possible health risks, especially the risk of allergy. In 2009
   and 2010, the staff of the Health Ecology Department of the Osijek
   Public Health Institute monitored tree pollen concentrations in four
   cities from the Osijek - Baranja County (Osijek, Nagice, Dakovo and Beli
   Manastir) using a Burkard volumetric instrument. The results were
   affected by weather conditions. Windy and sunny days facilitated the
   transfer of pollen, whereas during rainy days, the concentration of
   pollen grains decreased. High pollen concentrations of
   Cupressaceae/Taxaceae, Betulaceae, Salicaceae and Aceraceae could be the
   cause for symptoms of pollen allergy.
   In 2009, conifers, birch and poplar pollen were dominant at all
   monitoring stations with 5000 pollen grains (PG), 3188 PG and 3113 PG
   respectively. The highest number of pollen grains was recorded at
   measuring site Osijek. The variations in airborne pollen concentration
   between pollen seasons were recorded at all monitoring stations. The
   most obvious variations were recorded at measuring site Osijek. The
   usual pollination period lasts two to three months, which means that
   most pollen grains remain present from February to early June. However,
   the Cupressaceae / Taxaceae pollination periods last the longest and
   their pollen grains remain present until the end of summer. The risk of
   allergy was determined at four monitored measuring stations and the
   obtained data confirmed that the largest number of days with a high
   health risk was at the Dakovo measuring station for a species of birch.
   The research information aims to help allergologists and individuals
   allergic to plant pollen develop preventive measures and proper
   treatment therapies.}},

Abstract = {{In largely urban Singapore, 69\% of the 45 recorded native fig species
   (Ficus, Moraceae) are either critically endangered (24 species) or
   nationally extinct (7 species). Small populations of dioecious fig
   species are expected to be particularly vulnerable, because of evidence
   that their species-specific pollinators may be less mobile than those of
   monoecious figs. We therefore studied the dispersal of pollinating fig
   wasps (Chalcidoidea: Agaonidae) at an urban site by capturing them with
   sticky traps set at 25 m, 10 m, and 2 m above the ground. All but one of
   the pollinator genera expected for Singapore were captured, as well as
   one genus with no local hosts (Kradibia) and one whose only local host
   is apparently extinct (Dolichoris). Pollinators of monoecious host taxa
   dominated the catch (440 wasps; 90\%) and were mostly caught in the 25 m
   traps. Dioecious pollinators were rare (28 wasps; 6\%), despite the
   abundance and frequent reproduction of their hosts in the vicinity, and
   were mostly caught in the 2 m traps. These patterns are similar to those
   reported from previous studies in rural areas and suggests that wasp
   dispersal in Singapore displays similar trends. This study provides
   baseline data on fig wasp diversity found in Singapore through
   dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We evaluated the profiles of allergic rhino-conjunctivitis
   and asthma patients annually in Antalya, a Mediterranean coastal city in
   Turkey.
   Material/Methods: We evaluated patients' allergic clinical status, and
   recorded the climate and pollens in the city center air, investigating
   any correlation between pollination, climatic conditions and allergic
   disorders. The meteorological conditions and the pollen count/cm(2)
   during every month of the year and the concordance of this with the
   patient's clinical status were evaluated.
   Results: SPT positivity for plantago lanceolata, aspergillus fumigatus
   and d. pteronyssinus was significant in patients younger than 40 years
   old. Pollination levels are consistent from March 2010 to February 2011.
   In Antalya, high levels occur mostly from April to June, thus we
   performed skin prick tests mostly in May/June (similar to 30\%). During
   these months meteorological conditions of the city were windy with low
   humidity, without rain, and lukewarm temperatures, all of which
   contribute to high-risk conditions for seasonal allergies.
   Conclusions: The major allergen between April and June was derived from
   Graminea; between February and March was Cupressus spp; and between
   March and June was Pinus spp. These results suggest that the pollination
   is correlated with allergic conditions and thus SPT might be best
   performed according to the pollen count.}},

Abstract = {{Based on recent research on erosion of ecosystem services, planetary
   boundaries and predicted pace of urbanization, it is now apparent that
   humans need to reconnect to the biosphere and that cities in this
   context, properly managed, could provide great opportunities and arenas
   for social ecological change and transformation towards sustainability
   To take advantage of these opportunities one needs to keep in mind that
   most of the ecosystem services consumed in cities are generated by
   ecosystems located outside of the cities themselves, not seldom half a
   world away. In order to operationalize our knowledge, hypothesis and
   theories on the connections between the work of nature and the welfare
   and survival of humans overtime, we suggest the use of the ecosystem
   service framework in combination with the merging of the concept
   ``ecology in cities{''}, mainly focusing on designing energy efficient
   building, sustainable logistics and providing inhabitants with healthy
   and functioning green urban environments, and the ``ecology of
   dries{''}. The ``ecology of cities{''} framework acknowledges the total
   dependence of cities on the surrounding landscape and the ever-ongoing
   dance between urban and rural, viewing the city as an ecosystem. (C)

Abstract = {{Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (UBE1) catalyzes the first step in the
   ubiquitination reaction, which targets a protein for degradation via a
   proteasome pathway. UBE1 plays an important role in metabolic processes.
   In this study, full-length cDNA and DNA sequences of UBE1 gene,
   designated CrUBE1, were obtained from `Wuzishatangju'
   (self-incompatible, SI) and `Shatangju' (self-compatible, SC) mandarins.
   5 amino acids and 8 bases were different in cDNA and DNA sequences of
   CrUBE1 between `Wuzishatangju' and `Shatangju', respectively. Southern
   blot analysis showed that there existed only one copy of the CrUBE1 gene
   in genome of `Wuzishatangju' and `Shatangju'. The temporal and spatial
   expression characteristics of the CrUBE1 gene were investigated using
   semi-quantitative RT-PCR (SqPCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).
   The expression level of the CrUBE1 gene in anthers of `Shatangju' was
   approximately 10-fold higher than in anthers of `Wuzishatangju'. The
   highest expression level of CrUBE1 was detected in pistils at 7 days
   after self-pollination of `Wuzishatangju', which was approximately
   5-fold higher than at 0 h. To obtain CrUBE1 protein, the full-length
   cDNA of CrUBE1 genes from `Wuzishatangju' and `Shatangju' were
   successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. Pollen germination frequency
   of `Wuzishatangju' was significantly inhibited with increasing of CrUBE1
   protein concentrations from `Wuzishatangju'. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Although many theoretical studies have reported strong effects of
   different flowering times on reproductive isolation, such studies have
   all focused on the different flowering time within a season, and the
   subsequently developed models are difficult to apply to the cases of
   diurnal- and nocturnal-flowering species pairs. The different flowering
   times within a day differ from those within a season because of the
   simultaneous opening and closing of the flowers for each species and the
   carry-over of the pollen from early to later times. In this study, we
   consider pollinator-mediated, diurnal- and nocturnal-flowering plants
   and build a new model to study the effects of the different flowering
   times within a day on reproductive isolation. We assume two loci, each
   with two alleles, which determine the opening and closing times of
   flowers, respectively. We numerically calculate the changes in the
   frequencies of the gametes in a model incorporating the reductions in
   hybrid viability, flowering costs, recombination rate and degree of
   dominance at each locus. We found that the early-opening flowers had a
   much higher fitness than the late-opening flowers and that the
   maintenance of the two species was difficult even if their flowering
   times were not overlapping. Therefore, some other mechanisms, such as
   pollinator preference, may be required to explain the coexistence of
   closely related diurnal and nocturnal flowers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Given widespread declines in pollinator communities and increasing
   global reliance on pollinator-dependent crops, there is an acute need to
   develop a mechanistic understanding of native pollinator population and
   foraging biology. Using a population genetics approach, we determine the
   impact of habitat and floral resource distributions on nesting and
   foraging patterns of a critical native pollinator, Bombus vosnesenskii.
   Our findings demonstrate that native bee foraging is far more plastic
   and extensive than previously believed and does not follow a simple
   optimal foraging strategy. Rather, bumble bees forage further in pursuit
   of species-rich floral patches and in landscapes where patch-to-patch
   variation in floral resources is less, regardless of habitat
   composition. Thus, our results reveal extreme foraging plasticity and
   demonstrate that floral diversity, not density, drives bee foraging
   distance. Furthermore, we find a negative impact of paved habitat and a
   positive impact of natural woodland on bumble bee nesting densities.
   Overall, this study reveals that natural and human-altered landscapes
   can be managed for increased native bee nesting and extended foraging,
   dually enhancing biodiversity and the spatial extent of pollination
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Bringing new ornamental plants onto the market is difficult at present,
   because newcomers face stiff competition from the very large numbers of
   ornamentals already on offer the world over. While a steady crop
   turnover is essential for economic survival in the horticulture
   industry, the commercial success of new ornamental plants about to make
   their debut on the market can never be guaranteed. It follows,
   therefore, that one should avoid sourcing new ornamental plants from
   nature with characteristics which are clearly undesirable, in order to
   reduce the commercial risks associated with introducing new plants to
   the market, as well as to ensure that new ornamentals provide optimal
   safety and enjoyment to consumers. Part of this study was thus devoted
   to examining those key undesirable characteristics occurring naturally
   in wild plants among indigenous South African flora. Certain plants
   exhibit adverse characteristics that make them unsuitable for use in
   human living environments, such as their peculiar survival and
   reproductive strategies, as well as their unwelcome interactions with
   other plants or organisms. Poisonous plants, plants producing allergens,
   thorns, irritating trichomes, exudates and latex are particularly
   undesirable. Many attractive indigenous plants require seasonal burning
   by means of veld fires to stimulate growth and flowering, but
   replicating such occurrences in urban settings is both difficult and
   potentially very dangerous. Plant species which develop exceptionally
   large underground structures with tuberous roots as a means of survival
   are obviously not suited for small living spaces. Plants using
   specialised reproductive strategies, such as monocarpic plants that die
   after flowering only once during their lifetime, may cause
   disappointment to their unsuspecting owners. In addition, people may be
   repulsed by the malodorous aromas which some plants produce in order to
   attract their special pollinators, like flies and bottle flies, on which
   they depend; consumers may also not welcome the unwanted organisms which
   these plants draw into human living spaces. Specialised symbiotic
   associations found, for example, in parasitic plants, cannot be
   simulated in cultivation processes and this fact renders these types of
   plants unsuitable for horticultural production. These aspects, and
   others, will be discussed in further detail.}},

Abstract = {{Telfairia occidentalis Hook. f. is an important multipurpose indigenous
   leafy vegetable in Africa, particularly in Nigeria. The usage of this
   crop is gaining more attention and levels of production are on the
   increase, primarily because its cultivation and processing provide
   household food security, income and employment for producers and
   marketers. However, scarcity of improved seeds of this crop during the
   planting seasons and demand from different parts of the country have
   consistently raised the price of the leaves and fruits. During the dry
   season production of this crop, intensive trade develops in fadama areas
   for sale to urban areas where major food-crop markets develop. In
   Nigeria, apart from its dietary and industrial uses, recent reports
   indicate that Telfairia occidentalis may be used in bioremediation of
   heavy-metal-polluted soils. Despite the importance of Telfairia
   occidentalis as an indigenous leafy vegetable, the distribution of
   available genetic materials and their characteristics are not well
   documented, hence their limitation in breeding programmes. Also, there
   is limited information on nutrition and food safety issues. Incentives
   for enhancing Telfairia occidentalis production are limited by the
   dispersed and small-holder nature of the production. The problem of low
   yield of vegetables and pods per unit area planted, pests and diseases,
   recalcitrant nature of the seeds and poor storage of the pods beyond
   about 5 months after physiological maturity are key areas that were
   researched at the National Horticultural Research Institute, Ibadan in
   Nigeria. The present study was conducted to determine the influence of
   assisted pollination and unassisted pollination in enhancing Telfairia
   occidentalis pod set and development. Eight accessions of Telfairia
   occidentalis were selected and evaluated for pod production under
   assisted pollination and unassisted pollination in 2009. The result
   showed that assisted pollination enhanced the development of number of
   pods set (3.82) against 1.82 (unassisted or open pollinated) per female
   plant after fertilization of the ovules. Telfairia occidentalis is
   dioecious in nature but from the study carried out more male plants
   (50.01\%) than female plants (39.77\%) were observed with 10.22\% of the
   plants not expressing their gender. Also male plants initiate flower
   buds earlier (99.44 days) than female plants (117.84 days) after
   planting. Pod size index varied significantly from one genotype to
   another with a mean of 1.75 and mean seed weight of 12.65 g.}},

Abstract = {{Citrus rootstock breeding and development is hindered by the
   polyembryonic nature of the majority of citrus rootstocks. Seeds of
   polyembryonic cultivars or selections contain numerous embryos which are
   nucellar in origin with the zygotic embryo dying due to lack of
   nutrients and over-crowding within the developing seed. Since nucellar
   seedlings are genetically the same as the female parent, this makes it
   almost impossible to breed with polyembyonic rootstocks unless in vitro
   embryo rescue is carried out. A study was undertaken whereby embryo
   development was followed over time (40 days post pollination to 120 days
   post pollination) for a number of parental crossings to determine if
   zygotic embryos could be isolated and rescued at an early enough
   developmental and identifiable stage, in order to produce hybrid
   plantlets from the in vitro rescued embryos. Although there were
   differences between the various crossing combinations in terms of embryo
   development (developmental stage and number), this visual technique
   alone could not be used to identify the zygotic embryos resulting from
   controlled pollinations with certainty. Although various molecular
   methods including the use of RAPDs, SSRs, etc. have been used to
   identify hybrid seedlings, flow cytometry was investigated as a possible
   technique for the identification of hybrids for its simplicity and
   economy. Three replicates for each sample (one each of each parent and `
   hybrid') were analysed using flow cytometry and the DNA content
   determined using a standard of known DNA content (Tahiti Lime). Data
   were analysed using the Student's t-test. The results of the
   investigation indicated that if the DNA contents of the parental
   crossings are significantly different from each other, flow cytometry
   provides an efficient and cost-effective means of determining hybridity
   of seedlings produced from controlled pollinations of polyembryonic
   citrus rootstock crosses.}},

Abstract = {{Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.) is the major exported fresh fruit of
   Indonesia. Mangosteen productivity in Indonesia was about 30-70 kg/tree,
   lower than Malaysia and India which is about 200-300 kg per tree. The
   low productivity of mangosteen in Indonesia is mainly caused by low
   fruit harvest per tree due to excessive abscission of fruits and
   flowers. The causes of this abscission of flowers and fruit is not
   known. Consequently, there are no recommendations for field methods to
   correct this problem. The research was conducted to study the content
   changes of ABA, IAA, and carbohydrate in relation to abscising flower
   and fruit of mangosteen trees. The research was conducted in Mekarsari
   Fruit Garden, Bogor, using 40 mangosteen trees aged 10 years old. ABA
   and IAA content in abscised fruits and flowers were compared to those of
   attached fruits and flowers. Further, the carbohydrate content (total
   sugar) analyzed from the terminal leaves of shoots with abscised flowers
   and fruits were compared with the terminal leaves of shoots with
   attached flowers and fruits. The abscised flowers and fruits had a high
   ABA content, low IAA, and low supply of photosynthate (low total sugar
   content in the leaf tissue). The ABA content in abscised flowers and
   fruits (22.5 ng/g dry weight for flowers and 31.8 ng/g dry weight for
   fruit) was significantly higher than the ABA content in attached flowers
   and fruits (6.7 ng/g dry weight for flowers and 13.4 ng/g dry weight for
   fruit). The IAA content in abscised flowers and fruit (5.4 ng/g dry
   weight for flowers and 0.83 ng/g dry weight for fruit) was significantly
   lower than the IAA content in attached flowers and fruit (8.80 ng/g dry
   weight for flowers and 6.43 ng/g dry weight for fruit). The carbohydrate
   content (total sugar) in leaves of shoots with abscised flowers and
   fruit (40.3 and 52.3 mg/g dry weight of leaf) was lower than that of
   leaves on shoots with attached flowers and fruit (41.2 and 59.1 mg/g dry
   weight of leaf). Based on these results, application of synthetic IAA
   accompanied by adopting good agriculture practices are recommended to
   prevent mangosteen flowers and fruit abscising.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the three major persimmon producing areas in China, more than
   550,000 mu (about 36,667 hectare) persimmon are cultivated in Henan
   Province. And the production of persimmon is 140,000 t per year, mainly
   in Luoyang, Nanyang, Anyang, Xinxiang, Jiaozuo and Pingdingshan City. We
   investigated the persimmon resources, processed products development and
   some Japanese pollination-constant non-astringent (PCNA) persimmon
   cultivars which have been introduced into Henan Province in recent
   years. The main problems including variants are complex, production
   instability, lack of intensification cultivation, scattered planting,
   imperfect marketing system, not-yet-become industrialization
   development, insufficient persimmon storage and deep processing.
   `Jinshi', `Xin'an-niuxinshi', `Boaibayuehuang' and `Xingyangshuishi' are
   the representative astringent persimmon cltivars in Henan Province.}},

Title = {{Interspecific hybridisation in tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala,
   Myrtaceae): a conservation management issue?}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{The anthropogenic movement of Eucalyptus species beyond their natural
   distributions is increasing the opportunity for interspecific
   hybridisation. The conservation implications arising from hybridisation
   between indigenous and introduced eucalypt species in modified urban
   landscapes is an increasingly important management issue that requires
   an assessment of risk. It has been claimed that much of the tuart
   (Eucalyptus gomphocephala DC., Myrtaceae) seed in Kings Park, a large
   urban bushland remnant in Perth, Western Australia, is of hybrid origin
   with introduced eastern Australian eucalypts, and especially with E.
   cladocalyx. Using molecular markers, we tested this claim and determined
   whether hybridisation in tuart is a conservation management issue in
   Kings Park, as well as the adjacent Bold Park. Eight microsatellite
   markers were used to genotype 220 open-pollinated tuart seedlings from
   19 families. Allele frequency estimates for tuart were generated by
   genotyping 42 mature tuart trees. Forty-four trees of four alternative
   species thought to be capable of hybridising with tuart in these parks,
   including two non-indigenous species, E. cladocalyx and E.
   camaldulensis, and two indigenous species, E. decipiens and E. rudis,
   were also genotyped. Pairwise F-ST between tuart and each alternative
   species for these markers ranged from 0.105 to 0.204. A hybrid-index
   analysis of seedling genotypes showed no significant evidence for
   hybridisation, and no alternative species private alleles (n=35) were
   found in any tuart offspring genotypes. A likelihood analysis showed
   that the maximum likelihood of observing no private alleles of the
   alternative species in the progeny occurred at a hybridisation frequency
   of zero for all four alternative species. We conclude that hybridisation
   between tuart and non-indigenous species is not currently a conservation
   management issue in Kings Park and Bold Park. Rather, the invasion of
   pure non-indigenous species, and in particular E. cladocalyx, as weeds
   into bushland is of greater management concern.}},

Abstract = {{Passion fruit generally has high citric acid content. Less-acidic
   passion fruit is increasingly in demand for fresh consumption. In this
   study, the effect of potassium (K) fertilizer on the fruit quality,
   especially acidity, was examined. Two-year-old passion fruit plants were
   grown in 1/5000-a Wagner pots filled with river sand. Nutrient solutions
   containing 0, 6.3, 12.5 and 25.0 mM K were applied from June 6 to
   September 6. Artificial pollination was conducted from June 17 to July 6
   and the number of fruits per plant was regulated to be less than six.
   After harvest, fruit weight and dimensions, titratable acidity (TA),
   total soluble solid (TSS), juice content percentage, and days after
   pollination to harvest (DAP) were measured. Juice K content and its
   relationships with TA or TSS were determined. Leaf greenness (SPAD
   index) was measured monthly, after which leaves were sampled to
   determine N, K, Ca, Mg and Fe contents. TA was lower at lower K
   application rate. Juice having low K content had low TA. TSS was low at
   zero K rate, although there was no statistical relationship between TSS
   and juice K content. DAP increased at lower K rates. Elongation of DAP
   may be one of the reasons of TA decrease. K application rate had no
   effect on juice content percentage, fruit weight and dimensions. Lower
   leaf K concentration occurred at lower K application rate. With zero K
   rate, leaf K content was 1.4-2.2\% at harvest. Leaf Ca and Mg contents
   were higher at lower K rates. Leaf Fe and N contents and SPAD index were
   not related to K rate. Neither deficient nor excess K symptoms were
   observed. These results indicated that keeping leaf K content at around
   2.0\% might be effective to produce less-acidic passion fruit.}},

Abstract = {{Mutualistic interactions are currently mapped by bipartite networks with
   particular architecture and properties. The mycorrhizae connect the
   trees and permit them to share resources, therefore relaxing the
   competition. Ectomycorrhizal macrofungi associated with woody species
   (Quercus robur, Q. cerris, Q. petraea, Tilia tomentosa, Carpinus
   betulus, Corylus avellana, and Q. pubescens) growing in a temperate,
   broadleaved mixed forest, from a hilly area near the city of
   Cluj-Napoca, central Romania were included in a bipartite mutualistic
   network. Community structure was investigated using several network
   metrics, modularity and nestedness algorithms in conjunction with
   C-score index cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling
   (the Kulczynski similarity was index used as most appropriate metric
   selected by minimal stress criterion). The results indicate that the
   network presents high asymmetry (hosts are outnumbered by mycobionts at
   a great extent), high connectance, low modularity, and high nestedness,
   competition playing a secondary role in community assemblage (non
   significant difference between simulated and observed C-score). The
   nestedness pattern is non-random and is comparable to previously
   published results for other similar interactions containing plants. In
   the proposed network, woody species function exclusively as generalists.
   Modularity analysis is a finer tool were identifying species roles than
   centrality measures, however, the two types of algorithms permit the
   separation of species according to their roles as for example connectors
   (generalist species) and ultraperipheral species (specialists).
   Supergeneralist woody species function as hubs for the diverse
   ectomycorrhizal community while supergeneralist ectomycorrhizal fungi
   glue the hubs into a coherent aggregate.}},

   examined the flowering pattern, abundance of flowering, pollen
   production as well as insect visitation of two cultivars of the
   ornamental shrub Potentilla fruticosa L. ('Maanleys' and `Blink'), grown
   in Lublin; a city in south-eastern Poland. P. fruticosa `Maanleys'
   bloomed from the middle of May to the first decade of September and P.
   fruticosa `Blink' from June until October. The pattern of diurnal
   flowering was similar for both cultivars and showed plasticity in the
   season. Flowers opened most intensively in the morning hours, and 80 -
   90\% of the daily installment of newly opened flowers expanded by 8.00 h
   GMT +2h. A delay in the peak of diurnal flowering was noted between the
   spring/summer and summer/autumn periods. The most intense blooming fell
   in the 2nd month of flowering. The mass of pollen produced per flower
   depended on both the number of anthers and the efficiency of
   archesporial tissues. The pollen output varied from 1.4 to 7.2 mg per 10
   flowers ('Maanleys') and from 2.6 to 4.5 mg per 10 flowers ('Blink').
   The mass of pollen produced per individual shrub was substantially
   related to the abundance of blooming. The average estimated pollen
   productivity in the full flowering phase was low; 1 g ('Maanleys') and
   1.5 g ('Blink') per 10 m(2) of shrub crown. The flowers of Potentilla
   fruticosa attracted numerous insects, mainly solitary bees (33 - 43\%),
   dipterans (31 - 42\%), lepidopterans (4 - 14\%), bumblebees (3 - 15\%),
   and honey bees (3 - 4\%). The Potentilla fruticosa `Maanleys' and
   `Blink' are propagated for specific ornamental arrangements and due to a
   long flowering period may be used in small urban courtyards for both
   decorative value and as a pollen delivering plants.}},

Abstract = {{Woody plant performance in a changing global environment has always been
   at the centre of palaeoenvironmental and long-term climate
   reconstructions carried out by means of pollen analysis. In
   Mediterranean regions, Taxus constitutes the highest percentage in past
   pollen diagrams from cold or cool periods, and therefore it is generally
   considered a good index to infer climate features from past records.
   However, a comparison of these inferences with the true current trends
   in pollen production has not been attemped until now. This study reports
   the decline of airborne pollen of Taxus observed in Emilia Romagna, a
   region of northern Italy, during the period 1990-2007. Phenological
   observations on four male specimens and microscopic examination of fresh
   pollen were made in order to check Taxus flowering time and pollen
   morphology. Airborne pollen was monitored through continuous sampling
   with a Hirst volumetric sampler. In the 18-year long period of
   investigation, Taxus pollen production has decreased, while total woody
   pollen abundance in air has increased. The trend of the Taxus pollen
   season shows a delay at the beginning, a shortening of the pollen
   period, and an advance of the end of the pollen season. This was
   interpreted as a response to climate warming. In particular, Taxus
   follows the behaviour of winter-flowering plants, and therefore earlier
   pollination is favoured at low autumn temperatures, while late
   pollination occurs more often, most likely after warm autumn
   temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Corymbia F1 hybrids have high potential for plantation forestry;
   however, little is known of their reproductive biology and potential for
   genetic pollution of native Corymbia populations.
   This study aims to quantify the influence of reproductive isolating
   barriers on the success of novel reciprocal and advanced generation
   Corymbia hybrids.
   Two maternal taxa, Corymbia citriodora subsp. citriodora and Corymbia
   torelliana, were pollinated using five paternal taxa, C. citriodora
   subsp. citriodora, C. torelliana, one C. torelliana x C. citriodora
   subsp. citriodora hybrid and two C. torelliana x C. citriodora subsp.
   variegata hybrids. Pollen tube, embryo and seed development were
   assessed.
   Reciprocal hybridisation between C. citriodora subsp. citriodora and C.
   torelliana was successful. Advanced generation hybrids were also created
   when C. citriodora subsp. citriodora or C. torelliana females were
   backcrossed with F1 hybrid taxa. Prezygotic reproductive isolation was
   identified via reduced pollen tube numbers in the style and reduced
   numbers of ovules penetrated by pollen tubes. Reproductive isolation was
   weakest within the C. citriodora subsp. citriodora maternal taxon, with
   two hybrid backcrosses producing equivalent capsule and seed yields to
   the intraspecific cross.
   High hybridising potential was identified between all Corymbia species
   and F1 taxa studied. This provides opportunities for advanced generation
   hybrid breeding, allowing desirable traits to be amplified. It also
   indicates risks of gene flow between plantation and native Corymbia
   populations.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Self-incompatibility (SI) is one important factor that can result in
   Citrus seedlessness. However, the molecular mechanism of SI in Citrus is
   not clear yet. To isolate the pistil's SI-related genes, a suppression
   subtractive hybridization library was constructed using mature pistils
   of `Wuzishatangju' mandarin (SI) as the tester and mature pistils of
   `Shatangju' mandarin (self-compatibility, SC) as the driver. 229
   differentially expressed cDNA clones from 967 positive clones were
   sequenced and identified. Differentially expressed ESTs are possibly
   involved in the SI reaction of `Wuzishatangju' through a regulating
   signaling pathway, serine/threonine phosphatase activity, receptor
   kinase, embryonic development, gibberellin stimulus, or transcription.
   11 out of 36 SI candidate genes displayed different expression patterns
   in various tissues and stages after self- and cross-pollination of
   `Wuzishatangju'. The expression of CaBP (WY65), a senescence-protease
   (WY372), an unknown gene (WY283), and a WRKY (WY17) were up-regulated in
   the styles of `Wuzishatangju' while higher expression of WY190 was
   observed in styles of `Shatangju'. Highest expression levels of WY65,
   WY372, an annexin (WY598), the zinc-finger protein (WY376), a C2-protein
   (WY291), and an unknown gene (WY318) were detected in styles at 3 days
   after self-pollination of `Wuzishatangju' while lowest levels were
   observed in styles at 3 days after cross-pollination of `Wuzishatangju'
   x `Shatangju'. The potential involvement of these genes in the SI
   reaction is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological restoration has a growing role in policy aimed at reversing
   the widespread effects of environmental degradation. It includes
   activities to assist the recovery of ecosystem structure and function,
   and the associated provision of goods and services. Rooted in ecological
   theory, ecological restoration requires an integrated approach of
   different disciplines; including soil science, hydrology and
   conservation biology, together with the relevant socioeconomical and
   political frameworks. Ecological restoration interventions also rely on
   applied fields such as agronomy, horticulture and forestry. We clarify
   some of the main approaches and challenges of ecological restoration in
   order to encourage cooperation of professionals with a wide array of
   background and skills needed for successful restoration practices. We
   also discuss the diverse impacts of ecological restoration on ecosystems
   and societies. Restoration of soil quality together with improved
   nutrient cycling, water retention, pollination services and regulation
   of soil erosion can benefit traditional agricultural production through
   improved crop or forage production. It also enhances the provision of
   other important ecosystem services, including clean water, wildlife
   habitat, carbon sequestration and recreation. Payments for such
   ecosystem services are a growing source of income for rural inhabitants.
   Ecological restoration can also create new job opportunities in rural
   areas, e.g. nature-based tourism, game hunting and businesses based on
   native plant materials. Agricultural extension services should support
   these kinds of initiatives by putting ecological restoration to a larger
   degree on their agenda and provide expertise in this field.}},

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted to elucidate the predatory activities of the
   ant Oecophylla smaragdina on the bagworm Pteroma pendula in oil palm
   plantations at Teluk Intan, Perak, Peninsular Malaysia, from November
   2010 to August 2011. The ant was found to be prevalent in taller (> 4m)
   palm stands but absent in shorter ones subject to a comparable regime of
   chemical pesticides or biological control. Among the taller palms the
   number of nests per tree ranged from 0 to 13. The abundance level of P
   pendula was significantly lower in trees occupied by O. smaragdina than
   in unoccupied palms. Similarly, the degree of foliar injury was
   significantly lower in occupied palms. There was a strong positive
   correlation between pest density and degree of foliar injury. The number
   of fruiting bunches, indicative of the palm-oil productivity, was
   significantly higher in occupied palms. The predatory behaviour of O.
   smaragdina towards P pendula was confirmed by observations in a
   distinctive chronological sequence. Field experiments showed that O.
   smaragdina preferred to consume pupae over larvae (of all instars),
   until the extermination of the former. The study confirmed that O.
   smaragdina does not attack or disturb the oil palm pollinator weevil,
   Elaeidobius kamerunicus. The ant species thus shows great promise for
   biological control in oil palm.}},

Abstract = {{Phenological patterns in birds appear to be temperature-dependent in
   part, and global temperatures are undergoing change. Many studies of
   bird phenology are conducted at broad temporal but local spatial scales,
   making it difficult to assess how temperature affects bird migration
   across landscapes. Recently, networks of ``citizen science{''}
   volunteers have emerged whose collective efforts may improve phenology
   studies as biases associated with such efforts are recognized and
   addressed. We compared mean Ruby-throated Hummingbird (Archilochus
   colubris) first arrival dates from Journey North (2001-2010) with data
   from the North American Bird Phenology Program (1880-1969).
   Ruby-throated Hummingbirds arrived earlier in the more recent period
   throughout the eastern United States; these advances, however, varied by
   latitude from 11.4 to 18.2 days, with less pronounced changes above 41
   degrees N. Warmer winter and spring temperatures in North American
   breeding grounds were correlated with earlier arrivals at lower
   latitudes in our recent period. Surprisingly, Ruby-throated Hummingbirds
   arrived later at high latitudes (42-43 degrees N) during warmer winters
   and later at both mid- and high latitudes (38-39, 41-44 degrees N)
   during warmer springs, which perhaps indicates extended migratory
   stopovers below 40 degrees N during these years. Overall, weather
   variables predicted arrival dates better in the recent than in the
   historical period. Our results document spatial variability in how
   warming temperatures affect hummingbird arrivals and add credence to the
   hypothesis that spatial differences in arrival patterns at high versus
   low latitudes could exacerbate asynchrony between some birds and their
   food resources and modify associated ecosystem services such as
   pollination and insect pest suppression. Received 28 March 2012,

Abstract = {{As the pace of urbanization accelerates, the conservation of urban
   biodiversity emerges as a rising concern. Urban ecological research has
   revealed that some green areas in cities can harbor a rich diversity of
   species that can be enhanced by certain landscape- and local-scale
   structural planning variables. However, while most studies have been
   conducted in large greenspaces (e.g., parks, remnants), less effort was
   made to understand which variables influence biodiversity within small
   green patches and the efficiency of management practices has been seldom
   investigated. Here, we explore how management practices interplayed with
   landscape and structural variables to influence the diversity of plants,
   birds, butterflies and other pollinating insects in small public gardens
   (0.5-2.0 ha) in the center of a large metropolis (Paris, France).
   Small public gardens hosted significant common biodiversity and the ones
   that employed a conservation program (i.e., differential management)
   supported a higher diversity of all taxa and less urbanophile
   communities of birds and butterflies. Local-scale and management
   variables were more important in enhancing biodiversity than
   landscape-scale variables. Specifically, lawns rich in wild plants
   attracted many pollinators and bird richness increased with tree cover.
   Pesticides had a negative effect on bird richness, while a higher
   diversity of habitats and soils (i.e. mulching, peat) increased the
   diversity of all four taxa. We also found that bird richness could serve
   as a reasonable surrogate for butterflies and other pollinators. Our
   results highlight how planning and managing public gardens in the center
   of a large metropolis can benefit biodiversity, regardless of spatial
   context. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Pollinator nesting guilds respond differently to urban habitat
   fragmentation in an oak-savannah ecosystem}},

Abstract = {{. 1. Habitat fragmentation is thought to threaten biodiversity, but the
   response of pollinators to fragmentation is still poorly understood, and
   research seldom includes pollinator nesting requirements. 2. We
   investigated pollinator community composition in a highly fragmented
   oak-savannah ecosystem in south-western British Columbia, Canada. We
   sampled pollinators in 19 fragments ranging from 0.3 to 31 ha and
   surrounded by a variety of land-use types, including forest, low-density
   suburban, and urban neighbourhoods. Pan-trapping and netting surveys
   captured 4464 bees, flies, and wasps in 138 species and 48 genera. 3.
   Contrary to expectations, overall species richness did not increase with
   fragment size. However, ground-nester abundance (not diversity) and
   cavity-nester diversity (not abundance) were higher in larger fragments,
   as expected. Floral richness and abundance did not foster pollinator
   diversity for either guild. Brood parasite responses were complex: host
   availability (ground-nesting bees) was generally important, richness and
   abundance increased in fragments with high surrounding road density, and
   abundance also increased in fragments with other habitat fragments
   nearby. 4. Responses of different nesting guilds to fragmentation may be
   related to their use of the landscape surrounding habitat fragments.
   Some common cavity nesters can nest in fences and gardens, but urban
   land use may be less hospitable for ground nesters. Brood parasites
   apparently respond both to host availability and landscape
   characteristics associated with movement among fragments. 5.
   Consideration of nesting requirements of pollinators provided some
   insight into their response to habitat loss in our analysis and should
   be considered in future studies of fragmentation impacts on pollinator
   biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation and loss of vital ecosystem functions and services have
   been an uncontested result of urbanisation. An understanding of how
   ecosystem services are provided along rural-urban gradients is crucial
   in the task of conserving and enhancing vital services in urban
   environments, increasing the quality of life of urban dwellers, and
   working towards a sustainable future. Focusing on nine ecosystem
   services - aesthetic, spiritual, recreation, water flow regulation,
   carbon sequestration, climate change adaptation, pollination,
   biodiversity potential, and noise attenuation - regarded as important to
   urban areas the authors detail the changes in the values of these
   services along a gradient comprising four categories of urbanisation:
   urban, suburban, pen-urban and rural, in Greater Manchester, UK. The
   data on which the discussion is based are derived from an
   interdisciplinary assessment tool, developed from a selection of
   previously used assessment methods including the Residential Environment
   Assessment Tool and the Green Flag Award. Based on a mixture of a field
   and desktop study, the new tool assigns non-economic values of 0-10 to
   the selected services, allowing for evaluation of quality between, as
   well as within, each category of ecosystem service. Trends in the
   results are discussed, as are drivers for the changes in values along
   the rural-urban gradient. It is foreseen that this new body of knowledge
   will allow both practitioners and academics to gain further insight into
   the provision of ecosystem services along a rural-urban gradient to
   allow them to tackle the problems associated with them and to optimise
   open space planning. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Monophyly or Paraphyly - The Taxonomy of Holcoglossum (Aeridinae:
   Orchidaceae)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Recently, there have been a lot of intense debates about the
   acceptance/rejection of paraphyletic groups in biological
   classification. On the one hand, evolutionary classification states that
   similarity and common descent are two criteria for biological
   classification and paraphyletic groups are natural units of biological
   classification. On the other hand, cladistic classification considers
   that common descent is the only criterion in biological classification
   and monophyly should be strictly adhered to. Holcoglossum is used herein
   as a case to illustrate this problem. Although Holcoglossum is a small
   orchid genus of less than 20 species, there is little consensus about
   its generic circumscription since it was established, which leads to
   confusion in taxonomic treatments in the Aerides-Vanda group. Based on
   the analyses of molecular and morphological evidence, our results
   suggest that the clade comprising Holcoglossum s.s., Ascolabium,
   Penkimia and Ascocentrum himalaicum is strongly supported as a
   monophyly, and that the three taxa are nested within different subclades
   of Holcoglossum s.s. Thus, it is reasonable to recognize a monophyletic
   circumscription of Holcoglossum, which is also well supported by some
   vegetative and floral characters. The Holcoglossum s.l. would facilitate
   a better understanding of pollinator-driven floral divergence and
   vegetative stasis than a paraphyletic and narrowly defined genus.

   the use of helpful tools for free publishing and collaborative writing
   that can be adopted or adapted for various uses. One group that has
   consciously tried to take into account all of the processes necessary to

   Living in Dunedin, a small city with strong community networks, I work
   collaboratively with artists, educators and designers, businesses and
   institutions as a supporter of node gateways to new media open methods,
   resources and tools. This practice extends to national and international
   networks, including the non-profit group FLOSS Manuals and its agile
   book creation process.
   I came to work with FLOSS Manuals through my involvement within a tiny,

Abstract = {{Open-pollinated progeny of Corymbia citriodora established in replicated
   field trials were assessed for stem diameter, wood density, and pulp
   yield prior to genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and
   testing the significance of associations between markers and assessment
   traits. Multiple individuals within each family were genotyped and
   phenotyped, which facilitated a comparison of standard association
   testing methods and an alternative method developed to relate markers to
   additive genetic effects. Narrow-sense heritability estimates indicated
   there was significant additive genetic variance within this population
   for assessment traits () and genetic correlations between the three
   traits were negligible to moderate (r (G) = 0.08 to 0.50). The
   significance of association tests (p values) were compared for four
   different analyses based on two different approaches: (1) two software
   packages were used to fit standard univariate mixed models that include
   SNP-fixed effects, (2) bivariate and multivariate mixed models including
   each SNP as an additional selection trait were used. Within either the
   univariate or multivariate approach, correlations between the tests of
   significance approached +1; however, correspondence between the two
   approaches was less strong, although between-approach correlations
   remained significantly positive. Similar SNP markers would be selected
   using multivariate analyses and standard marker-trait association
   methods, where the former facilitates integration into the existing
   genetic analysis systems of applied breeding programs and may be used
   with either single markers or indices of markers created with genomic
   selection processes.}},

Abstract = {{Seedlessness is an important economic trait of lemon. Understanding the
   cellular and molecular mechanisms of seedlessness in `Xiangshui' lemon
   requires detailed data on pollen and embryo sac fertility, embryo
   development and compatibility mechanisms governing self- and
   cross-pollination. The results of the current study indicate that the
   fertility of pollen and mature embryo sac remains normal. When flowers
   were self- or cross-pollinated, pollen grains of `Xiangshui' were able
   to germinate on the stigma. In the case of self-pollination, pollen
   tubes became twisted, tube tips enlarged and tubes ruptured in the
   bottom of stigma. Following cross-pollination, tubes were able to grow
   normally in the style and ovary and enter the embryo sac, where double
   fertilization took place. Embryonic development resulting from
   cross-pollination was normal. After cross-pollination, the zygote began
   to divide at 2 weeks post-pollination, with early globular embryos
   observed after 3 weeks, globular and heart-shaped embryos at 4 weeks,
   torpedo-shaped embryos at 5 weeks, cotyledonary embryos at 6 weeks and
   thereafter germinable seeds. After self-pollination, however, ovules
   began to abort at 2 weeks post-pollination, with ovules disappearing at
   5 weeks, ultimately producing seedless fruits. Emasculated unpollinated
   flowers also developed into seedless fruits, indicating that
   seedlessness contributes to parthenocarpy. However, gametophytic
   self-incompatibility has a major role in seedlessness in `Xiangshui'
   lemon by blocking fertilization at the bottom of the stigma.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies on the obligate interaction between fig trees and their
   pollinating agaonid wasps have focused on population aspects and
   wasp-seed exploitation at the level of the inflorescence. Detailed
   studies on larval and gall development are required to more fully
   understand how resources are exploited and adaptations fine-tuned by
   each partner in nursery pollination mutualisms. We studied the larval
   development of the active pollinating fig wasp, Pegoscapus sp., and the
   galling process of individual flowers within the figs of its monoecious
   host, Ficus citrifolia, in Brazil. The pollinator development is
   strongly dependent on flower pollination. Figs entered by pollen-free
   wasps were in general more likely to abort. Retained, unpollinated figs
   had both higher larval mortality and a lower number of wasps. Pegoscapus
   sp. larvae are adapted to plant development, with two contrasting larval
   feeding strategies proceeding alongside gall development. The first two
   larval stages behave as ovary parasites. Later larval stages feed on
   hypertrophied endosperm. This indicates that a successful galling
   process relies on endosperm, and also reveals why pollination would be a
   prerequisite for the production of high-quality galls for this
   Pegoscapus species.}},

Title = {{Cross-pollination of research findings, although uncommon, may
   accelerate discovery of human disease genes}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL GENETICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Technological leaps in genome sequencing have resulted in a
   surge in discovery of human disease genes. These discoveries have led to
   increased clarity on the molecular pathology of disease and have also
   demonstrated considerable overlap in the genetic roots of human
   diseases. In light of this large genetic overlap, we tested whether
   cross-disease research approaches lead to faster, more impactful
   discoveries.
   Methods: We leveraged several gene-disease association databases to
   calculate a Mutual Citation Score (MCS) for 10,853 pairs of genetically
   related diseases to measure the frequency of cross-citation between
   research fields. To assess the importance of cooperative research, we
   computed an Individual Disease Cooperation Score (ICS) and the average
   publication rate for each disease.
   Results: For all disease pairs with one gene in common, we found that
   the degree of genetic overlap was a poor predictor of cooperation
   (r(2)=0.3198) and that the vast majority of disease pairs (89.56\%)
   never cited previous discoveries of the same gene in a different
   disease, irrespective of the level of genetic similarity between the
   diseases. A fraction (0.25\%) of the pairs demonstrated cross-citation
   in greater than 5\% of their published genetic discoveries and 0.037\%
   cross-referenced discoveries more than 10\% of the time. We found strong
   positive correlations between ICS and publication rate (r(2)=0.7931),
   and an even stronger correlation between the publication rate and the
   number of cross-referenced diseases (r(2)=0.8585). These results
   suggested that cross-disease research may have the potential to yield
   novel discoveries at a faster pace than singular disease research.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the frequency of cross-disease
   study is low despite the high level of genetic similarity among many
   human diseases, and that collaborative methods may accelerate and
   increase the impact of new genetic discoveries. Until we have a better
   understanding of the taxonomy of human diseases, cross-disease research
   approaches should become the rule rather than the exception.}},

Abstract = {{Gene flow between hybridizing plant species depends strongly on
   pollinator behaviour, which affects pollen transfer among floral types
   and reproductive isolation. We examined bumblebee behaviour and pollen
   transfer between two hybridizing Rhinanthus species that are very
   similar in ecology and floral traits. The two species, Rhinanthus minor
   and R. angustifolius, shared similar pollinator guilds and assemblages,
   but pollinator recruitment and flower visitation rates were higher in R.
   angustifolius sites, probably because of its higher reward levels and
   better visibility. When presented with Rhinanthus flowers, bumblebees
   that previously foraged on R. angustifolius were less prone to visit R.
   minor inflorescences, while R. minor foragers accepted both species in
   similar proportions. Although Rhinanthus has been cited as a case of
   mechanical isolation resulting from interactions between bee behaviour
   and differences in stigma and anther placement, we found no support for
   efficient mechanical reproductive isolation. Bumblebees that foraged on
   R. minor flowers carried more pollen, but pollen placement on their
   bodies was similar to that of bees that visited R. angustifolius, and
   cross-specific stigmatic pollen deposition was similar in both
   directions. However, the asymmetry in pollinator handling time between
   the two species, due to dissimilar pollen rewards, may have lowered
   relative heterospecific pollen receipt on R. angustifolius, suggesting
   that net gene flow resulting from pollen transfer dynamics is more
   likely towards R. minor, although this effect remains weak and will be
   most likely counterbalanced by context-based labile pollinator
   preference.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination process and breeding system of the sympatric Habenaria
   johannensis, H.?macronectar, H.?megapotamensis and H.?montevidensis was

   species investigated offer a nectar reward (mean values of total sugars
   ranging from 18 to 26\%) concealed in a spur. Habenaria montevidensis is
   pollinated by butterflies (Hesperiidae, especially of the genus Urbanus)
   that carry pollinaria on their eyes; the other three species are
   pollinated by Sphingidae. Habenaria johannensis is pollinated by the
   moths Manduca rustica and M.?sexta that carry the pollinaria at the base
   of the proboscis. Habenaria macronectar is pollinated by the moths
   Eumorpha labrusca and M. cf. lucetius, and these bear pollinaria between
   the palpi. Habenaria megapotamensis is pollinated by moths of M. cf.
   lucetius that bear the pollinaria on the proboscis. All species studied
   are self-compatible, but pollinator dependent. They also displayed high
   reproductive success (ranging from 69.48 to 97.40\%) and male efficiency
   factors slightly higher than 1, suggesting that at least one flower was
   pollinated for each flower acting as pollen donor. At the study sites,
   the investigated Habenaria spp. are isolated (in terms of pollination)
   by a set of factors that includes differing floral morphologies,
   different pollinators and/or different pollinarium placement on the

Abstract = {{Two complex populations derived from the salt-tolerant citrus rootstock
   Cleopatra mandarin were used to investigate (1) the genomic regions
   affected by segregation distortion and (2) gene segregation
   heterogeneity and their causes and to obtain (3) a Citrus reshni linkage
   map to genetically analyze (4) the duration of the juvenility period and
   the seed embryony type. Both populations differed in the extent and
   origin of segregation distortion. The population derived from the cross
   between C. reshni and Poncirus trifoliata (R x Pr) showed 75 \% of
   codominant markers with distorted segregation. The origin of this
   distortion was prezygotic in most cases. Meanwhile, 100 \% of codominant
   markers in the self-pollinated population {[}F-2(R x Pr)] showed
   genotypic distortion, and the origin of such distortion was mostly
   postzygotic, with the heterozygote being the most frequent genotype in
   all cases. In the R x Pr population, where two pollinator varieties were
   used, allele segregation was significantly heterogeneous not only in P.
   trifoliata (28.6 \% of markers) but also in C. reshni (19.5 \%). The
   results on segregation heterogeneity in the F-2(R x Pr) suggest the
   presence at linkage group 4c of a postfertilization system of balanced
   lethal factors that reduces homozygosis in self-compatible hybrids. Four
   low to medium contributing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected
   for the duration of juvenility period by both Kruskal-Wallis and
   interval mapping methodologies. For seed embryony type, three QTLs were
   detected by both methodologies, with the previously reported Apo2 being
   the QTL contributing the most. CR14,290 and TAA15 are good markers for
   early selection of polyembryonic rootstocks in progenies derived from C.
   reshni, Citrus aurantium, and Citrus volkameriana.}},

Abstract = {{Wild pollinators provide important services to both wild and
   human-dominated ecosystems, yet this group may be threatened by
   widespread anthropogenic landscape change. Suburban sprawl is one of the
   fastest growing types of land use change in North America, and it has
   certain characteristics, such as abundant floral resources, that may be
   beneficial for many pollinators. We examined the effects of sprawl on
   the wild bee assemblage of the shortgrass steppe on the Front Range of
   Colorado, USA. Diversity, abundance, and community composition of bees
   in remnant grassland fragments surrounded by suburban residential land
   use were compared with those in extensive, continuous grassland. No
   overall effect of suburbanization on bee abundance was observed, and
   abundance was extremely variable even within study sites. Bee species
   richness was positively but nonlinearly related to grassland habitat
   area. Bee species density was higher and more variable in suburban
   sites. Suburban sites and smaller habitat area were both related to
   relative increases in the proportions of small bee species, social bees,
   and solitary cavity-nesting bees in the assemblage; small suburban
   habitat areas also favored species of the family Halictidae over Apidae,
   and individuals of the genus Halictus over those of the genus
   Lasioglossum. In this landscape, large native habitat areas surrounded
   by suburban sprawl may actually increase species richness and species
   density over that of continuous grassland, probably by means of habitat
   complementation or supplementation between grassland remnants and the
   surrounding suburban matrix. However, at habitat areas < 20 ha, species
   richness became quite variable; sites < 8 ha contained less than half
   the species of controls.}},

Abstract = {{Fruit-set and growth in tomato depend on the action of gibberellins
   (GAs). To evaluate the role of the GA biosynthetic enzyme GA 20-oxidase
   (GA20ox) in that process, the citrus gene CcGA20ox1 was overexpressed in
   tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cv Micro-Tom. The transformed plants
   were taller, had non-serrated leaves, and some flowers displayed a
   protruding stigma due to a longer style, thus preventing
   self-pollination, similar to GA(3)-treated plants. Flowering was delayed
   compared with wild-type (WT) plants. Both yield and number of fruits per
   plant, some of them seedless, were higher in the transgenic plants. The
   Brix index value of fruit juice was also higher due to elevated citric
   acid content, but not glucose or fructose content. When emasculated,
   1430\% of ovaries from transgenic flowers developed parthenocarpically,
   whereas no parthenocarpy was found in emasculated WT flowers. The
   presence of early-13-hydroxylation and non-13-hydroxylation GA pathways
   was demonstrated in the shoot and fruit of Micro-Tom, as well as in two
   tall tomato cultivars (Ailsa Craig and UC-82). The transgenic plants had
   altered GA profiles containing higher concentrations of GA(4), from the
   non-13-hydroxylation pathway, which is generally a minor active GA in
   tomato. The effect of GA(4) application in enhancing stem growth and
   parthenocarpic fruit development was proportional to dose, with the same
   activity as GA(1). The results support the contention that GA20ox
   overexpression diverts GA metabolism from the early-13-hydroxylation
   pathway to the non-13-hydroxylation pathway. This led to enhanced GA(4)
   synthesis and higher yield, although the increase in GA(4) content in
   the ovary was not sufficient to induce full parthenocarpy.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing urbanization and creation of novel habitat types, green
   roofs can provide habitable space for many species. To date, most
   research on green roofs has focused on minimizing environmental impacts
   of buildings and little is known about the ecological services they may
   provide. Previous research has found a deficiency of pollinating bees on
   green roofs, which could result in pollen limitation, poor seed
   production and reproductive failure of many plant species requiring bee
   pollination. This study aims to determine whether pollination services
   on modern green roofs are sufficient for these novel habitats to
   function sustainably. Nine native Illinois prairie plant species and
   their pollinator communities were studied on green roofs and
   ground-level locations in the Chicago area. Pan traps were used to
   assess pollinator communities and supplemental pollination treatments
   were used to evaluate pollen limitation. All species showed
   significantly reduced seed set when pollinators were excluded but few
   significant differences were observed between supplemental and open
   pollination treatments. Seed set differed by habitat type in that green
   roofs had a higher overall mean percent maximum seed set compared to
   ground-level sites. Our results support previous studies, showing lower
   numbers and diversity of bees on green roofs compared to the ground
   level. Together, these data suggest that although green roofs contain a
   smaller and less diverse community of pollinators, the insects that are
   present provide sufficient pollinator services for many native plants.
   This study therefore supports the use of biotically pollinated native
   forbs in future green roof design. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{The Whereabouts of Flower Visitors: Contrasting Land-Use Preferences
   Revealed by a Country-Wide Survey Based on Citizen Science}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the past decade, accumulating evidence of pollinator
   decline has raised concerns regarding the functioning of terrestrial
   ecosystems and the sustainability of crop production. Although land-use
   changes have been advanced as the major causes, the affinities of most
   wild pollinators with the main land-use types remain unknown. Filling
   this gap in our knowledge is a prerequisite to improving conservation
   and management programmes.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We estimated the affinity of flower
   visitors with urban, agricultural and natural land-uses using data from
   a country-wide scale monitoring scheme based on citizen science
   (Spipoll). We tested whether the affinities differed among insect orders
   and according to insect frequency (frequent or infrequent). Our results
   indicate that the affinities with the three land-use types differed
   among insect orders. Apart from Hymenopterans, which appeared tolerant
   to the different land-uses, all flower visitors presented a negative
   affinity with urban areas and a positive affinity with agricultural and
   natural areas. Additionally, infrequent taxa displayed a lower affinity
   with urban areas and a higher affinity with natural areas than did
   frequent taxa. Within frequent taxa, Hymenoptera and Coleoptera included
   specialists of the three land-use types whereas Diptera and Lepidoptera
   contained specialists of all but urban areas.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our approach allowed the first standardised
   evaluation of the affinity of flower visitors with the main land-use
   types across a broad taxonomical range and a wide geographic scope. Our
   results suggest that the most detrimental land-use change for flower
   visitor communities is urbanisation. Moreover, our findings highlight
   the fact that agricultural areas have the potential to host highly
   diverse pollinator communities. We suggest that policy makers should,
   therefore, focus on the implementation of pollinator-friendly practices
   in agricultural lands. This may be a win-win strategy, as both
   biodiversity and crop production may benefit from healthier communities
   of flower visitors in these areas.}},

Abstract = {{Stigma characteristics and morphology can be useful in taxonomic and
   phylogenetic studies, indicate relationships in stigma function and
   receptivity, and be valuable in evaluating pollen stigma interactions.
   Problematic is that in some taxa, copious stigmatic exudate can obscure
   the fine structural details of the stigmatic surface. Such is the case
   for Citrus, which has a wet stigma type on which abundant exudate
   inundates surface papillae. The components of stigmatic surface
   compounds are highly heterogeneous and include carbohydrates, proteins,
   lipids, glycoproteins, and phenolic compounds. This study evaluated the
   efficacy of several pre-fixation wash treatments on removing surface
   exudate to visualize the underlying stigmatic surface. Wash treatments
   included various buffer solutions, surfactants, dilute acids/bases, and
   solvents. Stigmas prepared using conventional fixation methods in
   glutaraldehyde had considerable accumulations of reticulate surface
   deposits with stigmatic cells obscured. Pre-fixation washes containing
   solvents such as methanol, chloroform, and ethanol left accumulations of
   incompletely removed exudate and crystalline deposits. Alkaline water
   washes produced a crust-like deposit on stigma surfaces. Buffer washes
   left residues of plaque-like deposits with perforated areas. In
   contrast, excellent removal of stigmatic exudate was obtained with a
   pre-fixation wash composed of 0.2 M Tris buffer, pH 7.2, containing
   0.2\% Triton X-100 surfactant and allowed clear imaging of the stigma
   and surface papillae morphology. A central sinus and radially arranged
   openings on the stigmatic surface were clearly visible and shown for the
   first time using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).}},

Abstract = {{The genus Aristolochia presents conserved features in its basic
   structural plan of trap flowers and in its pollination syndrome.
   Visitors, usually flies, are attracted to the rotting-meat scented
   flowers and remain trapped until the second day, when the protogynous
   flowers release them. Aristolochia gigantea Mart. and Zucc showed many
   of these floral traits but display a citronella-like odour, giving the
   opportunity to study the reproductive ecology in this atypical species.
   Characteristics and behavior of pollinators, coupled with the distances
   between individual plants and populations, are important factors in
   patterns of genetic diversity. Thus, our objectives were to study the
   flower visitors, reproductive success, and gene flow in A. gigantea in
   the Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil. Results suggest that pollination
   by flies remains as a conserved interaction within the genus
   Aristolochia. The main pollinators appeared to be Megaselia spp.
   (Phoridae), evidenced primarily by the frequency of their occurrence
   within flowers and the transference of compatible pollen. On the other
   hand, the moderate to low levels of intrapopulation genetic variability
   found in A. gigantea, combined with low effective pollination and its
   reproductive dependence on biotic vectors, indicate that this species
   may be suffering gene erosion in the remaining populations located at
   Chapada Diamantina.}},

Abstract = {{The citrus fresh market demands the production of seedless citrus
   fruits, as seedy fruits are not accepted by consumers. The recovery of
   triploid plants has proven to be the most promising approach to achieve
   this goal, since triploids have very low fertility, are generally
   seedless and do not induce seeds in other cultivars by cross
   pollination. Triploid plants can be recovered by 2x x 4x sexual
   hybridization. In this work, we present an effective methodology to
   recover triploid plants from 2x x 4x hybridizations based on in vitro
   embryo rescue, ploidy level analysis by flow cytometry and genetic
   origin of triploid plants. The pollen viability of diploid and
   tetraploid citrus genotypes was analyzed by comparing the pollen
   germination rate in vitro. The pollen viability of tetraploid
   (doubled-diploid) genotypes is generally reduced but sufficient for
   successful pollination. Triploid embryos were identified in normal and
   undeveloped seeds that did not germinate under greenhouse conditions.
   The influence of parents and environmental conditions on obtaining
   triploid plants was analyzed and a strong interaction was noted between
   the parents and environmental conditions. The parental effect on the
   length of the juvenile phase was also demonstrated through observations
   of a large number of progeny over the last 15 years. The juvenile phase
   length of the triploid hybrids obtained with `Fortune' mandarin as
   female parent and tetraploid `Orlando' tangelo as male parent was
   shorter than the juvenile phase obtained with a clementine as female
   parent and tetraploids of `Nova', `W. Leaf' and `Pineapple' male
   parents.

   2x x 4x sexual hybridizations and the parental effect on the length of

Title = {{Study of the phenology and floral biology of Sesamum radiatum Schumach.

Abstract = {{Traditional leafy vegetables (LFT) are plants whose leaves are used and
   consumed by local human populations. Africa is an enormous reservoir of
   diversity for those vegetables which participate to food security,
   nutrition and monetary income in both rural and urban areas. The leafy
   vegetables are rich in fibres, vitamins and minerals. But intensive and
   repeated harvesting of the LFT in Africa results in their increasing
   rarity. Among endogenous leafy vegetables recorded in Benin, Sesamum
   radiatum Schumach. \& Thonn. (Pedaliaceae) is a species commonly
   consumed by many ethnic groups. During plant development, quantitative
   and qualitative modifications occur, such as an increase in stem size
   and the production of leaves, flowers, fruit and grains To contribute to
   a better understanding of the breeding system and phenology for in situ
   and ex situ conservation of S. radiatum, we conducted both on-station
   and on-farm experiments. The on-station experiment was conducted at the
   International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Abomey-Calavi in
   South Benin (6 degrees 25'N;2 degrees 19' E) to study the phenology, the
   floral biology, the reproductive system and the insects visiting the
   flowers of the species. The on-farm experiment was carried out in Save,
   in central Benin (8 degrees 02'N; 2 degrees 16'E) to study exclusively
   the floral biology and the insects visiting the flowers of the plant in
   its natural biotope. We studied plant phenology, anthesis, floral
   morphology and structure, pollen viability, the reproductive system and
   the insects visiting flowers. Data was analysed by using simple
   descriptive statistics (percentages, means, etc.) to characterise the
   species specific traits that are available in summary tables. In order
   to determine the reproductive system of the species, four pollination
   tests, (lot 1 = natural pollination (control); lot 2 = natural
   autopollination with flowers of the same plant; lot 3 = manual
   autopollination on castrated flowers with pollen from the same plant;
   lot 4 = natural allopollination on castrated flowers within pollen from
   other plants), were carried out. The pollination rate data was
   linearised and analysed with an ANOVA. Student-Newman-Keuls tests were
   used to test for significant differences between pollination treatments.
   Results indicated that S. radiatum is a facultatively allogamous
   hermaphrodite plant with a pollen/ovule ratio equal to 66.1. Regarding
   the phenology of this species, plant development occurs in 75 days with
   four development phases. The first phase lasts for seven days with plant
   height of 22.2 +/- 4.6 mm, the second phase takes 32 days (39 days after
   plant rising) and the plant height is 226.0 +/- 8.9 mm, the following
   phase extends on six days with a plant height of 675.0 +/- 33.8 mm. The
   fourth phase stretches out to 28 days and the plant height reaches 810.0
   +/- 21.0 mm. Blooming period ranges from 4h00 to 6h00 with flowering
   peak at 6h00. Flowering was initiated 56 days after seedling emergence
   and most of the flowers (98\%) appeared 71 days after seedling
   emergence. Insects encountered on open flowers were mostly
   hymenopterans, Lasioglossum duponti (Vachal), Apis mellifera L.,
   Amegilla sp., Amegilla acraensis Fabricius and Xylocopa sp followed by
   dipterans, Paragus borbonicus Macquart, Eurycarenus sp. Some insects
   like Apis mellifera visited the flowers early in the morning (6h00 and
   9h00) whereas others such as Xylocopa sp visited the flowers all day
   long. High synchrony in flowering times among plants suggests that the
   rate of allogamy in S. radiatum may be high.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of airborne pollen concentrations and the weather conditions
   influencing them is important for air quality forecasters, allergists
   and allergy sufferers. For this reason, a 7-day recording volumetric
   spore trap of the Hirst design was used for pollen monitoring between
   January 2006 and December 2007 in Kastamonu, Turkey. A total of 293,427
   pollen grains belonging to 51 taxa were recorded during the study
   period. In the 2 years of study, the period March-August was identified
   as the main pollination season for Kastamonu. The highest monthly pollen
   counts were observed in May in both years. Six taxa made up 86.5\% of
   the total amount of pollen recorded in the atmosphere of Kastamonu.
   These were as follows: Pinaceae (42.9\%), Cupressaceae (20.6\%), Poaceae
   (9.7\%), Quercus (5.5\%) Betula (5.3\%) and Carpinus (2.6\%). Four of
   these are considered to be highly allergenic (Betula, Carpinus,
   Cupressaceae and Poaceae). There were also a greater percentage of
   highly allergenic taxa found within the city, including Betula pendula
   that is not part of the local flora. This shows that through urban
   planting, the public and municipalities can unconsciously create a high
   risk for allergy sufferers. Daily average pollen counts from the six
   most frequently recorded pollen types were entered into Spearman's
   correlation analysis with meteorological data. Mean daily temperature,
   relative humidity, daily rainfall and wind speed were found to
   significantly (p < 0.05) affect atmospheric pollen concentrations, but
   the relationships between pollen concentrations and meteorological
   variables can vary and so there is a need for more local studies of this
   nature.}},

Abstract = {{Local populations are subject to recurrent extinctions, and small
   populations are particularly prone to extinction. Both demographic
   (stochasticity and the Allee effect) and genetic factors (drift load and
   inbreeding depression) potentially affect extinction. In fragmented
   populations, regular dispersal may boost population sizes (demographic
   rescue effect) or/and reduce the local inbreeding level and genetic
   drift (genetic rescue effect), which can affect extinction risks. We
   studied extinction processes in highly fragmented populations of the
   common species Crepis sancta (Asteraceae) in urban habitats exhibiting a
   rapid turnover of patches. A four-year demographic monitoring survey and
   microsatellite genotyping of individuals allowed us to study the
   determinants of extinction. We documented a low genetic structure and an
   absence of inbreeding (estimated by multilocus heterozygosity), which
   suggest that genetic factors were not a major cause of patch extinction.
   On the contrary, local population size was the main factor in
   extinction, whereas connectivity was shown to decrease patch extinction,
   which we interpreted as a demographic rescue effect that was likely due
   to better pollination services for reproduction. This coupling of
   demographic and genetic tools highlighted the importance of dispersal in
   local patch extinctions of small fragmented populations connected by
   gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Two taxonomically undescribed Colocasiomyia species were discovered from
   inflorescences of Alocasia macrorrhizos in Kota Kinabalu City, Sabah,
   Borneo, Malaysia. The aims of this study were to investigate the
   reproductive ecology of the flies and the plant, ascertain the
   importance of the flies as pollinators and examine the intimate
   association between flowering events and life history of the flies. We
   conducted sampling, observations and field pollination experiments. The
   flies were attracted by the odour of female-phase inflorescences in the
   early morning on the first day of anthesis. They fed, mated and
   oviposited in the inflorescences for 1 day. On the second day, the
   flies, covered with pollen grains, left the male-phase inflorescences
   for the next female-phase inflorescences. The immature forms of both fly
   species hatched, developed and pupated within the infructescences
   without damaging the fruits, and developed adults emerged when the
   mature infructescences dehisced. The flowering events and fly behaviours
   were well synchronized. In field pollination experiments, inflorescences
   bagged with a fine mesh (insect exclusion) produced almost no fruits,
   whereas those bagged with a coarse mesh (bee exclusion) produced as many
   fruits as the open-pollinated controls. These results indicate that
   these flies are the most efficient and specialised pollinators for their
   host, A. macrorrhizos. These flies, in return, depend on A. macrorrhizos
   for food and habitat through most of their life cycle. This study
   provides a deeper insight into the less recognised, highly intimate
   pollination mutualism between Araceae plants and Colocasiomyia flies.}},

Abstract = {{The daylily (Hemerocallis fulva) and nightlily (H. citrina) are typical
   examples of a butterfly-pollination system and a hawkmoth-pollination
   system, respectively. H. fulva has diurnal, reddish or orange-colored
   flowers and is mainly pollinated by diurnal swallowtail butterflies. H.
   citrina has nocturnal, yellowish flowers with a sweet fragrance and is
   pollinated by nocturnal hawkmoths. We evaluated the relative roles of
   flower color and scent on the evolutionary shift from a diurnally
   flowering ancestor to H. citrina. We conducted a series of experiments
   that mimic situations in which mutants differing in either flower color,
   floral scent or both appeared in a diurnally flowering population. An
   experimental array of 666 potted plants, mixed with 24 plants of H.
   fulva and 12 plants of either F1 or F2 hybrids, were placed in the
   field, and visitations of swallowtail butterflies and nocturnal
   hawkmoths were recorded with camcorders. Swallowtail butterflies
   preferentially visited reddish or orange-colored flowers and hawkmoths
   preferentially visited yellowish flowers. Neither swallowtail
   butterflies nor nocturnal hawkmoths showed significant preferences for
   overall scent emission. Our results suggest that mutations in flower
   color would be more relevant to the adaptive shift from a diurnally
   flowering ancestor to H. citrina than that in floral scent.}},

Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1215-1226}},

Abstract = {{Corymbia species from different sections hybridize readily, with some of
   increasing economic importance to plantation forestry. This study
   explores the locations of reproductive barriers between interspecific
   Corymbia hybrids and investigates the reproductive success of a wide
   taxonomic range of C. torelliana hybrid crosses.
   Pollen, pistil and embryo development were investigated for four C.
   torelliana crosses (C. torelliana, C. citriodora subsp. citriodora, C.
   tessellaris and C. intermedia) using fluorescent and standard microscopy
   to identify the locations of interspecific reproductive isolating
   barriers. Corymbia torelliana was also crossed with 16 taxa,
   representing six of the seven Corymbia sections, both Corymbia subgenera
   and one species each from the related genera, Angophora and Eucalyptus.
   All crosses were assessed for capsule and seed yields.
   Interspecific C. torelliana hybridization was controlled by pre-zygotic
   reproductive isolating barriers inhibiting pollen adhesion to the
   stigma, pollen germination, pollen tube growth in the style and pollen
   tube penetration of the micropyle. Corymbia torelliana (subgenus
   Blakella, sect. Torellianae) was successfully hybridized with Corymbia
   species from subgenus Blakella, particularly C. citriodora subsp.
   citriodora, C. citriodora subsp. variegata, C. henryi (sect. Maculatae)
   and C. tessellaris (sect. Abbreviatae), and subgenus Corymbia,
   particularly C. clarksoniana and C. erythrophloia (sect.
   Septentrionales). Attempted intergeneric hybrids between C. torelliana
   and either Angophora floribunda or Eucalyptus pellita were unsuccessful.
   Corymbia hybrids were formed between species from different sections and
   subgenera, but not with species from the related genera Angophora or
   Eucalyptus. Reproductive isolation between the interspecific Corymbia
   hybrid crosses was controlled by early- and late-acting pre-zygotic
   isolating barriers, with reproductive success generally decreasing with
   increasing taxonomic distance between parent species. These findings
   support the monophyly of Corymbia and the close relationships of
   infrageneric clades. The hybridizing propensity of Corymbia species
   provides opportunities for breeding but suggests risks of environmental
   gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{The variability of bee communities along an urban gradient has a
   potentially strong impact on pollinator-plant interactions. We
   investigated changes in bee species richness and community composition
   in the city centre and suburbs of PoznaA{''}, Poland. During 2006-2008
   we recorded 2,495 individuals from 104 species. The most abundant
   species was . Other abundant species were , , , . Several species
   appeared to be more abundant in the city centre whereas others showed an
   opposite tendency. We have found that the urbanized landscape can act as
   a filter for the bee community since some specific ecological traits
   facilitate colonization of the city centre. Small-bodied species that
   start their activity later in the season and are not solitary preferred
   the city centre. However, bee species diversity and richness remained
   stable across the urban gradient indicating some advantages of being a
   city dwelling bee. We suggest that a city can be a very important
   habitat for a diverse bee fauna and that conservation of a wide range of
   habitats of different urbanization levels seems to be the most suitable
   strategy for conservation of bee diversity in cities.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization of natural habitats is considered to have large impacts on
   local plant populations and their associated pollinator faunas, which
   are expected to cause changes in both plant-pollinator interactions and
   increased pollen limitation. This study investigated the effects of
   increasing intensity of urban land use on pollinator diversity, flower
   visitation rates and reproductive success in Digitalis purpurea. To this
   end, we set up experimental populations of D. purpurea in three
   urban-rural gradients and contrasted these against two large, natural
   populations. In the experimental populations we quantified the number of
   flower visits per 20 min and applied supplemental hand-pollinations to
   determine the impact of pollen limitation on fruit-level seed set. We
   found no impact of urbanization intensity on pollinator diversity at all
   locations studied, and also the number of flower visits did not differ
   significantly between urban and rural populations. Reproductive success
   appeared, however, pollen limited in all sites, even in the large and
   optimal reference populations. This led us to conclude that the pollen
   limitation was caused by a bet-hedging strategy of the species rather
   than by insufficient pollination. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Genetic diversity among 95 watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) ecotypes was
   evaluated and compared with representative Chinese, American, Japanese,
   and Russian watermelon cultigens, landraces, and a wild watermelon
   relative (Trichosanthes kirilowii).Open-pollinated, hybrid, and inbred
   lines were included for most of the ecotypes and are hereafter
   collectively referred to as cultigens unless an ecotype group is being
   discussed. Morphological characteristics (including days to flower,
   female to male flower ratio, branch number, fruit length and diameter
   ratio, fruit soluble solid content, fruit yield, and simple sequence
   repeat (SSR) markers were used to estimate genetic diversity. Of 398
   watermelon primer pairs tested, 9.5\% (38) produced polymerase chain
   reaction amplicons in watermelon. Of these 38 primer pairs, the average
   number of polymorphic bands among the 96 cultigens was 2.4, even with 12
   primer pairs demonstrating monomorphic banding patterns. Based on the
   SSR data, the genetic similarity coefficients were calculated and a
   dendrogram constructed. All cultigens were clustered to six groups. The
   wild species and landraces formed distant clusters from the cultivated
   watermelon. The genetic similarity coefficients within the Chinese
   cultigens ranged from 0.37 to 0.99, but except for a wild relative to
   watermelon, most cultigens were closely related. The genetic distance
   among non-Chinese cultigens ranged from 0.67 to 0.91 with an average of
   0.88. When combined morphological traits and molecular traits were
   assessed, Russian and U.S. fruit were more genetically similar to each
   other than to Chinese and Japanese cultigens. Crossing Russian and/or
   U.S. cultigens with Chinese or Japanese cultigens should thus improve
   genetic diversity and introduce new traits for the resulting watermelon
   cultigens.}},

Abstract = {{Continued habitat destruction in lowland areas of the Western Cape,
   South Africa, due to urbanization has reduced Roella ciliata to a few
   isolated populations and it is unknown whether this endemic shrublet
   will persist. Here, we examine the reproductive biology of a small
   population of R. ciliata occurring in a residential nature reserve 30 km
   east of Cape Town to provide baseline information for future studies.
   Data were recorded on the functional structure of the flower, duration
   of the morphological gender phases, floral visitor profile and the
   relationship between breeding system and habitat. Observations revealed
   that this species possesses reproductive characteristics typical of
   Campanulaceae such as dichogamy, protandry and secondary pollen
   presentation via pollen collecting hairs. Floral longevity ranges
   between 1 and 3 days. Anthesis occurs in synchronicity at 0700 hours and
   individual flowers close between 0930 and 1500 hours daily. The
   staminate phase lasts between 2 and 29 h and is significantly influenced
   by the removal of pollen by floral visitors, while the pistillate phase
   lasts between 21 and 69 h. R. ciliata maintains a generalized,
   entomophilous pollination system although floral visitors are generally
   scarce. Despite some intraspecific variation, the pollen/ovule ratio
   indicates that R. ciliata has a facultatively autogamous breeding
   system, in contrast to its floral attributes which might favour
   xenogamy. This reproductive mechanism may ensure survival under these
   habitat conditions and could represent a shift from outcrossing to
   selfing at the cost of reducing genetic variation over time.}},

Abstract = {{Mutualisms such as the figfig wasp mutualism are generally exploited by
   parasites. We demonstrate that amongst nonpollinating fig wasps (NPFWs)
   parasitic on Ficus citrifolia, a species of Idarnes galls flowers and
   another species feeds on galls induced by other wasps killing their
   larvae. The galling wasp inserts its ovipositor through the fig wall
   into the fig cavity. The ovipositor then follows a sinuous path and is
   introduced through the stigma and style of the flower. The egg is
   deposited between the integument and nucellus, in the exact location
   where the pollinating mutualistic wasp would have laid its egg. Gall
   induction is a complex process. In contrast, the path followed by the
   ovipositor of the other species is straightforward: attacking a larva
   within a developed gall poses different constraints. Shifts in feeding
   regime have occurred repeatedly in NPFWs. Monitoring traits associated
   with such repeated evolutionary shifts may help understand underlying
   functional constraints. (c) 2012 The Linnean Society of London,

   bee in each site was (> 50\%). The primary tree species used by the bees
   were spp. (Moraceae, 37.8\%) and (Boraginaceae, 13.5\%). The nest
   entrance height of (96 +/- 19 cm) was different than the other species,
   and this bee was the only one that used all different nesting sites.
   Volatiles analyzed by gas chromatography from pollen collected by the
   stingless bees differed between bee species, but were highly similar in
   respect to the fragrances of the pollen collected by the same species at

Abstract = {{In Citrus, self-incompatibility (SI) regulation is gametophytic, and
   this phenomenon is an economically critical problem for some Citrus
   cultivars without high parthenocarpic ability. Few molecular biological
   studies of SI in Citrus have been performed, and the molecular mechanism
   of SI has not been clarified. To investigate the effect of different
   stages of style development on pollen tube behavior, flower buds of
   self-incompatible `Hyuganatsu' (Citrus tamurana hort. ex Tanaka) were
   histologically assayed. When the flower buds were observed 168 hours
   after pollination, pollen tubes in the self-pollinated flower buds 1 and
   3 days before anthesis (DBA) were arrested in the upper part of the
   styles, while those in flower buds self-pollinated 5 DBA reached the
   base of the styles. These results revealed that Sun `Hyuganatsu' has not
   yet occurred in the flower buds 5 DBA, but generated in the flower buds
   3 DBA. To search SI-related pistil proteins in Citrus, we profiled a
   number of protein expressions in `Hyuganatsu' styles of 1, 3, and 5 DBA
   by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
   One-hundred thirty-eight protein spots were significantly different in
   abundance among the three stages, and 17 up-regulated and 26
   down-regulated protein spots could be identified. Among the 17
   up-regulated proteins, nine up-regulated proteins exhibited the
   expression pattern of 1 DBA >= 3 DBA>5 DBA, a pattern which reflected
   the transmission from SC to SI, evaluated by pollen tube growth. BLASTP
   homology search against the peptide sequences of these proteins was
   carried out and predicted the proteins related to the maintenance of
   cell shape, the signaling of pollen tube growth, the flavonol
   biosynthesis, the responses to various stresses, photosynthesis, and the
   methionine metabolic process. Among the nine proteins, some may be the
   SI-related pistil proteins; however, it was not possible to determine
   the SI-related key protein of the style in Citrus.}},

Abstract = {{We can control asthma through proper clinical and environmental
   management and education. The U.S. population is growing, urbanizing and
   aging; seniors of low-to-middle income families are working and living
   longer. We conducted community-based participatory research in Visalia,
   Tulare County, California with a prospective, cross-sectional repeated
   measures design and quantitative and qualitative process; home
   environment and health-related outcomes data were collected. In this
   paper, we presented results of the air quality sampling pollen, carbon
   dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM) outdoors away from most major
   sources (agricultural fields, large pollinating trees, etc) at a
   community central site close to a mobile line source and participant
   homes in the cooling season, July, 2009. Weather was hot and dry with
   light winds; diurnal variation ranged between 65-107 degrees F (18-42
   degrees C) and 12-76\% relative humidity at the study's central site.
   Co-located active (reference) and passive (PAAS) samplers were used for
   pollen; passive monitoring for CO2 (Telaire 7001) and active sampling
   for PM were conducted. Overall, we observed spatial variability in CO2,
   fine PM (PM2.5), and pollen counts. Weekday and study week average CO2
   and PM2.5 concentrations were higher near study homes compared to
   central site sampling points, but peak measures and overnight/pre-dawn
   time period averages were elevated at the central site. Pollen counts
   were typically lower at homes even if grass, trees, flowers or potted
   plants were present compared to the central site closer to and generally
   downwind from commercial agricultural tree production. Data are new; the
   nine-county San Joaquin Valley has one pollen count station in the
   national network, and two of four government outdoor air monitoring
   stations in the county are in national parks. We suggest given poor air
   quality in large part due to PM adding routine pollen counts to
   regional/state agency air monitoring sites and more CO2 and PM
   monitoring. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The European wild strawberry species Fragaria vesca L., Fragaria viridis
   Weston, and Fragaria moschata Weston are sympatric and bloom
   concurrently, introducing the possibilities of cooperation and
   competition for pollinators. We studied the pollination biology of
   strawberries that were grown in rectangular plots at a field site near
   Vilnius city in Lithuania. The number of open flowers, the number of
   insects visiting flowers, and the plot area covered by strawberry plants
   were recorded. Wild strawberries were visited by solitary bees (38.5\%),
   flies (31.4\%), and other hymenopterans (21\%; ants accounted for
   approximately 98\% of this group). Coleopterans, lepidopterans and honey
   bees together represented less than 10\% of the insects recorded on
   strawberries. Fragaria viridis and F. moschata flowers were more
   attractive to pollinators than those of F. vesca. The main visitors of
   F. viridis were small solitary bees; those of F. moschata were ants,
   while F. vesca flowers were visited by solitary bees, ants and flies in
   comparable numbers. We discuss competition for pollinators and the
   possible impact of climate fluctuation on strawberry-pollinator
   interactions.}},

   from other citrus cultivars grown nearby. To solve this problem using a
   biotechnological approach we aim at the destruction of ovules and/or
   seeds by directing the expression of a toxic gene using the promoter of
   an ovule and/or seed specific gene. With the purpose of isolating this
   kind of genes we constructed two cDNA libraries from ovules and seeds at
   different developmental stages of the Clementine mandarin (Citrus
   clementina cv. Clemenules). A total of 1,014 ESTs from the ovule library
   and 1,042 ESTs from the seed library were generated, with a novelty
   percentage of 27\% and 36\% among the Spanish Citrus Functional Genomic
   Project (CFGP) ESTs database, respectively. Quantitative PCR analysis
   confirmed nearly specific expression in ovule and/or seed of two genes,
   TRANSPARENT TESTA16 (CcTT16) and TRANSPARENT TESTA7 (CcTT7). Expression
   of these two genes is restricted to early seed development, and is
   localized in the embryo sac and endothelium. The promoters of those
   genes may be useful to genetically engineer citrus species to avoid seed
   formation in fruits of commercial varieties.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators play a key role within most terrestrial communities in
   maintaining plant populations, as well as pollinating many agricultural
   crops for seed and fruit production. The mobility of pollinating animals
   is significant to their importance but we know little about how
   landscape structure influences pollinator movements. Linear landscape
   features such as hedgerows and embankments are conspicuous features of
   agricultural landscape structure and are important artificial habitats
   in their own right. However, there has been some debate as to the
   function of these landscape elements as corridors between larger
   expanses of semi-natural habitat separated by urban and agricultural
   habitats. Few studies have specifically studied insect flight responses
   to linear landscape elements. By observing bumblebee flight behaviour
   along hedgerows and, by creating a medium-scale experimental array of
   flower patches using an artificial linear feature, we examined whether
   such structures can elicit an oriented flight response along them and
   therefore facilitate insect movement through the landscape. We found
   that both hedgerows and artificial linear landscape features can
   influence the flight directions of bumblebees (Bombus spp. Hymenoptera,
   Apidae), one of Europe's most important groups of pollinators. A
   bioassay experiment in which Salvia pratensis (Lamiaceae) was planted
   into landscape patches with differing numbers of connecting hedgerows
   showed that this directional response can have a profound effect on
   plant reproductive success plants had increased pollinator activity,
   pollen receipt and subsequent seed set in patches with more connections.
   The overall hedgerow connectedness of a landscape is therefore important
   both to bumblebee movement and to those plants which depend on
   bumblebees for pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{Native from the Brazilian cerrado and showing high morphological
   variability for fruit and size, the bushy cashew (Anacardium humile St.
   Hill.) produce fruits that are widely accepted by the local population,
   that are attracted because of its peculiar characteristics like size,
   unique flavor and potential for sustainable use by producers and
   industry. The limited production of seeds, caused by low pollination and
   high animal and insect predatory activity, makes the species propagation
   more difficult. The knowledge of the genetic variability of the bushy
   cashew is important to maximize the use of its genetic resources to
   future programs of improvement and conservation of the species. In this
   report, the genetic variability of 122 accesses of A. humile coming from
   11 cities (origin) from the Cerrado of the states of Goias and Mato
   Grosso was quantified through RAPD markers. The genetic similarities
   were estimated from the binary matrix, being processed cluster analysis
   and graphic dispersion from the distance matrix. The primers with bigger
   expression were OPA11 and 08. The ten primers used generated 157 bands,
   being 156 polymorphic (99\%), with an average of 5.6 bands/primer. It
   was detected a great variability in the towns, being the polymorphism
   higher than 90\%, except the ones originated from Jatai-GO. The distance
   between the accesses ranged from 0.138 to 0.561, with an average of
   0.370, being the lowest values registered between the accessions of
   Mineiros-GO and Serranopolis-GO. The accessions of Caiaponia-GO and
   Santo Antonio do Descoberto-GO were the most distant genetically. The
   total dissimilarity between the accesses ranged from 0.103 to 0.796,
   with averages of 0.390. The accesses 87 and 114 from Serranopolis-GO and
   Santo Antonio do Descoberto-GO, respectively, were the most distant

Abstract = {{In family Rubiaceae distyly is very common, and large variation in
   heterostyly characteristics has been previously documented. Analysis of
   these variations, even within a species, is very useful to our

   For this reason, the goal of this study is to investigate the floral
   morphology and diallelic incompatibility system of three populations of
   Psychotria carthagenensis. The three studied populations of P.
   carthagenensis occur in forest fragments in protected areas in an urban
   matrix in the Municipality of Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul State,
   Brazil. Reciprocal position of style length and stamen height was found
   in populations, and in general short-styled flowers were larger than
   long-styled flowers. All populations presented 1: 1 morph ratio between
   short-styled and long-styled flowers. Regarding breeding system, flowers
   of P. carthagenensis were self-compatible and compatible within plants
   of the same morph, and there was no pollen limitation in the populations
   in any case. In only one of the populations were there differences in
   the extent of compatibility between morphs, with the long-styled morph
   being more self-compatible than the short-styled morph. The reproductive
   strategy of these populations can be advantageous in case of fluctuation
   of pollinator activity.}},

Abstract = {{Introduced bees may compete with native fauna, spread parasites or
   pathogens to commercial bee hives, or increase the fecundity of
   introduced weeds. Therefore, the recent detection of Halictus
   smaragdulus, native to the western Palaearctic, in the Hunter Valley
   region of New South Wales (NSW, Australia) is cause for concern.
   However, it is currently difficult to justify control measures, as there
   is little known on its ecology, impacts and distribution. Determining
   the current distribution is fundamental to managing introduced species,
   yet this is difficult with inconspicuous species such as H. smaragdulus,
   especially as recent introductions are often found in low densities. We
   demonstrated how a combination of approaches could be used to improve
   the identification of occupied locations in NSW, including bioclimatic
   envelope models, proximity to known populations, and observed habitat
   preferences. Members of the public were also trained to collect
   specimens and improve overall survey efficiency. Bees were collected
   using pan traps and sweep netting. H. smaragdulus was detected at 44 new
   locations, extending the known distribution from similar to 1,250 to
   46,800 km(2). While bioclimatic envelope models helped guide survey
   locations, species detectability was higher when observed habitat
   preferences and proximity to known populations were also considered. We
   also demonstrated that with training via the internet and appropriate
   procedures for returning specimens in the mail, members of the public
   could successfully collect this small and inconspicuous invertebrate,
   with potential applications for other similar species.}},

Abstract = {{Urban environments contain habitats for flowering plants and their
   pollinating animal species. It is, however, unclear how the urban matrix
   influences plant-pollinator processes. We recorded plant diversity,
   floral abundance, flower visitor diversity and plot visits at 89 plant

   site was analyzed for the landscape metrics edge density and the extent
   of green area up to 200 m radius. The correlation between edge density
   and bee diversity and visitation frequency varied over the entire
   spatial range, while the correlation for syrphid diversity and
   visitation frequency levelled off at 80 m radius. In contrast, the
   correlations with green area were more consistent, with bee diversity
   levelling off after 100 m, while syrphid diversity and visits continued
   to increase. The variation in the correlation of bee visits was partly
   accounted for by the large contribution of honeybees. Plant diversity
   significantly affected bee diversity and visits, and syrphid visits.
   Floral abundance had a positive effect on bee visits and bee diversity.
   Syrphid diversity had a negative interaction with floral abundance and
   green area. The extent of green area increased bee diversity and visits,
   and syrphid visits, while edge density reduced visitation by bees. This
   study showed that plant diversity and floral abundance in urban

   area and edge density are important urban mosaic attributes that affect
   pollinator abundance and visitation frequency at multiple scales.}},

Title = {{Comparative transcriptome analysis of stylar canal cells identifies
   novel candidate genes implicated in the self-incompatibility response of
   Citrus clementina}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Reproductive biology in citrus is still poorly understood.
   Although in recent years several efforts have been made to study
   pollen-pistil interaction and self-incompatibility, little information
   is available about the molecular mechanisms regulating these processes.
   Here we report the identification of candidate genes involved in
   pollen-pistil interaction and self-incompatibility in clementine (Citrus
   clementina Hort. ex Tan.). These genes have been identified comparing
   the transcriptomes of laser-microdissected stylar canal cells (SCC)
   isolated from two genotypes differing for self-incompatibility response
   ('Comune', a self-incompatible cultivar and `Monreal', a self-compatible
   mutation of `Comune').
   Results: The transcriptome profiling of SCC indicated that the
   differential regulation of few specific, mostly uncharacterized
   transcripts is associated with the breakdown of self-incompatibility in
   `Monreal'. Among them, a novel F-box gene showed a drastic up-regulation
   both in laser microdissected stylar canal cells and in self-pollinated
   whole styles with stigmas of `Comune' in concomitance with the arrest of
   pollen tube growth. Moreover, we identify a non-characterized gene
   family as closely associated to the self-incompatibility genetic program
   activated in `Comune'. Three different aspartic-acid rich (Asp-rich)
   protein genes, located in tandem in the clementine genome, were
   over-represented in the transcriptome of `Comune'. These genes are
   tightly linked to a DELLA gene, previously found to be up-regulated in
   the self-incompatible genotype during pollen-pistil interaction.
   Conclusion: The highly specific transcriptome survey of the stylar canal
   cells identified novel genes which have not been previously associated
   with self-pollen rejection in citrus and in other plant species.
   Bioinformatic and transcriptional analyses suggested that the mutation
   leading to self-compatibility in `Monreal' affected the expression of
   non-homologous genes located in a restricted genome region. Also, we
   hypothesize that the Asp-rich protein genes may act as Ca2+
   ``entrapping{''} proteins, potentially regulating Ca2+ homeostasis
   during self-pollen recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Floral nectar is regarded as the most important reward available to
   animal-pollinated plants to attract pollinators. Despite the vast amount
   of publications on nectar properties, the role of nectar as a natural
   bacterial habitat is yet unexplored. To gain a better understanding of
   bacterial communities inhabiting floral nectar, culture-dependent and
   -independent (454-pyrosequencing) methods were used. Our findings
   demonstrate that bacterial communities in nectar are abundant and
   diverse. Using culture-dependent method we showed that bacterial
   communities of nectar displayed significant variation among three plant
   species: Amygdalus communis, Citrus paradisi and Nicotiana glauca. The
   dominant class in the nectar bacterial communities was
   Gammaproteobacteria. About half of the isolates were novel species (<
   97\% similarities of the 16S rRNA gene with known species). Using
   454-pyrosequencing we demonstrated that nectar microbial community are
   distinct for each of the plant species while there are no significant
   differences between nectar microbial communities within nectars taken
   from different plants of the same species. Primary selection of the
   nectar bacteria is unclear; it may be affected by variations in the
   chemical composition of the nectar in each plant. The role of the rich
   and diverse nectar microflora in the attraction-repulsion relationships
   between the plant and its nectar consumers has yet to be explored.}},

Title = {{Pollination success of Lotus corniculatus (L.) in an urban context}},
Journal = {{ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{94-100}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Most anthropogenic activities are known to have deleterious effects on
   pollinator communities. However, little is known about the influence of
   urbanization on pollination ecosystem services.
   Here, we assessed the pollination service on Lotus corniculatus (L), a
   self-sterile, strictly entogamous Fabaceae commonly observed in urban
   and suburban areas. We assessed the pollination success of artificial
   Lotus corniculatus populations at three levels: at large scale, along an
   urbanization gradient; at intermediate scale, based on landscape
   fragmentation within a 250 m radius and at local scale based on floral
   resource abundance and local habitat type.
   The main findings were that the pollination success, when assessed with
   the number of fruit produced per inflorescence, was lower in urban areas
   than in suburban ones, and was negatively affected by the number of
   impervious spaces in the neighborhood. The relationship between the
   number of fruits and the distance to the nearest impervious space was
   either positive or negative, depending on the gray/green ratio (low vs.
   high). Finally, on a local scale, floral resource abundance had a
   negative effect on pollination success when L corniculatus populations
   were located in paved courtyards, and a positive one when they were
   located in parks.
   Pollination success seems to be explained by two intertwined gradients:
   landscape fragmentation estimated by the number of impervious spaces in
   a 250 m radius around L corniculatus populations, and the behavior of
   bumblebees toward birdsfoot trefoil and floral displays, which appears
   to differ depending on whether a neighborhood is densely or sparsely
   urbanized. An abundance of attracting floral resources seems to enhance
   pollination success for L corniculatus if it is not too isolated from
   other green spaces.
   These results have important implications for the sustainability of
   pollination success in towns by identifying local and landscape factors
   that influence reproductive success of a common plant. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The cultural practice of removal of the secondary-lateral branch of
   watermelon during the production in greenhouse requires intensive input
   of human labor. Secondary-lateral branch removal practices were examined
   in horizontally trained two watermelon cultivars (Citrullus lanatus),
   `Sambock-gul' and `Speed-honey' to determine the comparative differences
   in labor input as well as to understand their impact on plant and fruit
   growth and fruit sugar accumulation. Two experiments were conducted.
   Experiment 1 consisted of two treatments for plants trained with one
   main stem and two lateral branches: removal of the entire
   secondary-lateral branch or removal of the secondary-lateral branch
   below the fruit set node (partial removal). Experiment 2 consisted of
   three treatments for plants trained with either two or three lateral
   branches after topping the main stem: removal of the entire
   secondary-lateral branch, removal of the secondary-lateral branch below
   fruit set node, or removal of the secondary-lateral branch below the 5th
   node above fruit set node. Results showed that removal of the
   secondary-lateral branch below the fruit set node lowered human labor
   input by 50\% compared with removal of the entire secondary-lateral
   branch. Additionally, some physiological benefits were also found for
   the plant treated by partial removal of the secondary-lateral branch.
   While fruit growth rate and fruit sucrose accumulation were much slower
   than those under other treatments until 3 weeks after pollination, 4
   weeks after pollination sucrose accumulation started to increase
   steeply, and reached the highest concentration observed, 18.2 mg center
   dot mL(-1). A greater increase in the length of fine roots, 0.2 mm in
   diameter, was observed under the partial removal treatment than for the
   entire removal treatment. During the fruit ripening period, the younger
   and developing leaves on secondary-lateral branches had a higher growth
   rate and higher photosynthetic activity than those of leaves on lateral
   branches. The integrated data indicate that active leaves on the
   secondary-lateral branch are likely to compete with the fruit as a sink
   during the fruit growing period, leading to slow fruit growth. However,
   during fruit ripening, the leaves on the secondary-lateral branch are
   likely to become a supportive source of carbon, leading to enhancement
   of sucrose accumulation in fruit.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination of pummelo (Citrus grandis L. Osbeck) pistils has been
   studied in planta by adding compatible and self-incompatible (SI) pollen
   to the stigma surface. The pollen germination has been monitored inside
   the pistil by fluorescent microscopy showing SI altered morphologies
   with irregular depositions of callose in the tube walls, and heavy
   callose depositions in enlarged tips. The polyamine (PA) content as
   free, perchloric acid (PCA)-soluble and -insoluble fractions and
   transglutaminase (TGase) activity have been analyzed in order to deepen
   their possible involvement in the progamic phase of plant reproduction.
   The conjugated PAs in PCA-soluble fraction were definitely higher than
   the free and the PCA-insoluble forms, in both compatible and SI
   pollinated pistils. In pistils, pollination caused an early decrease of
   free PAs and increase of the bound forms. The SI pollination, showed
   highest values of PCA-soluble and -insoluble PAs with a maximum in
   concomitance with the pollen tube arrest. As TGase mediates some of the
   effects of PAs by covalently binding them to proteins, its activity,
   never checked before in Citrus, was examined with two different assays.
   In addition, the presence of glutamyl-PAs confirmed the enzyme assay
   data and excluded the possibility of a misinterpretation. The SI
   pollination caused an increase in TGase activity, whereas the compatible
   pollination caused its decrease. Similarly to bound PAs, the
   glutamyl-PAs and the enzyme activity peaked in the SI pollinated pistils
   in concomitance with the observed block of the pollen tube growth,
   suggesting an involvement of TGase in SI response.}},

Abstract = {{Most of peach and nectarine cultivars are propagated traditionally on
   seedling rootstocks in Turkey. For this purpose, `Uzunoglu' peach
   {[}Prunus persica L. (Batsch)] has been used extensively for long years.
   The fruits of `Uzunoglu' peach are having no commercial value except
   good rootstock characteristics. The objectives of this study were to
   compare the isozyme polymorphism and nuclear DNA content variation in
   free-pollinated peach seedling populations. During the study, isozyme
   variation was surveyed for five enzymes including alcohol dehydrogenase
   (ADH, EC 1.1.1), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH, EC 1.1.1.42), malate
   dehydrogenase (MDH, EC 1.11.1.37), peroxidase (PRX, EC 1.11.1.7) and
   phosphogluco mutase (PGM, EC 2.7.5.1) in the seedlings. Moreover, genome
   size (C-value) was measured in peach seedling rootstocks. Cell nuclei
   were isolated from leaf tissues of the seedlings and then fluorescence
   intensities were measured on propidium iodide stained nuclei by using
   `Tahiti' lime {[}Citrus latifolia Tan.] and mungbean {[}Vigna radiata
   `Berken'] as internal reference standard by flow cytometry. According to
   the obtained results, isozyme variation was detected in 5 isozyme
   systems resulting 7 loci and 13 alleles. Isozyme polymorphism has only
   been observed in malate dehydrogenase profiles. Results obtained from
   flow cytometric analysis indicated that all analyzed seedlings were
   found to be diploid genomes with 0.574 pg/2C value in average. The study
   demonstrates the value of clonal rootstocks for eliminating of genetic
   variability within seedling rootstocks.}},

Abstract = {{Production of seedless citrus fruits is required for the fresh market
   because consumers do not accept seedy fruits. Development of new
   seedless mandarin cultivars has a high priority for many citrus
   industries worldwide. The recovery of triploid hybrids is the most
   promising approach to achieve this goal, since triploids have a very low
   pollen and ovule fertility and usually are seedless or produce very low
   numbers of seeds, and do not induce the formation of seeds in other
   cultivars by cross pollination. The objective of our breeding program is
   to produce new high quality easy peeling and seedless mandarin
   cultivars. Citrus triploid plants can be recovered by 2xx4x sexual
   hybridizations. Triploid embryos are found in normal and undeveloped
   seeds that do not germinate under greenhouse conditions. Extensive
   breeding programs based on this type of hybridization require very
   effective methodologies for recovery of new tetraploid parents, embryo
   rescue and ploidy evaluation. Different approaches have been implemented
   to obtain new tetraploid parents. Spontaneous autotetraploid plants of
   apomictic genotypes have been selected from seedbeds by flow cytometry
   and autotetraploid plants of non apomictic genotypes have been obtained

Title = {{Understanding the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway: Observation of four
   color variants of developing watermelon fruit}},
Journal = {{ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{425-434}},
Abstract = {{The carotenoid biosynthetic pathway regulatory mechanisms leading to
   lycopene accumulation are well defined in the model fruit, tomato
   (Lycopersicon esculentum L.). The regulatory mechanisms leading to
   accumulation of other carotenoids and flesh colors, however, are poorly
   understood. The variety of flesh colors available in watermelon
   (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. \& Nakai) fruit makes it ideal for
   investigating the regulation of the full pathway. Carotenoid
   accumulation was measured in seven watermelon varieties, representing
   four flesh colors and two ploidy levels, throughout fruit maturation. We
   found that the putative regulatory mechanisms controlling lycopene
   accumulation in red-fleshed fruit follows the same regulatory patterns
   as the other flesh color mutants with differing predominant carotenoids.
   In general, products downstream of the predominant carotenoid for each
   color mutant accumulate until a ``breaker stage{''} (approx. 20 days
   post pollination) at which time the major carotenoid and its precursors
   accumulate and downstream products diminish. Consistent with other
   reports, triploid varieties generally had higher concentrations of
   carotenoids than diploids (an average of 1.5 and 4.0 times in red and
   orange flesh, respectively). Interestingly, triploid watermelon
   demonstrated different carotenoid developmental patterns, suggesting the
   increased carotenoid content is controlled early on in fruit
   development. Analyzing the carotenoid accumulation in developing fruit
   suggests that canary yellow-fleshed watermelon have a fully functional
   carotenoid pathway, red fruit have a nonfunctional beta-cyclase gene,
   and orange and salmon yellow fruit have reduced- or non-functional
   phytoene desaturase and/or carotenoid isomerase genes. This improved
   understanding of the biosynthetic pathway regulation will help when
   planning traditional breeding and biotechnological techniques to improve
   carotenoid content in watermelon and other carotenoid-containing
   species.}},

   industries of South Africa. The improved material is also being made
   available to our immediate neighbours as well as the rest of the world
   (e. g. the Eureka! Seedless Lemon (TM)), and therefore makes a
   significant contribution towards forex earned. Comprehensive breeding
   and/or evaluation programmes are being carried out on many citrus
   varieties as well as other major subtropical crops such as guava,
   banana, litchi, macadamia, mango, papaya, passion fruit and pineapple as
   well as other minor crops. Furthermore, rootstock breeding programmes
   are being conducted for citrus, litchi and mango. All these species are
   naturally cross-pollinating, possess a large capacity for genetic
   variability and can be produced vegetatively. The breeding and
   evaluation section of the division has produced a number of new fruit
   selections, many of which have been registered with Plant Breeders'
   Rights (PBR). The major achievements of the division with regard to a
   number of tropical and subtropical crops and other initiatives will be

Abstract = {{Poor yield is one of the biggest problems with the production of pears
   in Brazil. The absence of fertilization in flowers of pear, results in a
   lower fruit set and thus reduces the productivity of the orchard. When
   pollination is insufficient, it is necessary to use bioregulators to
   improve this situation. The objective of the present study was to
   evaluate the effects of different products in increasing fruit set and
   productivity of `Williams', `Red Bartlett' and `Packham's Triumph'
   (Pyrus communis L.) pears. The experiment was conducted in Sao Joaquim
   city (28 degrees 17' S, 49 degrees 56' W, altitude 1350 m), Santa
   Catarina State, Brazil. The experimental design was conducted in a
   randomized block design. The rate of fruit set was determine (R) two
   months after the application of the products. The treatments were: 1)
   Promalin (R) (1 ml L-1) at full bloom; 2) Promalin (R) (0.3 ml L-1)
   applied at the beginning, full and end of the bloom; 3) Prohexadione-Ca
   (0.65 g L-1) at full bloom; 4) Prohexadione-Ca (1.25 g L-1) at full
   bloom; 5) Prohexadione-Ca (2.5 g L-1); 6) ReTain (R) (2 g L-1) 15 days
   after the full bloom; 7) Promalin (R) (1 ml L-1) at full bloom + ReTain
   (R) (2 g L-1) 15 days after the full bloom; 8) Promalin (R) (1 ml L-1) +
   ReTain (R) (2 g L-1) at full bloom; 9) Promalin (R) (1 ml L-1) +
   Prohexadione-Ca (0.65 g L-1) at full bloom; and 10) Control (water). The
   use of growth regulators is necessary to increase the fruit set,
   productivity and, therefore, profitability of European pears in the
   environmental conditions of southern Brazil. The application of Promalin
   (R) (1 ml L-1) at full bloom + ReTain (R) (2 g L-1) 15 days after the
   full bloom, was the most successful for `Packham's Triumph' and
   `Williams'. The application of Prohexadione-Ca (2.5 g L-1) at full
   bloom, was the most appropriate for ` Red Bartlett'.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-pollination response in olive varies according to the genotype,
   environment and management. The index of self-incompatibility (ISI)
   measures such cross-pollination response in terms of fruit set. Here, we
   present the comparison of ISI values of `Arbequina' trees located in two
   different sites (Tabernas and La Canada de San Urbano, Almeria, Spain)
   and years (2002 and 2003). The results show that cross-pollination
   response differed extraordinarily depending on the site and the year.
   ISI in La Canada was 0.03, while in Tabernas, ISI was 1.51 (year 2002)
   and 0.69 (year 2003) which allows classifying `Arbequina' either as
   totally self-incompatible (La Canada) or as self-compatible (Tabernas).
   No clear relation could be established among ISI values and parameters
   linked to flowering intensity and quality. At this regard, flowering
   levels measured by the number of inflorescences per node and quality
   estimated by the percentage of fertile inflorescence did not differ
   among locations and years. Nonetheless, `Arbequina' trees located in La
   Canada de San Urbano (ISI=0.03) produced more flowers per panicle
   (p=0.05) and presented a lower percentage of hermaphrodite flowers
   (p=0.06); both parameters were negatively related (r=-0.73, p<0.01).
   Cross-pollination response of individual `Arbequina' trees was
   positively related to the number of flowers per inflorescence fitting an
   exponential curve (r(2)=0.37, p<0.05). The results confirm that
   cross-pollination response in olive is extremely variable even for a
   single genotype and suggest that this variability is linked to flower
   fertility.}},

   soon afterwards, transferred to 70\% ethyl alcohol for subsequent
   identification. Almost 300 specimens of Africanized Apis mellifera,
   Trigona spinipes and Tetragonisca angustula were collected. The presence
   of these three species of bees in the flowers of T. granulosa suggests
   that they can be considered the main floral visitors of that vegetal
   species. T. angustula workers did not visit the flowers of T. granulosa
   between 7 and 8 a.m., but they were the main floral visitors from 4 to 5
   p.m. The workers of T. spinipes presented a very aggressive behavior
   against the Africanized A. mellifera workers on the quaresmeira flowers,
   defending the food sources with strength and efficiency and provoking a
   drastic reduction in the number of honeybee visits between 1 and 2 p.m.
   Nevertheless, they did not interfere in the opportunistic activity of
   foraging by T. angustula workers, mainly between 4 and 5 p.m. The most
   important result of this research was the detection of the Competitive
   Exclusion Principle between A. mellifera and T. spinipes species in
   relation to the foraging behavior, when they exploit the floral
   resources of T. granulosa.}},

Abstract = {{Funnel effects in breeding programmes of Pelargonium zonale hybrids are
   obvious after more than 200 years of breeding history although several
   species are expected to be ancestors of this most important bedding
   plant. Introgression of wild species is valuable for widening the gene
   pool and to increase diversity in plant characteristics. Pelargonium
   tongaense Vorster was discovered in 1983 in the northeast region of
   Natal, South Africa. This species belongs to the section Ciconium like
   the two main ancestors of the P. zonale hybrids P. zonale (L.) L'Herit.
   and P. inquinans (L.) L'Herit. In our experiments, the chromosome number
   of P. tongaense was doubled by mutagenesis (colchicine) from 2n=2x=18 to
   2n=4x=36. Subsequent cross-combination with Pelargonium zonale hybrids
   resulted in fertile F-1 plants. Self-pollination and backcrosses with
   cultivars up to the F-3 are reached so far. Strong root growth enables
   these clone selections to grow very efficient and drought tolerant as
   plants in the open planting in urban areas. The trailing character
   perfectly suits with requirements for baskets. Parallel
   cross-combination on the species levels showed heterosis effects. In
   addition, chlorophyll deficiencies could be observed.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate diversity and explain the relations of grain
   yield with its components, 31 genotypes of Agropyron desertorum were
   densely planted in randomized complete blocks design with four
   replications in climatic conditions of Arak city (Markazi Province,
   Iran). Some of the most important morphological and physiological
   attributes were measured. The data collected in two years were analysed;
   principal components analysis and cluster analysis were used to
   determine genetic distance and genotype classification. In principal
   components analysis, the specific values obtained from 1 to 5 components
   were larger than one. Totally, 75 percents of all variances justified
   the variables. In the first component, attributes of ear emergence time,
   pollination time, plant height, and forage yield, and in the second
   component, attributes including number of stems, grain yield, and
   harvest index had greater specific vector coefficients besides major
   attributes for genotype classification. In cluster analysis, genotypes
   were categorized in seven groups. According to the obtained results,
   clusters 4, 6 and 7 - in term of grain yield - and clusters 5, 6 and 7 -
   in terms of forage production - were significantly different from other
   groups. Genotypes 3477P4 and 341P11 belonging to cluster 7 were known as
   superior genotypes in terms of forage production and two genotypes 341M
   and 287P8 belonging to cluster 4 were proved to be the best genotypes in
   terms of grain production. Good agreement was observed between the
   results obtained from cluster and principal components analyses in
   scatter diagram representation of 31 genotypes based on two principal

Abstract = {{The subtropical coastal heathlands of southeast Queensland contain many
   rare and threatened species and have undergone considerable habitat loss
   in recent years due to high levels of urbanisation. We used
   morphological and microsatellite markers to investigate the reproductive
   ecology, in relation to fire, and population genetic structure of the
   endangered shrub Allocasuarina emuina. Highly significant differences (P
   < 0.001) were detected among populations for all cone-and seed-related
   morphological traits, which revealed distinct northern and southern
   groups of populations, a pattern repeated in the genetic component of
   the study. Results also indicated that the reproductive viability of A.
   emuina is more related to fire interval than population size and
   confirmed that seed viability declines with time since fire. The highest
   level of genetic diversity for the species was observed in the
   population on Mt Emu (AE4A; H-E = 0.688). Contrary to the expectations
   of population genetic theory, no relationship was found between the
   level of genetic variation and population size, density or degree of
   isolation, hinting that genetic diversity is being conserved as a result
   of polyploidy and apomixis. However, genetic signatures in the northern
   populations indicated that unidirectional dispersal of genetic material
   from the putatively refugial population on Mt Emu to the surrounding
   coastal plain has been occurring with recession of sea levels following
   the last interglacial. The findings of the study will aid in both the
   conservation of natural populations and translocations of A. emuina and
   have significant implications relating to the biogeographical history of
   a considerable number of co-occurring heathland taxa.}},

   organic compound emissions}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3777-3785}},
Abstract = {{Emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) from urban trees
   during and after blooming were measured during spring and early summer
   2009 in Boulder, Colorado. Air samples were collected onto solid
   adsorbent cartridges from branch enclosures on the tree species
   crabapple (Malus sp.), horse chestnut (Aesculus carnea, ``Ft.
   McNair{''}), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos, ``Sunburst{''}), and
   hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata, ``Pauls Scarlet{''}). These species
   constitute similar to 65\% of the insect-pollinated fraction of the
   flowering tree canopy (excluding catkin-producing trees) from the street
   area managed by the City of Boulder. Samples were analyzed for C-10-C-15
   BVOC by thermal desorption and gas chromatography coupled to a flame
   ionization detector and a mass spectrometer (GC/FID/MS). Identified
   emissions and emission rates from these four tree species during the
   flowering phase were found to vary over a wide range. Monoterpene
   emissions were identified for honey locust, horse chestnut and hawthorn.
   Sesquiterpene emissions were observed in horse chestnut and hawthorn
   samples. Crabapple flowers were found to emit significant amounts of
   benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde. Floral BVOC emissions increased with
   temperature, generally exhibiting exponential temperature dependence.
   Changes in BVOC speciation during and after the flowering period were
   observed for every tree studied. Emission rates were significantly
   higher during the blooming compared to the post-blooming state for
   crabapple and honey locust. The results were scaled to the dry mass of
   leaves and flowers contained in the enclosure. Only flower dry mass was
   accounted for crabapple emission rates as leaves appeared at the end of
   the flowering period. Total normalized (30 degrees C) monoterpene
   emissions from honey locust were higher during flowering (5.3 mu gC
   g(-1) h(-1)) than after flowering (1.2 mu gC g(-1) h(-1)). The total
   normalized BVOC emission rate from crabapple (93 mu gC g(-1) h(-1))
   during the flowering period is of the same order as isoprene emissions
   from oak trees, which are among the highest BVOC flowering period floral
   emissions observed from plants to date. These findings illustrate that
   during the relatively brief springtime flowering period, floral
   emissions constitute by far the most significant contribution to the
   BVOC flux from these tree species, some of which are leafless at this
   time. Experimental results were integrated into the MEGAN biogenic
   emission model and simulations were performed to estimate the
   contribution of floral BVOC emissions to the total urban BVOC flux
   during the spring flowering period. The floral BVOC emitted during this
   three-month simulation are equivalent to 11\% of the integrated
   monoterpene flux for the Boulder urban area.}},

Abstract = {{The stingless bees are an important component of the insect biomass in
   many tropical areas, due to their collection of nectar and pollen.
   Trigona spinipes is a widely distributed species in South America, and
   described as a pollinator of many crops that can be used in a commercial
   pollinating system. The effects of plant extracts on insects are studied
   because of the demand for organic food and their selectivity to natural
   enemies. Plant insecticides are reported as a potential agent for the
   control of insect pests, however little is known about their impact on
   beneficial insects. This study investigated the survival of Trigona
   spinipes (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Meliponini) Fabricius, after exposure to
   the leaf extracts of Azadiracha indica (Meliaceae), Lippia sidoides
   (Verbenaceae), Sapindus saponaria (Sapindaceae), Anonna squamosa

   Nordestina and AL Guarany varieties and Jatropha curcas. The extracts
   that had the greatest influence on the survival of the bees were A.
   indica at 3\% and 7\% of concentration, A. squamosa at a concentration
   of 10\% with 68.89\% survival and green leaf of R. communis at a

   effective in controlling pests, they may also affect the pollinator

Title = {{Urbanization Drives a Reduction in Functional Diversity in a Guild of
   Nectar-feeding Birds}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Urbanization is a widespread and rapidly growing threat to biodiversity,
   therefore we need a predictive understanding of its effects on species
   and ecosystem processes. In this paper we study the impact of
   urbanization on a guild of nectar-feeding birds in a biodiversity
   hotspot at the Cape of Africa. The guild of four bird species provides
   important ecosystem services by pollinating 320 plant species in the
   Cape Floral Region. Functional diversity within the guild is related to
   differences in bill length. The long-billed Malachite Sunbird
   (Nectarinia famosa) plays an irreplaceable role as the exclusive
   pollinator of plant species with long nectar tubes. We analyzed the
   composition of the guild in suburban gardens of Cape Town along a
   gradient of increasing distance from the nearest natural habitat.
   Urbanization reduces the functional diversity of the nectarivore guild.
   Malachite Sunbirds did not penetrate more than 1 km into the city,
   whereas only the short-billed Southern Double-collared Sunbirds
   (Cinnyris chalybea) occurred throughout the urbanization gradient. The
   lack of data precludes conclusions regarding the detailed responses of
   Orange-breasted Sunbirds (Anthobaphes violacea) and Sugarbirds
   (Promerops cafer), however their absence across the entire gradient is
   suggestive of high sensitivity. The functional diversity of this guild
   of pollinators can potentially be restored, but the pros and cons of
   this conservation action need to be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of Citrus floral extracts on the foraging behavior of the
   stingless bee Scaptotrigona pectoralis (Dalla Torre). Stingless bees
   have an important role as pollinators of many wild and cultivated plant
   species in tropical regions. Little is known, however, about the
   interaction between floral fragrances and the foraging behavior of
   meliponine species. Thus we investigated the chemical composition of the
   extracts of citric (lemon and orange) flowers and their effects on the
   foraging behavior of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona pectoralis. We
   found that each type of flower has its own specific blend of major
   compounds: limonene (62.9\%) for lemon flowers, and farnesol (26.5\%),
   (E)-nerolidol (20.8\%), and linalool (12.7\%) for orange flowers. In the
   foraging experiments the S. pectoralis workers were able to use the
   flower extracts to orient to the food source, overlooking plates baited
   with hexane only. However, orange flower extracts were seemingly more
   attractive to these worker bees, maybe because of the particular blend
   present in it. Our results reveal that these fragrances are very
   attractive to S. pectoralis, so we can infer that within citric orchards
   they could be important visitors in the study area; however habitat
   destruction, overuse of pesticides and the competitive override by
   managed honeybees might have put at risk their populations and thus the
   ecological services they provide to us.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of habitat fragmentation and reduced population sizes on
   ecological processes deserve more attention. In this study we examine
   pollination in rural and urban populations of Brunsvigia litoralis
   (Amaryllidaceae), an endangered endemic and a flagship species for plant
   conservation in South Africa. B. litoralis has flowers conforming to the
   bird-pollination syndrome, but the only flower visitor at the urban
   sites, the Greater Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyris afra) (1.6
   visits/flower/hour), is unable to access the nectar in the usual way due
   to a long perianth tube (38.8 mm) and resorts to robbing. Supplemental
   hand pollination was used to test for pollen limitation of seed set at
   the urban sites flowers were pollen-supplemented. Seed set in
   supplemented plants increased by more than an order of magnitude
   relative to controls. The longer-billed Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia
   famosa) was observed as the sole pollinator of B. litoralis at the rural
   site where seed set was significantly higher. Although B. litoralis
   plants are long lived, the absence of pollinators in these urban
   fragments might place populations at an extinction risk. (C) 2011 SAAB.

Abstract = {{Hyuganatsu is a self-incompatible Citrus species with no parthenocarpic
   traits. Pollinizer requirements and seedy fruit production are therefore
   a limiting factor for Hyuganatsu growers. `Nishiuchi Konatsu', a bud
   mutation of Hyuganatsu, can set fruit by self-pollination and aborts
   most seeds. To obtain a better understanding of the reproductive
   mechanisms of `Nishiuchi Konatsu', its pollen was characterized by
   pollen observation and viability testing in vitro in addition to pollen
   tube observation of the pistil following various pollination
   combinations. Furthermore, the ploidy level of `Nishiuchi Konatsu' and
   the progenies obtained after controlled pollination were analyzed using
   a flow cytometer. As a result, `Nishiuchi Konatsu' pollen was shown to
   be functional in vitro, as indicated by both the pollen germination test
   and FDA staining. A curious feature of `Nishiuchi Konatsu' pollen is
   that a giant pollen of about 42-44 mu m in diameter, which is about
   1.3-fold the average diameter of original Hyuganatsu pollen (33.4 mu m),
   was partially produced. Observation of in vivo pollen germination and
   pollen tube elongation revealed that Hyuganatsu (or `Nishiuchi Konatsu')
   x Konatsu' showed imperfect incompatibility; that is, some pollen tubes
   were able to enter the style while others could not. Flow cytometry
   analysis indicated that `Nishiuchi Konatsu' is diploid while all of its
   self-pollinated progenies, which were rarely obtained as normal seeds,
   were tetraploid. Progenies from other combinations were diploid. These
   results strongly suggest that unreduced 2n pollen production occurred in
   `Nishiuchi Konatsu'. In addition to self-compatibilty and seed abortion
   of `Nishiuchi Konatsu' self-pollination, it has been reported that the
   proportion of normal to aborted seeds differs according to the cultivar
   of the seed parent crossed with `Nishiuchi Konatsu' pollen (Honsho et
   al., 2009). Taking into account the unreduced pollen production as well
   as the effect of polyploidization on self-incompatibility and embryo
   development, we finally discussed why such a phenomenon was induced by
   pollination with `Nishiuchi Konatsu' pollen and why `Nishiuchi Konatsu'
   became self-compatible.}},

Title = {{Flower morphology, nectar traits and pollinators of Cerinthe major
   (Boraginaceae-Lithospermeae)}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{207}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{186-196}},
Abstract = {{In April and May 2010, a natural population of Cerinthe major
   (Boraginaceae-Lithospermeae) was investigated with regard to: floral
   morphology, phenology, sexual receptivity during anthesis, the
   production of nectar and its sugar and amino acid content. The
   pollinator array of this species was also investigated. Cerinthe major
   has showy, pentamerous, hermaphroditic flowers with a deep yellow
   corolla tube arranged on numerous scorpioid inflorescences. Nectar and
   pollen are the main floral rewards for pollinators. The arrangement of
   stamens limits access to nectar and promotes pollen loading onto
   pollinator bodies as they force their way towards the source of nectar.
   By limiting the direct exposure of nectar to the environment, the
   corolla tube and the arrangement of anther filaments seemingly protect
   nectar from evaporation resulting from high temperatures and low
   relative humidity during flower anthesis. The green, annular nectary
   located at the base of the ovary lobes is composed of a very thin
   epidermis enclosing a dense mass of parenchyma. The epidermis lacks
   stomata, and the thin cuticle has an irregular surface. The parenchyma
   cells do not store starch during the pre-secretory stage, suggesting
   that immediate photosynthesis is the most likely source of nectar
   carbohydrates. Generally, anthesis lasts 4-5 days; the gynoecium becomes
   fully receptive on the second day and this is synchronous with anther
   dehiscence. Since nectar production begins during the bud stage, a
   substantial volume is available for flower visitors at anthesis. Nectar
   production decreases drastically in senescent flowers and, if not
   consumed, the nectar can be re-absorbed. Analysis of sugars revealed a
   sucrose-dominant nectar (sucrose=93.18 +/- 1.35\%). Proline, GABA,
   taurine, leucine, citrulline and alanine were the main amino acids
   present and are probably implicated in pollinator flight performance.
   The bees Bombus hortorum, Anthophora sp. and Eucera sp. were constant
   and frequent visitors of C. major flowers. Moreover, the manner in which
   they interacted with the flower in order to obtain nectar and pollen
   loads was sufficient evidence for their role as pollinators. Their
   different foraging behaviours suggest that each species may promote
   differences in pollen flow both within and among individuals of the
   population. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Neotropical region to which Brazil belongs, has a great and rich
   diversity of natives bees, up to a total of 3.000 species including the
   allochtone genus Apis that by natural crossing among European and
   African races produced a hybrid called Africanized honeybee. In this
   way, beekeeping enjoys a spectacular moment with good production mainly
   of honey and propolis from Apis mellifera, causing Brazil to be
   recognized around the world as a country with great potential. Brazilian
   bee losses nevertheless remain a question, compared with countries of
   the northern hemisphere where several reports show that the vanishing of
   honeybees is associated with diseases caused by Varroa, Nosema, virus or
   pesticides. We can suggest different issues in the Brazilian situation
   that are directly influencing the honeybee population. Given the
   extension of the territory and rich flora, all possible food resources
   and nest sites for the good development of bees may be considered
   present. However, we verified that annual bee losses in the Southeast
   can reach 20-30\%, mainly due the genetic mechanisms of swarming (nest
   abandon). Many times the major factor leading to nest abandon is lack of
   food, often taken mistakenly by the untrained beekeeper as death of the
   hive caused by diseases or pesticides. Although in Brazil diseases do
   not represent an important problem for Africanized honeybees, some cases
   of presence of Nosema ceranae and Varroa destructor led the specialists
   to precaution and monitoring the colonies. In spite of this, the
   Brazilian beekeeping is managed without use of any acaricide or
   antibiotic, producing contaminant-free products. As to pesticides,
   Brazil has a particular climatic and soil condition that might
   differently affect the risk of exposure of bees to xenobiotics. For
   example, comparing the dynamics of carbamate pesticides in soil between
   Brazil and Europe, it was found that in our condition ten-fold more time
   is needed to obtain the metabolites sulfone and sulfoxide, both more
   soluble and toxic than it precursor. Comparing the pesticides
   consumption, currently Brazil has become the world leader followed by
   USA, with a total spending of 44.9\% herbicide, 28.5\% insecticide and
   22.1\% fungicide. Even with this consumption Brazil still belongs to the
   group that uses a relatively small amount of active ingredient per
   hectare, less than Japan and France. However cultures like tomato,
   potato, citrus, cotton and coffee that are often visited by bees during
   bloom, are also those where the use of pesticides is needed for the pest
   control. Thus, little is known yet about pesticide losses of the
   Brazilian bees! What are real effects of pesticides, toxic plants,
   diseases, genetic improvement, beekeeping management, starvation or
   interactions among these? Therefore, our local group on ecotoxicological
   assessment is trying to increase the knowledge on the pesticides hazard
   to bees (Apis and non-Apis) in order to protect these.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation of plant-pollinator interactions is important to
   preserve the mutualism that provides much of the food that humans
   consume. This interaction is at risk due to factors including climate
   change, which may shift differentially the phenology of events like
   flowering and emergence of bee-introduced diseases and parasites that
   are detrimental to pollinators,and other environmental changes. Our
   understanding of the consequences of these threats is limited by our
   lack of knowledge of the distribution and abundance of pollinator
   populations, but both honey bees and bumble bees have declined in recent
   years. Data collection by both scientists and citizen-scientists is
   helping to solve this problem, for both urban and field studies.}},

Abstract = {{Charoxus spinifer is associated in southern Florida with native fig
   trees (Ficus aurea and Ficus citrifolia). Winged adult beetles, 3.0-3.6
   mm long, mate on Ficus twigs outside the syconia (fruits), and enter the
   syconia through holes cut by male pollinating wasps. Adults and larvae
   eat adult wasps within the syconia. Ovaries hold few, large, mature
   eggs. Larvae develop through three instars. Fully grown larvae abandon
   the syconia, drop to the ground, burrow to a depth of 1.5-3.7 cm, spin a
   silken cocoon, and pupate. Pupal duration is 8-9 days. Larval
   populations are highest in May, when penultimate stage syconia (phase D)
   are most abundant, but were detected in all months except June. Charoxus
   major is reported from Veracruz, associated with Ficus lapathifolia. Its
   adults extract wasp occupants of galled fig ovaries within syconia, and
   its eggs were found singly in empty galls.}},

Title = {{Stepping-stone populations in linear landscape elements increase pollen
   dispersal between urban forest fragments}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{332-340}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims - Understanding how to ensure connectivity by gene
   flow between insect-pollinated plant populations is essential for
   designing functional ecological networks in a human-dominated matrix
   such as in urban settings. Linear landscape elements (LLEs) might
   contribute to such connectivity by increasing pollen transfer.
   Methods - Pollen dispersal was investigated for the insect-pollinated
   herb Primula elatior in urban forest remnants, using fluorescent dye as
   a pollen analogue, in three study sites comprising population pairs
   located in fragments connected or not by a wooded LLE. We examined
   whether the presence of a small patch of plants of P elatior placed
   within the LLE (stepping-stone population) might increase pollen
   dispersal compared to an LLE where P. elatior is absent.
   Key results - Dye dispersal showed a leptokurtic decay distribution,
   with most dye transfer events at short distances (80\% at less than
   15.4-114.8 m) and a maximal distance of 647.5 m. Populations not
   connected by an LLE, separated by distances of 249 m or more, did not
   exchange dye, whereas populations that were connected by LLEs (up to 602
   m) did show interpopulation dye transfer, suggesting that LLEs function
   as biological corridors facilitating dye dispersal. The presence of a
   stepping-stone population of P. elatior within the LLE increased
   between-population dye transfers (between 1.8 and 3.3 times the
   proportion of visited individuals) and deposition distances, compared to
   an LLE with no stepping stone, at least when pollen flow already
   existed.
   Conclusions - These results provide evidence that LLEs may be more
   effective for pollen dispersal when serving as both movement conduit and
   habitat. In urban settings, developing a network of core populations
   connected by LLEs comprising small, even temporary, stepping-stone
   populations should be encouraged.}},
