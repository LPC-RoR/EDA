Abstract = {{The study was conducted to determine the efficiency in producing
   spontaneous polyploids in some mandarin hybrids with different seed
   embryony. Seed formation by open pollination, frequency of spontaneous
   polyploids, and plant growth characteristics were evaluated in four
   mandarin hybrids with polyembryony such as `Amakusa', `Hayaka', and
   `Seminole' and two with monoembryony such as `Benibae' and `Harehime'.
   The mean number of the developed seeds per fruit was 10.0 and frequency
   of small seeds was 25.1\%. Polyploids were selected from plants
   germinated in vitro by a flow cytometry and confirmed by chromosome
   analysis. One triploid was produced from `Harehime', one tetraploid,
   `Amakusa', and one tetrapoid, `Benibae'. There were little differences
   in leaf shape, thickness, petiole length, and internode length between
   diploids and polyploids such as tri- or tetraploid. However, polyploids
   had larger stomata and lower density of stomata in abaxial epidermis
   than diploids. SPAS indicating chlorophyll content and photosynthetic
   rate were significantly affected by ploidy level. The results indicated
   that spontaneous polyploids might be produced by open pollination in
   some mandarin hybrids and monoembryony had higher frequency in polyploid
   occurrence than polyembryony.}},

Abstract = {{Producers of fresh fruits and vegetables face increasing production
   costs and international market competition. Growers who can offer
   high-quality watermelons {[}Citrullus lanatus (Thumb.) Matsum. \& Nakai]
   that are also highly nutritious will have better market opportunities.
   To accomplish that, germplasm must be identified that has enhanced
   phytonutrient levels. Surprisingly, there is little information on the
   genetics of nutritional quality in watermelon. The present study was
   performed on 56 watermelon cultivars, breeding lines, and PI accessions
   (hereafter collectively referred to as cultigens) to determine the
   importance of genotype and environmental effects on L-citrulline
   concentration in fruit, an amino acid that helps regulate blood
   pressure. Our results demonstrated that L-citrulline concentration was
   affected by environment and the amount of environmental effect varies
   among cultigens. The mean of fruit tested in Lane, OK, was 3.10 mg.g(-1)
   fresh weight and in College Station, TX, it was 1.67 mg.g(-1) fresh
   weight. All cultigens had a higher mean L-citrulline concentration when
   grown in Lane, OK, instead of College Station, TX. Additionally, the
   L-citrulline concentration varied considerably within cultigens; i.e.,
   `Congo' had a 1.26 to 7.21 mg.g(-1) fresh sample deviation. The cultigen
   `AU-Jubilant' had the most stable L-citrulline concentration (2.23 to
   4.03 mg.g(-1) fresh deviation) when tested from one location.
   Environment did not significantly increase within-genotype variation
   (average SE of 10 cultigens tested at each location was +/- 35.3\% for
   College Station, TX, and +/- 32.9\% for Lane, OK). L-citrulline
   concentration did not correlate with watermelon type (open-pollinated or
   Fl hybrid) or flesh color (red, orange, salmon yellow, or white).
   Differences among cultigens for L-citrulline were large (1.09 to 4.52
   mg.g(-1) fresh sample). The cultigens with the highest L-citrulline
   concentration were `Tom Watson', PI 306364, and `Jubilee'. These could
   be used to develop cultivars having a high concentration of
   L-citrulline.}},

Abstract = {{Urban areas are species-rich ecosystems. The question remains, however,
   whether urban species constitute a unique community, and thus add value
   to landscape biodiversity, or whether they are just a mixture of species
   from surrounding ecosystems. In this study, the occurrence and abundance
   of arthropods were analysed according to trophic guilds (Cerambycidae
   and Buprestidae as xylophagous species. Apiformes as pollinators,
   Neuroptera as flying predators. Araneae and Carabidae as
   surface-dwelling predators) in urban, agricultural and forest ecosystems
   in Switzerland. To assess the likely origin of arthropod fauna in Swiss
   cities, we identified character species (regular and constant
   occurrence) for ecosystems and performed ordination and cluster
   analyses. In total, we studied 10,034 specimens from 497 species and
   found that 13\% of all species and 10\% of the character species were
   predominately found in the urban ecosystems. Community analyses showed
   that the three ecosystems harbour distinct species assemblages. While
   communities at forest sites are quite dissimilar from those at urban and
   agricultural sites, these latter share more than one third of all
   character species, which indicates either that agricultural areas
   function as source habitats for urban communities or that agricultural
   species have survived urbanisation in situ. Overall, our study
   identified a distinct urban arthropod community that enriches landscape
   (gamma) diversity in Switzerland. Urban sites may provide novel habitats
   for species of former extensive agriculture, or species otherwise not,
   or scarcely, occurring in the region. The present study illuminates the
   value of urban arthropods for overall biodiversity which should be
   incorporated in planning decisions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Maize improvement for high temperature tolerance requires the reliable
   assessment of parental inbred lines and their combinations. Fifteen
   maize inbred lines were evaluated during 2007 and 2008 in Shushtar city
   (Khuzestan Province). The inbred lines were planted at two dates: 6
   July, to coincide heat stress with pollination time; and 27 July, as
   normal planting to avoid high temperature during pollination and grain
   filling period. In addition, 28 hybrids from a combination of eight
   selected lines, were evaluated under the same conditions in 2008. Five
   stress tolerance indices, including mean productivity (MP), stress
   tolerance (TOL), stress susceptibility (SSI), stress tolerance index
   (STI) and geometric mean productivity (GMP) were used in this study.
   Data analysis revealed that the SSI, STI and GMP indices were the more
   accurate criteria for selection of heat tolerant and high yielding
   genotypes. The positive and significant correlation of GMP and grain
   yield under both conditions revealed that this index is more applicable
   and efficient for selection of parental inbred lines in producing
   hybrids to be tolerant to high temperatures and high yielding under both
   conditions. Based on two years' data and using the STI, GMP and MP
   indices, K166B, K166A and K18xK166B proved to be the most heat tolerant
   lines and hybrid. Biplot analysis allowed us to distinguish groups of
   tolerant and sensitive inbred lines and hybrids. Based on the results of
   this study, the hybrid K18xK166B can be recommended for the Khuzestan
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Modern survivors of previously more diverse lineages are regarded as
   living fossils, particularly when characterized by morphological stasis.
   Cycads are often cited as a classic example, reaching their greatest
   diversity during the Jurassic-Cretaceous (199.6 to 65.5 million years
   ago) then dwindling to their present diversity of similar to 300 species
   as flowering plants rose to dominance. Using fossil-calibrated molecular
   phylogenies, we show that cycads underwent a near synchronous global
   rediversification beginning in the late Miocene, followed by a slowdown
   toward the Recent. Although the cycad lineage is ancient, our timetrees
   indicate that living cycad species are not much older than similar to 12
   million years. These data reject the hypothesized role of dinosaurs in
   generating extant diversity and the designation of today's cycad species

Abstract = {{The red mason bee (Osmia bicornis L) is a common wild bee in urban
   environments which contributes to early-season pollination. We know only
   little about how any species of wild bee in cities responds to resource
   distribution or landscape structure and the urban habitat(s) that they
   prefer. We employed a citizen science approach to investigate drivers
   behind the spatial distribution of this solitary bee in the urban region
   of Leipzig (Germany). Volunteers hung trap nests at different locations
   and collected information on eight local, microsite conditions (such as
   sun exposure, attachment position, local flower availability). We
   derived 14 landscape factors from a digital GIS biotope data map (e.g.
   distance to flower sites and urban matrix properties such as size and
   edge length of patches). Both occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis
   were then analyzed using a combination of machine learning and multiple
   (logistic) regression. The results indicate that the red mason bee is
   ubiquitous in urban area but clearly profits from nearby floral
   resources. Although we expected a balanced influence of landscape
   factors and microsite conditions, we found that hang location of the
   trap nest was most important, followed by sun exposure. Cities with many
   fine-scaled floral resources (such as private gardens but not parks) and
   an open housing structure with higher sun exposure between buildings
   provide a good environment for cavity-nesting bees such as O. bicornis.
   In places without suitable nesting opportunities, artificial nest can
   support the bees. 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to loss of natural habitats, human-dominated green spaces are likely
   to increase in importance for biodiversity support. We assessed the
   potential value of urban ``green roofs{''} for native pollinator
   conservation in the Chicago region, comparing them with reference
   habitats of tallgrass prairie natural areas and traditional city-park
   green spaces. We found that native bees are present on green roofs,
   though at lower abundance and diversity than in reference habitats.
   Green-roof and prairie bee communities were distinct from each other,
   while those in parks were intermediate and similar to the other two
   habitat types. Bee-community patterns were related to habitat
   characteristics at both the site and landscape scales. Overall, bee
   abundance and species richness increased with greater proportions of
   green space in the surrounding landscape. However, this relationship
   disappeared in cases where green space was dominated by turf grass. At
   the site scale, bees benefited from greater plant diversity, and bee and
   plant-community composition were significantly correlated. Green roofs
   are potentially valuable sites for bee conservation in urban areas,
   particularly if planted with diverse native forbs to provide foraging
   resources, and designed to accommodate bees with different nesting
   habits. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The architecture of mutualistic networks facilitates coexistence of
   individual participants by minimizing competition relative to
   facilitation(1,2). However, it is not known whether this benefit is
   received by each participant node in proportion to its overall
   contribution to network persistence. This issue is critical to
   understanding the trade-offs faced by individual nodes in a
   network(3-5). We address this question by applying a suite of structural
   and dynamic methods to an ensemble of flowering plant/insect pollinator
   networks. Here we report two main results. First, nodes contribute
   heterogeneously to the overall nested architecture of the network. From
   simulations, we confirm that the removal of a strong contributor tends
   to decrease overall network persistence more than the removal of a weak
   contributor. Second, strong contributors to collective persistence do
   not gain individual survival benefits but are in fact the nodes most
   vulnerable to extinction. We explore the generality of these results to
   other cooperative networks by analysing a 15-year time series of the
   interactions between designer and contractor firms in the New York City
   garment industry. As with the ecological networks, a firm's survival
   probability decreases as its individual nestedness contribution
   increases. Our results, therefore, introduce a new paradox into the
   study of the persistence of cooperative networks, and potentially
   address questions about the impact of invasive species in ecological
   systems and new competitors in economic systems.}},

Title = {{Pollen Competition as a Reproductive Isolation Barrier Represses
   Transgene Flow between Compatible and Co-Flowering Citrus Genotypes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{Background/Objective: Despite potential benefits granted by genetically
   modified (GM) fruit trees, their release and commercialization raises
   concerns about their potential environmental impact, and the transfer
   via pollen of transgenes to cross-compatible cultivars is deemed to be
   the greatest source for environmental exposure. Information compiled
   from field trials on GM trees is essential to propose measures to
   minimize the transgene dispersal. We have conducted a field trial of
   seven consecutive years to investigate the maximum frequency of
   pollen-mediated crop-to-crop transgene flow in a citrus orchard, and its
   relation to the genetic, phenological and environmental factors
   involved.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Three different citrus genotypes
   carrying the uidA (GUS) tracer marker gene (pollen donors) and a non-GM
   self-incompatible contiguous citrus genotype (recipient) were used in
   conditions allowing natural entomophilous pollination to occur. The
   examination of 603 to 2990 seeds per year showed unexpectedly low
   frequencies (0.17-2.86\%) of transgene flow. Paternity analyses of the
   progeny of subsets of recipient plants using 10 microsatellite (SSR)
   loci demonstrated a higher mating competence of trees from another
   non-GM pollen source population that greatly limited the mating chance
   of the contiguous cross-compatible and flowering-synchronized transgenic
   pollen source. This mating superiority could be explained by a much
   higher pollen competition capacity of the non-GM genotypes, as was
   confirmed through mixed-hand pollinations.
   Conclusions/Significance: Pollen competition strongly contributed to
   transgene confinement. Based on this finding, suitable isolation
   measures are proposed for the first time to prevent transgene outflow
   between contiguous plantings of citrus types that may be extendible to
   other entomophilous transgenic fruit tree species.}},

   pollination ecology, reproductive system, flowering phenology and floral
   visitors of Byrsonima utnbellata Mart. and B. rotunda Griseb. were
   studied in a Cerrado area, at Urbano Santos municipality, Maranhao
   State. B. umbellata presented extended flowering period (eight months)
   and B. rotunda showed brief flowering period (one month). The species
   had hermaphroditic flowers with diurnal anthesis. B. umbellata is
   facultatively self-incompatible, showing higher fruit production through
   cross-pollinators (46.6\%), and B. rotunda is mainly self-compatible,
   with fruit production in all treatments, even through agamospermy
   (60\%), although higher production was achieved in geitonogamy (90\%).
   We observed 42 and 16 species of bees in B. umbellata and B. rotunda
   flowers, respectively. Centris aenea and C. (Trachina) sp.n. were
   considered the main pollinators of B. umbellata flowers and C. aenea of
   B. rotunda. Both Byrsonima species present important ecological
   function, representing important resources to several species of bees

Abstract = {{Gametophytic self-incompatibility (SI), an important character for
   breeding seedless cultivars of Citrus, is known in pummelo, mandarin,
   and many hybrid cultivars with pummelo in their pedigrees. Only a little
   is known about the allelic variation in the self-incompatibility gene
   (S),S allele frequencies, and the genotypes of self-incompatible and
   semi-self-compatible cultivars. In this study, pollination of `Banpeiyu'
   S-1 seedlings with `Banpeiyu' and pollination between the SI seedlings
   were performed to determine homozygous Si seedlings for the S gene.
   Seventy-eight Citrus accessions, including 55 pummelo accessions, were
   pollinated with each of two homozygous S-1 seedlings (S1S1 and S2S2).
   Pollen tube arrest in the style base of their pollinated pistils
   indicated that 23 accessions, including `Banpeiyu', have an S-1 allele
   each and 16 accessions, including `Banpeiyu', have an S-2 allele each.
   Frequency of accessions with Si allele was 29.9\% (23 of 77 accessions
   examined) and Si allele frequency was 16.4\% (23 of 140 alleles
   excluding S-f allele). Frequency of accessions with S-2 allele was
   21.3\% (16 of 75 accessions examined) and S-2 allele frequency was
   11.6\% (16 of 138 alleles excluding Sf allele). Pummel() accessions
   collected from Kagoshima Prefecture had Si alleles with two and half
   times higher frequency (56.3\%) than that in all accessions examined. Of
   the 79 accessions, six accessions ('Banpeiyu', `Iriki Buntan',
   `Kaopang', Nagashima Buntan No. 6, Nagashima Buntan No. 7, and `Soyu')

Abstract = {{The diversity and abundance of wild bees ensures the delivery of
   pollination services and the maintenance of ecosystem diversity. As
   previous studies carried out in Central Europe and the US have shown,
   bee diversity and abundance is influenced by the structure and the
   composition of the surrounding landscape. Comparable studies have so far
   not been carried out in the Mediterranean region. The present study
   examines the influence of Mediterranean landscape context on the
   diversity and abundance of wild bees. To do this, we sampled bees in 13
   sites in olive groves on Lesvos Island, Greece. Bees were assigned to
   five categories consisting of three body size groups (small, medium and
   large bees), the single most abundant bee species (Lasioglossum
   marginatum) and all species combined. The influence of the landscape
   context on bee abundance and species richness was assessed at five radii
   (250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 m) from the centre of each site. We found
   that the abundance within bee groups was influenced differently by
   different landscape parameters and land covers, whereas species richness
   was unaffected. Generally, smaller bees' abundance was impacted by
   landscape parameters at smaller scales and larger bees at larger scales.
   The land cover that influenced bee abundance positively was olive grove,
   while phrygana, conifer forest, broad-leaved forest, cultivated land,
   rock, urban areas and sea had mostly negative or no impact. We stress
   the need for a holistic approach, including all land covers, when
   assessing the effects of landscape context on bee diversity and
   abundance in the Mediterranean.}},

Abstract = {{In Brazil, the family Gesneriaceae is represented by 23 genera and
   approximately 200 species. Seemannia sylvatica is an herb that occurs in
   dense populations in the riverbeds at Serra da Bodoquena. Goals of this
   study were to report the floral biology (on the first five days of
   anthesis), as well as to determine the breeding system and the
   pollinators of S. sylvatica. Data collection was conducted from June
   2005 to July 2006 through monthly field trips, lasting for five days.
   Data on floral biology, breeding system and on the floral visitors were
   taken from individuals located along a track 2500 m long, in riparian
   forest of Salobrinha river. Flowers of S. sylvatica are tubular, red,
   with no perceptive odor and lasted more than five days (ca. 10 - 20 days
   in individuals transferred to an urban garden and kept in vases).
   Seemania sylvatica is protandrous, and the male phase occurred between
   the first and the fourth days of anthesis, while the female one started
   in the fifth day. Mean nectar volume secreted was 4.77 +/- 3.2 mu l,
   with a significative variation among flowers of different ages.
   Otherwise, nectar concentration average was 9.71 +/- 4.41\%, and did not
   varied significantly in flowers of different ages. The flowers of S.
   sylvatica were pollinated mainly by the hummingbirds Phaethomis pretrei
   and Thalurania furcata, and pierced by the bee Ceratina clitoris. The
   butterfly Parides anchises orbygnianus was considered an occasional
   pollinator of these flowers. Seemannia sylvatica is self-compatible,
   since fruit set occurred on the experiments of spontaneous
   self-pollination, manual self-pollination, cross-pollination and open
   pollination (control). The protandry, coupled with the pattern of nectar
   production, characterized by low volume and solute concentration, which
   induces the pollinators to visit different flowers in a given circuit
   foraging, act maximizing the likelihood of cross-pollination in
   S.,sylvatica. Moreover, the high proportion of fruit set by autogamy is
   an important strategy considering that S. sylvatica is visited by few
   species, being pollinated mainly by P. pretrei. Therefore, in the
   absence of these visitors, the formation of fruits may be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Dormancy is the mechanism that plants use to protect sensitive tissue
   from unfavourable climatic conditions. In a changing global environment,
   temperate fruit crop adaptation might be at risk due to changes in
   temperature cues. A complete picture of dormancy is shown in this
   review, using results from the early, pioneering work to the molecular
   basis, also emphasising dormancy modelling and measurement and their
   implication in temperate fruit production. This description is completed
   by the variability that climatic change might induce in plants through
   direct or indirect changes in dormancy. Future avenues for the correct
   adaptation of temperate fruit crops are proposed that span basic
   questions, from temperate fruit distribution to more-applied questions
   of dormancy, such as application of rest-breaking agents,
   depth-of-dormancy markers, breeding strategies, cross-pollination and
   host-pest interaction. In the context of global climate change, a
   linkage among the cited fields is intended in this review in order to
   raise awareness in the scientific community. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The pollination ecology of the blackberry (Rubus sp.) was studied by
   means of determining its reproductive system, the analysis of flower's
   nectar production. Sampling the insects that visited the blackberry
   flower in a cultivated area and analyzing the pollination behavior. The
   experiments were carried out in an area of blackberry crop, in December
   of 2005 in the city of Timbo (SC), Southern Brazil. The highest fruit
   set (48.3\% +/- 3,2) occurred in the free pollination (natural)
   treatment where insects were not excluded. The occurrence of selfing was
   verified, however with lower fruit set (12.2\% +/- 4,9). Anemophily was
   not observed in the species. The nectar evaluation in Rubus sp. resulted
   in values compatible with the melittophily syndrome. Bees (Hymenoptera)
   were the main floral visitors collected and observed on the flowers of
   Rubus sp., representing 97\% of the individuals. They initiate the
   foraging activity at 8 a.m., with a peak activity at 12 a.m. and
   declining until 4 p.m. En the survey were sampled 1.360 bees, belonging
   to four families and 13 species. Halictidae was the family with highest
   amount of species (N = 7) and Apidae most abundant (1.288 individuals)
   in the survey. Apidae was mainly represented by Apis mellifera, which is
   an exotic species, whose sample was of 1.246 individuals. The data of
   the abundance and the observation of its behavior, pointed A. mellifera

Title = {{Pollen-pistil interactions and early fruiting in parthenocarpic citrus}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{499-509}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims An intense pollen-pistil interaction precedes
   fertilization. This interaction is of particular relevance in
   agronomically important species where seeds or fruits are the edible
   part. Over time some agronomically species have been selected for the
   ability to produce fruit without seeds. While this phenomenon is
   critical for commercial production in some species, very little is known
   about the events behind the production of seedless fruit. In this work,
   the relationship between pollen-pistil interaction and the onset of
   fruiting was investigated in citrus mandarin.
   Methods Pistils were sequentially examined in hand-pollinated flowers
   paying attention to pollen-tube behaviour, and to cytochemical changes
   along the pollen-tube pathway. To evaluate which of these changes were
   induced by pollination/fertilization and which were developmentally
   regulated, pollinated and unpollinated pistils were compared. Also the
   onset of fruiting was timed and changes in the ovary examined.
   Key Results Conspicuous changes occurred in the pistil along the
   pollen-tube pathway, which took place in a basipetal way encompassing
   the timing of pollen-tube growth. However, these changes appear to be
   developmentally regulated as they happened in the same way and at the
   same time in unpollinated flowers. Moreover, the onset of fruiting
   occurred prior to fertilization and the very same changes could be
   observed in unpollinated flowers.
   Conclusions Pollen-pistil interaction in citrus showed similarities with
   unrelated species and families belonging to other taxa. The uncoupling
   of the reproductive and fruiting processes accounts for the
   parthenocarpic ability of unpollinated flowers to produce fruit in
   citrus. However, the maintenance of a functional reproductive process
   reflects the potential to produce seeded fruits, providing a basis for
   the understanding of the production of seeded or unseeded fruits and
   further understanding of the process of parthenocarpy in other species.}},

Abstract = {{Although often considered as evolutionary dead ends, selfing taxa may
   make an important contribution to plant evolution through hybridization
   with related outcrossing lineages. However, there is a shortage of
   studies examining the evolutionary dynamics of hybridization between
   outcrossing and selfing taxa. On the basis of differential pollinator
   attractiveness, production and competitive ability of pollen, as well as
   levels of inbreeding depression, we predict that the early products of
   hybridization between outcrossing and selfing lineages will be F1s and
   first-generation backcrosses sired mainly by the outcrossing lineage,
   together with selfed F2s containing a limited genetic contribution from
   the outcrosser. These predictions were tested using amplified fragment
   length polymorphism and chloroplast markers to analyze the composition
   of a recent hybrid swarm between predominantly outcrossing Geum rivale
   and predominantly selfing Geum urbanum. In line with predictions, the
   hybrid swarm comprised both parental species together with F1s and
   first-generation backcrosses to G. rivale alone. Chloroplast data
   suggested that G. rivale was the pollen parent for both observed hybrid
   classes. However, there was no evidence for F2 individuals, despite the
   fact that the F1 was fully self-compatible and able to auto-pollinate.
   The pollen fertility of F1s was only 30\% lower than that of the
   parental taxa, and was fully restored in backcross hybrids. Predicting
   future evolution in the hybrid swarm will require an understanding of
   the mating patterns within and among the mix of parental, F1 and
   backcross genotypes that are currently present. However, these results
   support the hypothesis that introgression is likely to be asymmetrical
   from selfing to outcrossing lineages. Heredity (2011) 107, 246-255; doi:

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{261-269}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Descriptions of new germplasm published in the Journal of Plant
   Registrations (JPR), and previously in Crop Science, are important
   vehicles for informing researchers about advances in plant breeding.
   Launched in 2007, JPR introduced a format that allowed more detailed
   descriptions of registrations; however, an informal review suggests that
   further improvements are possible. This paper explores these
   suggestions. To support our arguments, we assessed the new format by
   reviewing 234 papers from JPR, focusing on 106 papers (53 each in the
   old-Crop Science-and new-JPR-formats) for cultivar releases in 14
   self-pollinated crops. We examined genealogies (pedigrees), breeding
   processes, experimental techniques, phenotypes, and genotypes. In the
   new format, there was more extensive information on the chronology of
   the breeding process, the expected area of adaptation, experimental
   techniques, the quantification of phenotypes, and citation of web-based
   reports. Nonetheless, improvement appeared possible, including by (i)
   documenting genealogies in databases structured for breeding records;
   (ii) quantifying the degree of relatedness to other germplasm; (iii)
   describing the breeding process in tables that include key dates,
   population types and sizes, and numbers of test environments; (iv)
   describing adaptation through standardized scales, environmental
   classifications, or quantitative responses; (v) providing genotypic
   data; and (vi) providing access to supplementary materials from
   databases or Internet resources.}},

Title = {{Changing Bee and Hoverfly Pollinator Assemblages along an Urban-Rural
   Gradient}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The potential for reduced pollination ecosystem service due
   to global declines of bees and other pollinators is cause for
   considerable concern. Habitat degradation, destruction and fragmentation
   due to agricultural intensification have historically been the main
   causes of this pollinator decline. However, despite increasing and
   accelerating levels of global urbanization, very little research has
   investigated the effects of urbanization on pollinator assemblages. We
   assessed changes in the diversity, abundance and species composition of
   bee and hoverfly pollinator assemblages in urban, suburban, and rural
   sites across a UK city.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Bees and hoverflies were trapped and
   netted at 24 sites of similar habitat character (churchyards and
   cemeteries) that varied in position along a gradient of urbanization.
   Local habitat quality (altitude, shelter from wind, diversity and
   abundance of flowers), and the broader-scale degree of urbanization (e.
   g. percentage of built landscape and gardens within 100 m, 250 m, 500 m,
   1 km, and 2.5 km of the site) were assessed for each study site. The
   diversity and abundance of pollinators were both significantly
   negatively associated with higher levels of urbanization. Assemblage
   composition changed along the urbanization gradient with some species
   positively associated with urban and suburban land-use, but more species
   negatively so. Pollinator assemblages were positively affected by good
   site habitat quality, in particular the availability of flowering
   plants.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that urban areas can support
   diverse pollinator assemblages, but that this capacity is strongly
   affected by local habitat quality. Nonetheless, in both urban and
   suburban areas of the city the assemblages had fewer individuals and
   lower diversity than similar rural habitats. The unique development
   histories of different urban areas, and the difficulty of assessing
   mobile pollinator assemblages in just part of their range, mean that
   complementary studies in different cities and urban habitats are
   required to discover if these findings are more widely applicable.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal and spatial resource use among hummingbirds was studied
   over 13 months in an urban forest remnant (Prosa State Park: PSP) in
   Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Hummingbird visitation was
   recorded at three ornithophilous and eleven non-ornithophilous species.
   Flower density was roughly constant during the study period, with the
   density of non-ornithophilous flowers being higher than that of
   ornithophilous ones. Mean values of nectar volume and concentration were
   similar between ornithophilous and non-ornithophilous species. Eight
   hummingbird species were observed at PSP: Amazilia fimbriata,
   Anthracothorax nigricollis, Chlorostilbon lucidus, Eupetomena macroura,
   Hylocharis chrysura, Florisuga fusca, Thalurania furcata and an
   unidentified species. Hummingbird visit frequencies to ornithophilous
   and non-ornithophilous flowers were similar. However, some
   non-ornithophilous species received a higher number of visits, which
   seems to be related to their large number of open flowers per plant per
   day. The number of feedings bouts of hummingbirds increased with the
   total number of flowers observed per focal plant. All recorded species
   of hummingbirds visited non-ornithophilous flowers, predominantly
   melittophilous and generalised entomophilous flowers. Hummingbird
   species recorded at PSP may be viewed as generalists, visiting a large
   number of non-ornithophilous species. Despite being an urban forest, PSP
   is relatively rich in hummingbird species, suggesting that it provides
   important shelter and foraging sites for hummingbirds in such an
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Byrsonima coccolobifolia is a tropical plant from the Malpighiaceae

   bees known as ``collecting-oil bees{''}. In this study, conducted in a
   Cerrado area located on a farm in the city of Silvania, GO, the
   following hypothesis was tested: the greater the isolation degree of a
   plant, the lower its fruit production due to access difficulties for
   pollinators. Using a linear regression analysis, it was possible to
   relate the fruiting rate with the degree of isolation of each B.
   coccolobifolia individual and consequently it was found that the
   isolation had no influence on the pollination rate, an unexpected event
   that can be explained by the distance amongst individuals not being
   large enough to limit the movement of pollinators, or because
   cross-pollination was not the predominant form of reproduction, since
   the rate of cross-pollination was similar to self-pollination. It was
   also found that the proportion of fruits produced was lower than
   expected, a factor which may also have influenced the results.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study is to analyse the joint effect of biological
   (pollen) and chemical air pollutants, as well as meteorological
   variables, on the hospital admissions of respiratory problems for the
   Szeged region in Southern Hungary. The data set used covers a nine-year
   period (1999-2007) and is unique in the sense that it includes-besides
   the daily number of respiratory hospital admissions-not just the hourly
   mean concentrations of CO, PM10, NO, NO2, O-3 and SO2 with
   meteorological variables (temperature, global solar flux, relative
   humidity, air pressure and wind speed), but two pollen variables
   (Ambrosia and total pollen excluding Ambrosia) as well. The analysis was
   performed using three age categories for the pollen season of Ambrosia
   and the pollen-free season. Meteorological elements and air pollutants
   are clustered in order to define optimum environmental conditions of
   high patient numbers. ANOVA was then used to determine whether
   cluster-related mean patient numbers differ significantly. Furthermore,
   two novel procedures are applied here: factor analysis including a
   special transformation and a time-varying multivariate linear regression
   that makes it possible to determine the rank of importance of the
   influencing variables in respiratory hospital admissions, and also
   compute the relative importance of the parameters affecting respiratory
   disorders. Both techniques revealed that Ambrosia pollen is an important
   variable that influences hospital admissions (an increase of 10 pollen
   grains m(-3) can imply an increase of around 24\% in patient numbers).
   The role of chemical and meteorological parameters is also significant,
   but their weights vary according to the seasons and the methods. Clearer
   results are obtained for the pollination season of Ambrosia. Here, a 10
   mu g m(-3) increase in O-3 implies a patient number response from -17\%
   to +11\%. Wind speed is a surprisingly important variable, where a 1 m
   s(-1) rise may result in a hospital admission reduction of up to
   42-45\%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to widespread polyembryony, Citrus rootstocks are usually propagated
   by open-pollinated seed germination, although micropropagation offers
   many advantages. Encapsulation technology has recently attracted the
   interest of researchers in the field of plant propagation because it
   combines the advantages of zygotic or gamic seeds with those of
   micropropagation. In this study, we examined the encapsulation of
   Carrizo citrange uninodal microcuttings (3-4 mm long) and evaluated the
   influence of the calcium alginate coating, a short time storage at cold
   temperature, and different sowing substrates on the viability and
   regrowth of the explants. A secondary aim was to develop an efficient
   protocol to induce root formation in the microcuttings. The results
   showed that encapsulation did not negatively affect the viability,
   providing a satisfactory regrowth, and storage potential for 30 days at
   low temperature. No differences in viability and regrowth were detected
   between the two different sowing substrates tested (agar-solidified
   medium and paper filter). To optimize the production of microcuttings
   required to perform the encapsulation experiments, in a preliminary
   experiment we assessed different factors affecting the in vitro shoot
   regeneration from epicotyl segments (obtained from seeds of Carrizo
   citrange germinated in vitro), including the influence of in vitro
   organogenesis, explant orientation, cut surface contact with the medium,
   treatments with different growth regulators, and distance of the
   organogenic explants from the cotyledonary node. The highest organogenic
   response was obtained from segments horizontally cultured (particularly
   from the basal portion), from segments with the cut surface in contact
   with the medium and from explants cultured on medium supplemented with
   6-benzyladenine. No significant difference in regeneration efficiency
   was found in response to the distance of the epicotyl portions from the
   cotyledonary node.}},

Abstract = {{Self-incompatibility (SI) in Citrus is known in cultivars and plants of
   pummelo, pummelo relative, and mandarin; however, the detailed mechanism
   of self-incompatibility and the allelic diversity of the SI gene (S) are
   not known because of the presence of barriers such as nucellar embryony,
   male sterility, and a long juvenile phase. Thus, there is little
   information on S genotypes of Citrus cultivars at present. In this
   study, the S genotypes of Citrus cultivars were estimated with the aid
   of allozymes produced by a glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase isozyme
   gene (Got-3), which appeared to link to the S gene. Of twenty-two F-1
   progenies from eleven crosses and their reciprocal crosses with eight
   monoembryonic SI cultivars, including `Banpeiyu' pummelo, three F-1
   progenies from three crosses and three from reciprocal crosses showed
   segregation distortion for the Got-3 gene, suggesting the presence of
   the same S alleles in the cultivars used for the reciprocal crosses.
   Defining the `Banpeiyu' genotype as S1S2, the genotype was estimated as
   S1S3 for `Tosa Buntan', S4S5 for `Hassaku', S6S7 for `Yuge-hyokan', and
   S1S6 for `Shishiyuzu'. Further allozyme analyses for segregation
   distortion in progenies from eight crosses with eight monoembryonic SI
   cultivars suggested the possibility that `Hyuganatsu' has S-1 allele,
   while those from 15 crosses between the eight monoembryonic SI cultivars
   and five polyembryonic self-compatible cultivars suggested the
   possibility that `Rough lemon' has S-1 allele. The estimated genotypes,
   consisting of two of the nine alleles (S-1 to S-8 and S-f) in these
   Citrus cultivars, may be useful for further estimation and determination
   of S genotypes in Citrus cultivars and plants.}},

Abstract = {{The Amazonian Tucuma palm (Astrocaryum aculeatum) produces edible fruit,
   traditionally consumed in indigenous communities and increasingly in
   urban centers. The species is incipiently domesticated and little
   studied, despite its growing economic importance for smallholder farmers
   and gatherers. Studies on the mating system are required for the
   conservation and use of the species' genetic resources. Our objective
   was to estimate mating system parameters of the Tucuma palm using
   microsatellite markers. Plants of 11 progenies of a spontaneous
   population were genotyped with eight microsatellite loci and the mating
   system parameters estimated. The population outcrossing rate was
   estimated at 0.978, and ranged from 0.774 to 1at the family level. The
   estimates of the correlation of paternity (0.176 and 0.205) suggest a
   low probability of full-sibs within progenies. Tucuma palm is a
   predominantly allogamous species and the open-pollinated progenies
   consist predominantly of half-sibs.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns about pollinator declines have grown in recent years, yet the
   ability to detect changes in abundance, taxonomic richness, and
   composition of pollinator communities is hampered severely by the lack
   of data over space and time. Citizen scientists may be able to extend
   the spatial and temporal extent of pollinator monitoring programs. We
   developed a citizen-science monitoring protocol in which we trained 13
   citizen scientists to observe and classify floral visitors at the
   resolution of orders or super families (e. g., bee, wasp, fly) and at
   finer resolution within bees (superfamily Apoidea) only. We evaluated
   the protocol by comparing data collected simultaneously at 17 sites by
   citizen scientists (observational data set) and by professionals
   (specimen-based data set). The sites differed with respect to the
   presence and age of hedgerows planted to improve habitat quality for
   pollinators. We found significant, positive correlations among the two
   data sets for higher level taxonomic composition, honey bee (Apis
   mellifera) abundance, non-Apis bee abundance, bee richness, and bee
   community similarity. Results for both data sets also showed similar
   trends (or lack thereof) in these metrics among sites differing in the
   presence and age of hedgerows. Nevertheless, citizen scientists did not
   observe approximately half of the bee groups collected by professional
   scientists at the same sites. Thus, the utility of citizen-science
   observational data may be restricted to detection of community-level
   changes in abundance, richness, or similarity over space and time, and
   citizen-science observations may not reliably reflect the abundance or
   frequency of occurrence of specific pollinator species or groups.}},

Abstract = {{The diseases huanglongbing {[}HLB, associated with Candidatus
   Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas)] and Asian citrus canker {[}ACC, caused by
   Xantlzomonas citri (Xcc)] are widespread in Florida and many other
   citrus-growing areas, presenting unprecedented challenges for citrus
   breeding. Because RIB and ACC weaken trees and compromise cropping,
   breeding is much less efficient using seed parents that have been
   exposed to these diseases. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to
   use unique disease-exposed selections only as pollen parents with pollen
   applied to disease-free trees. However, there may be a risk of
   introducing these diseases using such pollen sources. To assess this
   potential, abundance of the pathogens associated with these diseases was
   assessed in anthers and flowers using quantitative polymerase chain
   reaction. Because CLas is systemic, levels on mature leaves from the
   flower source trees were assessed to see if the presence of CLas in
   flowers was associated with leaf levels. Disease-exposed trees were
   tested in 10 genotypes from each of three broad genotypic categories,
   which reflect different levels of susceptibility to the diseases
   associated with the pathogens studied: Ponciras trifoliata hybrids (most
   resistant to HLB), Citrus maxima and hybrids (susceptible to both
   diseases), and C. reticulata and hybrids (considerable resistance to
   ACC). Of the 30 samples of each tissue type analyzed for CLas, 88\% of
   mature leaves, 69\% of flowers, and 88\% of anthers had one or more CLas
   bacterium per sample. The trifoliate genotypic group had significantly
   lower levels of CLas than the pummelo and mandarin groups in mature leaf
   samples, but CLas levels were more similar between groups in anther and
   flower samples, and the pathogen was present in most of the trifoliate
   hybrids tested. Mean numbers of CLas detected per nanogram nucleic acid
   were 100 to 800 times higher in mature leaf samples, most characteristic
   of HLB symptoms, compared with anther samples. Xcc DNA was detected in
   30\% of flower samples and 23\% of anther samples. No significant
   differences in Xcc levels were found between tissue type or genotypic
   group. However, regressions between Xcc levels in flowers and percent of
   plant pedigree derived from mandarin had a negative correlation and an
   r(2) of 0.159 (P= 0.029). The biology of CLas is consistent with the
   pathogen being present in anthers from unopened flowers, whereas the ACC
   pathogen detected inside flowers was likely the result of contamination
   despite great care in sample collection and handling. Where exceptional
   diligence to exclude HLB and ACC is appropriate, results suggest that
   there may be a risk of spreading these pathogens through use of pollen
   from trees on infected farms.}},

Abstract = {{Comolia ovalifolia DC Triana (Melastomataceae) and Chamaecrista ramosa
   (Vog.) H. S. Irwin and Barneby var. ramosa (Leguminosae -
   Caesalpinioideae) are tropical plant species found in restinga
   (herbaceous-shrubby, sandy costal ecosystems). They have flowers with
   poricidal anthers and are pollinated by bees. The study sought to
   analyse potential pollinators of both plants during visits to their
   flowers in a restinga area in Bahia. The flowering displayed by both
   species was considered continuous and long duration, constantly
   providing pollen to floral visitors. C. ovalifolia was visited by 17
   species of bees and C. ramosa by 16 species, predominantly from the
   Apidae family (with a similarity index of 74\%). The behavior displayed
   by these visiting bees was of vibrating anthers. The small-sized
   Euglossa sp. Latreille, 1802 and Florilegus similis Urban, 1970 bees
   played less of a role as pollinators, since they rarely touched the
   flower stigma during harvests and were thus considered opportunist
   visitors or casual pollinators. Centris decolorata Lepetier, 1841 (= C.
   leprieuri) and Xylocopa subcyanea Perez, 1901 are large bees and were
   considered efficient pollinators of C. ovalifolia and C. ramosa because
   of the higher frequency and constancy of their visits, and their
   favourable behaviour and size for pollen transfer between flowers, which
   guarantees the survival of these native restinga plant species.}},

Abstract = {{1. Despite increasing interest in gardening for wildlife, experiments
   testing the conservation value of garden alterations are scarce,
   particularly in heavily urbanised landscapes.
   2. In this paper, we assess the ability of discrete additions of native
   wildflowers (70 plants of seven plant species added and subsequently
   monitored for 2 years) to augment species richness of beneficial insects
   including bees, butterflies and predatory wasps in New York City
   community gardens. We also evaluate the overall use of native and
   introduced flowers by these insect groups in the urban garden study
   sites.
   3. Bayesian analyses failed to find a strong influence of the native
   plant additions on beneficial insect richness, after correcting for
   prior floral abundance.
   4. In addition, butterflies and megachilid (leaf-cutter) bees were found
   to heavily utilise introduced ornamental and crop flowers in these
   gardens, even when native flowers were present.
   5. Our results suggest that exotic garden plants are utilised by, and
   important in maintaining richness of, beneficial insects in urbanised
   landscapes. Furthermore, garden manipulations need to be more
   substantial than often recommended, if they are to significantly
   influence the richness of beneficial insects in urban gardens.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Since 1981, 365 papers have cited a rarity matrix organized along three
   axes: geographic range (GR) (large vs. small), habitat specificity (HS)
   (specialist vs. generalist), and local abundance (LA) (dense vs.
   sparse). In the wider ecology literature, research on the association
   between plant species distributions and life history traits has mainly
   focused on a single axis such as GR. However, the internal structure of
   species ranges is widely recognized as important. In order to determine
   if identifying different types of rarity leads to alternative
   conclusions regarding the causes and consequences of rarity, we created
   a dataset linking the seven types of rarity matrix and to reproductive
   ecology traits. We found associations between the axes and these traits
   in a dataset of 101 rare plant species culled from 27 papers.
   Significant traits included mating system and seed dispersal mechanism.
   Species with small GR are more likely to have ballistic or wind
   dispersal than biotically-mediated dispersal (abiotic:biotic ratio 3:1).
   Habitat specialist species with small GRs are more likely to have
   outcrossing mating systems compared to habitat specialists of large GR
   (16:1). These results show that, within rare species, the structure of
   rarity is important (e.g. habitat specialization is different from small
   GR) and should be identified when determining basic mechanisms of plant
   distribution and abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Seedlings from seven open-pollinated selections of Chinese wingnut
   (Pterocarya stenoptera) (WN) representing collections of the USDA-ARS
   National Clonal Germplasm Repository at Davis, CA, and the University of
   California at Davis were evaluated as rootstocks for resistance to
   Phytophthora cinnamomi and P. citricola and graft compatibility with
   scions of five cultivars of Persian walnut (Juglans regia). Seedlings of
   Northern California black walnut (NCB) (J. hindsii) and Paradox hybrid
   (PH) (typically J. hindsii x J. regia) were used as standards. In
   greenhouse experiments, potted plants of the rootstocks were subjected
   to intermittent flooding in soil artificially infested with the
   pathogens. All WN seedlings were relatively resistant to the pathogens
   (means of 0\% to 36\% of root and crown length rotted) compared with NCB
   (44\% to 100\%) and PH seedlings (11\% to 100\%). Negligible disease
   occurred in flooded control soil without the pathogens. In 9-year graft
   compatibility trials in an orchard, NCB and PH rootstocks supported
   relatively good survival and growth of all tested scion cultivars
   ('Chandler, `Hartley', `Serr', `Tulare', and `Vina'; final scion
   survival 80\% to 100\%, mean scion circumference increase 292 to 541
   mm), whereas: results with WN were mixed. Wingnut rootstocks from all
   sources were incompatible with `Chandler' (final scion survival 20\% to
   60\%, scion circumference increase 17 to 168 mat). Conversely, all WN
   rootstocks from all sources were compatible with `Tulare' and `Vina'
   (final scion survival 80\% to 100\%, scion circumference increase 274 to
   556 mm). Use of the WN rootstocks produced variable results in `Hartley'
   and `Serr' (final scion survival 10\% to 100\%, mean scion circumference
   increase 69 to 542 mm). There was a tendency for more rootstock sprouts
   on WN selections than on NCB or PH. In a commercial walnut orchard
   infested with P. cinnamomi, `Hartley' survived and grew markedly better
   on WN selections than on PH. High resistance to P. cinnamomi and P.
   citricola was common to all of the WN selections. The results indicate
   that WN selections may be useful rootstocks for cultivars Tulare and
   Vina in soils infested with P. cinnamomi or P. citricola and that WN
   selections may contribute valuable resistance to these pathogens in
   walnut rootstock breeding efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Biodiversity assessment is the first step in
   protecting the complete range of morphological and genetic diversity of
   species on Earth, and in reaching the goals of conservation biology.
   Assessment begins with identifying organisms that make up biological
   communities and understanding evolutionary histories. Scientific
   advancements in molecular sequencing can help clarify and provide
   support for identifications. Massively parallel DNA sequencing
   technologies are being used to sequence complete genomes of model
   organisms; however, this resource has not been fully used for species
   identifications. Animal researchers commonly use one mitochondrial
   region, and groups of plant scientists have proposed numerous
   combinations of two or three chloroplast markers as genomic identifiers.
   Yet, nearly as many studies have reported that the proposed regions are
   uninformative in some plant groups and at various taxonomic levels.
   Methods: We propose a combination of whole (or nearly whole) chloroplast
   genomes, mitochondrial genes, and nuclear repeat regions for both
   species identifications and phylogenetic analyses, obtained from a
   simple total DNA extraction and one run on massively parallel DNA
   sequencing machines.
   Key results: We have recovered both coding and noncoding sequences from
   multiple genetic sources, providing genomic information for comparisons
   within and between multiple taxonomic levels.
   Conclusions: In combination with morphological and other data, this
   abundance of genomic information will have a broad range of
   applications, including not only helping conservation biologists
   understand ecosystem biodiversity, but also understanding the
   evolutionary histories of organisms, mending damaged landscapes, and
   investigating interactions of plants with pollinators and pests.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread reports of low pollination rates suggest a recent
   anthropogenic decline in pollination that could threaten natural and
   agricultural ecosystems. Nevertheless, unequivocal evidence for a
   decline in pollination over time has remained elusive because it was not
   possible to determine historical pollination rates. Here we demonstrate
   a widely applicable method for reconstructing historical pollination
   rates, thus allowing comparison with contemporary rates from the same
   sites. We focused on the relationship between the oil-collecting bee
   Rediviva peringueyi (Melittidae) and the guild of oil-secreting orchid
   species (Coryciinae) that depends on it for pollination. The guild is
   distributed across the highly transformed and fragmented lowlands of the
   Cape Region of South Africa. We show that rehydrated herbarium specimens
   of Pterygodium catholicum, the most abundant member of the guild,
   contain a record of past pollinator activity in the form of pollinarium
   removal rates. Analysis of a pollination time series showed a recent
   decline in pollination on Signal Hill, a small urban conservation area.
   The same herbaria contain historical species occurrence data. We
   analyzed this data and found that there has been a contemporaneous shift
   in orchid guild composition in urban areas due to the local extirpation
   of the non-clonal species, consistent with their greater dependence on
   seeds and pollination for population persistence.}},

Abstract = {{In flowering plants, pollen dispersal is often the major contributing
   component to gene flow, hence a key parameter in conservation genetics
   and population biology. A cost-effective method to assess pollen
   dispersal consists of monitoring the dispersal of fluorescent dyes used
   as pollen analogues. However, few comparisons between dye dispersal and
   realized pollen dispersal have been performed to validate the method. We
   investigated pollen dispersal in two small populations of the
   insect-pollinated herb Primula elatior from urban forest fragments using
   direct (paternity analyses based on microsatellite DNA markers) and
   indirect (fluorescent dyes) methods. We compared these methods using two
   approaches, testing for the difference between the distance
   distributions of observed dispersal events and estimating parameters of
   a dispersal model, and related these results to dye dispersal patterns
   in three large populations. Dye and realized (based on paternity
   inference) pollen dispersal showed exponential decay distributions, with
   74.2-94.8\% of the depositions occurring at < 50 m and a few longer
   distance dispersal events (up to 151 m). No significant difference in
   curve shape was found between dye and realized pollen dispersal
   distributions. The best-fitting parameters characterizing the dye
   dispersal model were consistent with those obtained for realized pollen
   dispersal. Hence, the fluorescent dye method may be considered as
   reliable to infer realized pollen dispersal for forest herbs such as P.
   elatior. However, our simulations reveal that large sample sizes are
   needed to detect moderate differences between dye and realized pollen
   dispersal patterns because the estimation of dispersal parameters
   suffers low precision.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It is clear that the majority of flowering plants are pollinated by
   insects and other animals, with a minority utilising abiotic pollen
   vectors, mainly wind. However there is no accurate published calculation
   of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact
   with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67\% to 96\% but these
   have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion
   of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and
   unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that
   recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind.
   The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78\% in
   temperate-zone communities to 94\% in tropical communities. By
   correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we
   estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated
   angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5\% of the estimated species-level
   diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline
   in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural
   communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both
   ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in
   detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and
   how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt
   that plant-pollinator interactions play a significant role in
   maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{S-RNase-based self-incompatibility is the most widespread form of
   genetically controlled mate selection in plants and that S-RNase
   controls pollination specificity in the pistils. `Wuzishatangju' (Citrus
   reticulata Blanco), a nature bud mutant from a self-compatible (SC)
   cultivar `Shatangju', displays gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI).
   In this study, full-length sequences of cDNA and DNA of the S-RNase
   homologous gene were obtained from `Wuzishatangju' and `Shatangju'.
   There was no difference in ORF sequences of the S-RNase cDNA between
   `Wuzishatangju' and `Shatangju'. However, 13, 9 and 6 consecutive bases
   were missing in `Wuzishatangju' cDNA 5' UTR, 3' UTR and genomic DNA,
   respectively. Tissue-specific expression of the S-RNase gene was
   detected using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR.
   The expression level of the S-RNase gene in styles of `Wuzishatangju'
   was approximately 10- and 5-fold higher than that in leaves and pollen,
   respectively. When `Wuzishatangju' was self-pollinated, the expression
   of S-RNase in pistils peaked at 3 days, which was approximately 10-fold
   higher than that at 4 h and 7 days, while in cross-pollination of
   `Wuzishatangju' x `Shatangju' the expression was very weak at 3 days.
   Results from a Southern blot showed that two copies of the S-RNase gene
   existed in genomic DNA of both `Wuzishatangju' and `Shatangju'. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Bignoniaceous woody species are very important ecological components of
   neotropical forests, but the reproductive biology of many species, such
   as Cybistax antisyphilitica, remains virtually unknown. Most species of
   Bignoniaceae are characteristically self-sterile, despite typically
   exhibiting normal pollen tube growth throughout the style, combined with
   slow rates of ovule penetration, fertilisation and endosperm initiation
   in selfed pistils. Uniform abortion occurs within a few days of
   anthesis, indicating the occurrence of late-acting self-incompatibility
   (LSI). However, breeding system studies have been performed in fewer
   than 7\% of species, and other types of breeding systems (e.g.,
   self-compatibility and apomixis) have been reported in this family. In
   the present study, the reproductive biology of C. antisyphilitica was
   investigated by field observation of flower visitors and floral events.
   Moreover, reproductive biology of this species was examined through
   experimental pollinations, analyses of pollen tube growth and ovule
   penetration using fluorescence microscopy, verification of pistil
   longevity, and a histological analysis of unpollinated vs.
   self-pollinated pistils. Finally, morphological aspects, quantities and
   germination were investigated in seeds that resulted from different
   pollination treatments. Natural pollination was effected by large-and
   medium-sized bees, and their visiting behaviour favours a high
   proportion of geitonogamy and no pollen limitation. Self-pollinated
   flowers produced no fruits, and all of the characteristic
   post-pollination events cited above were verified, witnessing the
   occurrence of LSI with post-zygotic rejection of selfed pistils in C.
   antisyphilitica. Although some indications of extended pistil longevity
   were found in selfed pistils, this feature seemed to be affected by
   unidentified environmental factors. The seeds were always monoembryonic
   and with high viability. A larger variation in the number of viable
   seeds was found in fruits derived from natural pollination. A low fruit
   set was observed after both natural and cross-pollination, and most
   crossed fruits underwent abortion at several points during the juvenile
   phase, even when protected against herbivory. The formation of surplus
   flowers/juvenile fruits and the apparently wasteful selfing mechanism
   control implied in LSI are discussed in the context of the perennial
   life style of tropical woody plant species. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{Urban ecosystems pose different environmental constraints on plant and
   animal communities than natural ecosystems, and this in turn might
   affect ecological interactions. We investigated plant pollinator
   interactions in urban vegetation communities in the context of local
   community structure and two landscape metrics describing the surrounding
   urban matrix. We recorded plant species diversity, floral density,
   pollinator species and floral visits at 89 flowering patches within the
   urban matrix, and used Trifolium pratense as a focal plant species.
   We correlated visits by all species, by bees, by bees when excluding the
   main visitor Bombus pascuorum, and by the main visitor alone T. pratense
   with the landscape metrics ``green area{''}, representing the total
   extent of vegetated areas, and ``edge density of green areas{''},
   representing the degree of habitat fragmentation, at scales from 20 to
   200 m. Extent of green area was positively correlated with visits by all
   species, by bees, and by Bombus pascuorum, but negatively with bees
   excluding the main visitor. The correlation increased with scale for all
   four variables, and the strongest correlations were found for B.
   pascuorum. The direction of correlation between edge density and the
   visitation variables was similar as for green area, but showed
   considerable variation at scales below 100 m radius.
   Visits by all bees and all visitors to T. pratense were negatively
   affected by flowering plant species diversity. There was a positive
   interaction between extent of green area and plant diversity on bee
   visitation, and a negative interaction between the extent of green area
   and heterospecific flowers for bees (excluding B. pascuorum). Increasing
   floral abundance and plant diversity reduced pollinator visitation to T.
   pro tense, suggesting competitive effects through both quantity and
   diversity of resources. Competition for flower visitors was mainly from
   Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens, both of which frequently
   co-occurred with T. pratense.
   We conclude that T. pratense competes for pollinators with other
   co-occurring plants, but that the nature of the surrounding urban matrix
   mediates interactions among plant species for pollinator services at
   different scales, particularly with respect to the proportion of green
   areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The tree Cybistax antisyphilitica (ipe-verde) is widespread in the
   cerrado of the Brazilian Central Plateau, showing green flowers and
   dehiscent fruits with wind dispersed seeds. We studied the phenology of
   leaf fall, leaf flushing, flowering and fruiting in the urban area of
   Jatai city, Goias state. Seventeen trees were observed twice a month
   from May/2006 to January/2009. The trees showed high synchrony within
   each phenophases, and annual seasonal pattern. Leaf fall occurred in the
   dry season, followed by leaf flushing in late dry season. Flowering was
   concentrated in early wet season, soon after the vegetative events.
   Fruit dehiscence and dispersal of anemochoric seeds occurred at the end
   of dry season. Usually, events showed negative significant correlations
   with all environmental variables, both in the current month and up to
   two months prior to the event occurrence. This suggests a gradual
   increase in the leaf production, flowers and fruits associated with the
   decrease in rainfall, humidity and temperature. However, phylogenetic
   relationships and pollinators and dispersers interactions may also
   regulate the phenology of C. antisyphilitica.}},

Title = {{RELATIVE RESPONSE OF FORAGE AND SEED YIELD OF ALFALFA TO SULFUR,

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{888-908}},
Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted from 2000 to 2007 on three-year old
   alfalfa stand near Star City in northeastern Saskatchewan to determine
   the influence of balanced application of sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), or
   potassium (K) fertilizers on forage dry matter yield (DMY) and seed
   yield, protein concentration (PC) in forage, concentration and uptake of
   total nitrogen (N), P, K, S, and boron (B) in forage and seed, and
   residual soil extractable P, exchangeable K and sulfate-S. Appropriate
   application of S, P, or K fertilizer nutrients was required to obtain
   optimum yield, PC, and nutrient concentration and uptake, especially
   when alfalfa was grown for hay production. Yield response to
   fertilization was much more frequent and much higher when alfalfa was
   managed as hay compared to when managed for seed production. The results
   suggest the importance of proper fertilization in increasing longevity
   of alfalfa stands. Under both hay and seed plots, there was only a small
   increase in residual sulfate-S from S fertilization, but significant
   accumulation of extractable P mainly in the 0-15 soil layer from P
   application. There was relatively higher concentration of exchangeable K
   in soil in the seed plots than in hay plots. In hay plots,
   concentrations of residual exchangeable K in soil were negatively
   related to DMY, especially in 2007. The findings suggest that when a
   soil is testing low (or deficient) in a nutrient and alfalfa growth is
   reduced, then alfalfa producers should consider applying fertilizers to
   supply adequate amounts of nutrients that are lacking in the soil,
   especially for optimum forage production. However, it is still difficult
   to predict accurately if a profitable alfalfa seed yield response to
   fertilization would occur, particularly when soils are testing marginal
   in some nutrient levels and yields are negatively affected by abnormal
   weather conditions (drought soil moisture conditions reducing plant
   growth, wet, cloudy and cool weather conditions decreasing pollination
   activity and late summer and/or early autumn frost damage to seed
   formation) that often occur in the growing season in this region.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated female and male gamete formation in a pummelo {[}Citrus
   maxima (Burm.) Merr.] haploid. During female gamete formation, no
   embryo-sac mother cell (EMC) was formed in ovules, and consequently no
   normal embryo sac was observed at anthesis, which was confirmed as the
   cause of female sterility in the haploid. During male gamete formation,
   on the other hand, meiosis in the pollen mother cells (PMCs) of the
   haploid occurred twice, but abnormalities were observed in most dividing
   cells. In some dividing cells, univalents did not distribute to the
   opposite poles at anaphase I; instead, they remained near the equatorial
   plate. The nine univalents then performed mitosis, which distributed
   equally forward opposite poles. Furthermore, at the tetrad stage, the
   tetrad comprised 99.3\% of the `Banpeiyu' pummelo, whereas sporads from
   monads to hexads with a relatively high frequency of dyads (24.7\%) were
   produced in the haploid. These results suggest that fertile pollen
   grains observed in the haploid pummelo were produced by abnormalities in
   the first meiotic division such as first division restitution (FDR).}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this research was to describe the biological interaction
   between Salvia bogotensis (Lamiaceae) and the flower flies (Diptera:
   Syrphidae) in an urban setting, the Jardin Botanico ``Jose Celestino
   Mutis{''} (Bogota DC). After verifying the existence of the entomophily
   syndrome, the following aspects were studied: floral morphology,
   taxonomic composition, richness and abundance of syrphid species
   identified as flower visitors, and their cephalic and oral morphometry.
   S. bogotensis presents entomophily syndrome with absence of selfing. The
   Syrphid community associated with S. bogotensis included the following
   nine species in five genera: Allograpta neotropica Curran, 1936,
   Allograpta exotica Wiedermann, 1830, Allograpta annulipes Macquart,
   1850, Allograpta aenea Hull, 1937, Lejops mexicana Macquart, 1842,
   Platycheirus ecuadoriensis Fluke, 1945, Platycheirus fenestrata
   Macquart, 1842, Syrphus shoree Fluke, 1950 and Toxomerus sp. 1. The
   species of flower flies (Syrphidae), as a whole, showed behavioral and
   morphological characteristics associated with low-efficiency
   pollinators, with a low rate of visits, inability for activation of
   levers staminal and minimal contact insect body with the anthers and
   stigma of the flower. Additionally, the flies showed a very low load of
   pollen grains of S. bogotensis in the body, and with high investment of
   time in cleaning its body (grooming). Flowers visited by these flies did
   not result in fruit. These results suggest that flower flies do not
   effectively participate in the pollination of S. bogotensis. Other
   insect visitors that might be responsible for the pollination of S.
   bogotensis were species of the families Apidae, Halictidae, and
   Megachilidae. Flower flies feed on the pollen of S. bogotensis but do
   not interfere with growth and plant development, indicating a
   commensalistic relationship with S. bogotensis.}},

Abstract = {{Seedlessness is one of the main goals in Citrus breeding programs,
   because seedness is not accepted by the fresh fruit market. Triploids in
   Citrus are taken into consideration by breeders since their fruits are
   seedless. Several breeding strategies, based on conventional and
   innovative methods, were developed for the triploid production.
   Occasional triploid (2n=3x=27) offspring had been selected from
   conventional diploid crosses 2xx2x. Several researchers (Esen and Soost,
   1971, 1973; Geraci et al., 1975) showed that triploid progenies are more
   likely to be found in small seeds of monoembryonic cultivars.
   `Hernandina' is a spontaneous mutation of `Fina' clementine (Citrus
   clementina Hort. ex Tan.) with seedy fruits when cultivated in presence
   of compatible genotypes.
   In this study, small and normal open-pollinated seeds of `Hernandina'
   were germinated in vitro and seedling ploidy was determined by flow
   cytometry analyses. Out of 65 samples analysed obtained from small seed
   germination, 4.6\% resulted triploids. Triploid plants have been

Abstract = {{Phenological studies in combination with aerobiological studies enable
   one to observe the relationship between the release of pollen and its
   presence in the atmosphere. To obtain a suitable comparison between the
   daily variation of airborne pollen concentrations and flowering, it is
   necessary for the level of accuracy of both sets of data to be as
   similar as possible. To analyse the correlation between locally observed
   flowering data and pollen counts in pollen traps in order to set pollen
   information forecasts, pollen was sampled using a Burkard volumetric
   pollen trap working continuously from May 1993. For the phenological
   study we selected the main pollen sources of the six pollen types most
   abundant in our area: Cupressaceae, Platanus, Quercus, Plantago, Olea,
   and Poaceae with a total of 35 species. We selected seven sites to
   register flowering or pollination, two with semi-natural vegetation, the
   rest being urban sites. The sites were visited weekly from March to June
   in 2007, and from January to June in 2008 and 2009. Pollen shedding was
   checked at each visit, and recorded as the percentage of flowers or
   microsporangia in that state. There was an association between flowering
   phenology and airborne pollen records for some of the pollen types
   (Platanus, Quercus, Olea and Plantago). Nevertheless, for the other
   types (Cupressaceae and Poaceae) the flowering and airborne pollen peaks
   did not coincide, with up to 1 week difference in phase. Some arguments
   are put forward in explanation of this phenomenon. Phenological studies
   have shown that airborne pollen results from both local and distant
   sources, although the pollen peaks usually appear when local sources are
   shedding the greatest amounts of pollen. Resuspension phenomena are
   probably more important than long-distance transport in explaining the
   presence of airborne pollen outside the flowering period. This
   information could be used to improve pollen forecasts.}},

Abstract = {{The primary factor limiting the use of size-controlling rootstocks in
   California peach and nectarine production is the lack of suitable,
   commercially available size-controlling rootstocks with a wide range of
   compatibility with scion cultivars. In 1986, Prunus genotypes with
   widely varying genetic backgrounds were evaluated for their rooting
   capacity, compatibility with `O'Henry' peach and size-controlling
   characteristics. Subsequently a semi-commercial rootstock trial was
   initiated at the Kearney Agricultural Center (Parlier, CA) to evaluate
   the commercial potential of eight rootstocks identified in the previous
   trial. The main part of this experiment involved ten different
   rootstocks and two scions. The ten rootstocks were: Alace, Hiawatha,
   Sapalta (open pollinated seedlings of a Prunus besseyi x P. salicina
   hybrid), K-145-5, K-146-43, K-146-44, P-30-135 (P. salicina x P. persica
   hybrids), K-119-50 (P salicina x P. dulcis hybrid), and two commercially
   available rootstocks, Citation and Nemaguard. The two main scion
   cultivars were `Loadel' (an early clingstone processing cultivar) and
   `Flavorcrest' (an early fresh market freestone cultivar). This trial
   documented that three rootstocks provided a range of size-controlling
   (compared to trees grown of the vigorous commercial standard,
   Nemaguard), were compatible with a broad array of scion cultivars and
   appeared to have commercial potential for California. As a result of
   this and other research, in 2004 K146-43 and P30-135 were patented and
   commercially released as Controller 5 and Controller 9, respectively. We
   also began recommending commercial trials of these two rootstocks along
   with Hiawatha because they provided a range of size-controlling options
   (similar to 50, 70 and 90\% of trees on Nemaguard for Controller 5,
   Hiawatha and Controller 9, respectively). This paper reports on relative
   tree growth, crop yield and pruning requirements of trees on these three
   rootstocks compared to the industry standard (Nemaguard) over twelve
   years.}},

Abstract = {{`Shatian' pummelo (Citrus grandis Osbeck), one of the main citrus
   cultivars in China, is self-incompatible, and its pollen tubes are
   believed to be arrested in style after self-pollination.We have
   characterized one `Shatian' pummelo mutant, named `Zigui shatian'
   pummelo. The mutant pummelo had identical DNA ploidy level, morphology
   (leaf shape, stoma size and density, pollen shape and size) and
   developmental progress of pistil and male organs to that of the common
   `Shatian' pummelo. However, unlike the common `Shatian' pummelo, `Zigui
   shatian' is self-compatible since its pollen tubes can self-pollinate
   allowing for successful fertilization. Histological analyses of
   `Shatian' pummelo further verified abnormal post-zygotic development
   which led to seed abortion. Simple sequence repeats (SSR) analysis
   revealed polymorphism in 1 of the 120 primers screened showing that
   `Zigui shatian' and `Shatian' pummelo are different at the DNA level.
   Taken together, these data suggested mutant `Zigui shatian' pummelo
   might be derived from `Shatian' pummelo with self-sterility by
   self-incongruity after self-fertilization.}},

Abstract = {{Poor fructification is one of the biggest problems with the production
   of pears in Brazil. The absence of fertilization in pear flowers results
   in lower fruit set and reduction in orchard productivity. When
   pollination is insufficient, it is necessary to use bioregulators. The
   objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different
   plant growth regulators in increasing productivity of `Packham's
   Triumph' pears. The experiment was conducted in Sao Joaquim city (28
   degrees 17'S; 49 56'W, altitude 1350 m), Santa Catarina State, Brazil.
   The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design. The
   treatments were: 1 - Promalin (R) (1 ml L-1) at full bloom; 2 - Promalin
   (R) (0.3 ml L-1) applied at the beginning, full and end of bloom; 3 -
   Prohexadione-Ca (0.65 g L-1) at full bloom; 4 - Prohexadione-Ca (1.25 g
   L-1) at full bloom; 5 - Prohexadione-Ca (2.5 g L-1); 6 - ReTain (R) (2 g
   L-1) 15 days after full bloom (DAFB); 7 -Promalin (R) (1 ml L-1) at full
   bloom+ReTain (R) (2 g L-1) 15 DAFB; 8 -Promalin (R) (1 ml L-1)+ReTain
   (R) (2 g L-1) at full bloom; 9 -Promalin (R) (1 ml L-1)+Prohexadione-Ca
   (0.65 g L-1) at full bloom; 10 - Control (water). Productivity (ton
   ha(-1)), fruit diameter, weight, deformation, seed number, flesh
   firmness, total soluble solids, acidity and pH were evaluated. Treatment
   7 did not differ from 8 in fruit productivity and diameter and both were
   better than the others. The control presented the highest number of
   seeds and treatment 8 the highest rate of fruit deformation. The other
   variables did not differ among treatments.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of pear-compatible rootstocks in Brazil calls for the
   application of classical genetic techniques. Therefore, in order to
   obtain select suitable material, the search for genetic segregation must
   be continuous, being used as alternative scion cultivars. This study
   aims to assess fruit set, number of seeds, fruit weight and fruit
   diameter according to crosses between pear cultivars. The trial was
   carried out from September 2008 to February 2009 in a commercial orchard
   in the city of Vacaria/RS, Brazil. For the pollination process, pollen
   was extracted from flowers at full-white stage in the same orchard. The
   cultivars used were `Packham's Triumph' and `Clapps Favorite'. The
   crossings were defined as: open pollination; self-pollination of
   `Packham's Triumph' and `Packham's Triumph' x `Clapps Favorite'. The
   pollinations were done manually in flowers at full-white stage, which
   were opened, emasculated and then pollinated. Each pollinated flower was
   then isolated with a fine nylon bag. Open pollination and cross
   pollination between `Packham's Triumph' x `Clapps Favorite' provided
   higher fruit set (17 and 18\%, respectively). Fruit weight and diameter
   did not differ between treatments. Open pollination provided fruits with
   a higher number of seeds.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Pollination patterns determine the reproductive
   neighborhood size of plants, the connectivity of populations, and the
   impacts of habitat fragmentation. We characterized pollination in three
   populations of Quercus macrocarpa occurring in a highly altered
   landscape in northeastern Illinois to determine whether isolated remnant
   stands were reproductively isolated.
   Methods: We used microsatellites to genotype all adults and 787 acorns
   from two isolated savanna remnants and a stand in an old-growth forest.
   One isolated remnant occurred in a highly urbanized/industrialized
   landscape, and one occurred in an agricultural landscape. Parentage
   assignment was used to assess pollen-mediated gene flow.
   Key results: Pollen donors from outside the study sites accounted for
   between 46\% and 53\% of paternities and did not differ significantly
   among sites, indicating that similar high levels of gene flow occurred
   at all three sites. Within stands, the mean pollination distance ranged
   from 42 to 70 meters, and when accounting for outside pollinations, mean
   pollination distances were well over 100 meters. Genetic diversity of
   incoming pollen was extremely high in all three stands. The number of
   effective pollen donors, N-ep, calculated from paternity assignment was
   higher than that estimated by an indirect correlated paternity approach.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that extremely isolated stands of
   oaks are unlikely to be genetically and reproductively isolated, and
   remnant stands may contribute to maintaining genetic connectivity in
   highly modified landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Geum urbanum and Geum rivale are two widely hybridizing perennial herbs.
   Estimation of the breeding systems of these taxa using nuclear
   microsatellite markers scored in mother-progeny arrays demonstrated
   that, in pure populations, G. urbanum is predominantly selfing
   (outcrossing rate, t = 0.058 to 0.177), whereas G. rivale is
   predominantly outcrossing (t = 0.686-0.775). Theory suggests that
   hybridization between inbreeding and outcrossing species can potentially
   generate novel inbreeding lineages. However, the establishment of such
   lineages may be restricted either by self-incompatibility loci or
   deleterious recessive alleles derived from the outcrossing parent. To
   assess the likelihood that hybridization between G. urbanum and G.
   rivale will generate novel inbreeding lineages, self-incompatibility and
   inbreeding depression were investigated in the two taxa. Seed set in the
   absence of pollinators, and after controlled self- and
   cross-pollination, was measured to study self-incompatibility.
   Inbreeding depression was measured by estimating the relative fitness of
   offspring from controlled self-and cross-pollinations. Geum urbanum was
   fully self-compatible {[}self-compatibility index (SCI) = 1] and bagged
   flowers showed full seed set. By contrast, only 3\% of bagged flowers
   set seed in G. rivale and controlled self-pollinations showed a 60-80\%
   reduction in seed set compared to controlled outcross pollinations (SCI
   = 0.28). There was no evidence for inbreeding depression in G. urbanum,
   although significant, albeit low levels of inbreeding depression were
   detected in one of two G. rivale populations (delta = 0.33). The
   implication of these results is that if genetic material from G. rivale
   was incorporated into a hybrid with a selfing morphology, the
   establishment of this selfing lineage could be compromised by
   self-incompatibility and inbreeding depression. The wider implications
   of these results for evolution in hybrid swarms between G. urbanum and
   G. rivale are discussed. (C) 2010 The Linnean Society of London,

Abstract = {{Morphology, anatomy, ontogeny and chemical composition of inflorescences
   volatile secondary metabolites of Lippia alba (Verbenaceae) at three
   stages of development. There is an increased interest to know and
   scientifically validate traditional knowledge of medicinal plants.
   Lippia alba belongs to Verbenaceae family and has been of interest, not
   only because of its worldwide extensive distribution, but also for its
   variable use as antiviral, bactericide, citostatic, analgesic and
   sedative. To study this, the morphology and ontogeny of Lippia alba
   inflorescences and the chemical composition of its volatile secondary
   metabolites were analyzed during three different stages of development.
   Plants were collected at the experimental crop field in CENIVAM,
   Bucaramanga, Colombia. The inflorescence's morphology and ontogeny, and
   the chemical composition of volatile secondary metabolites were analyzed
   using a stereoscopic microscope and chromatographic and spectroscopic
   techniques. Fresh material corresponding to each stage was fixed in
   F.A.A (formol, acetic acid and alcohol), included in paraffin and cutted
   in transversal and longitudinal sections. Sections were stained with
   safranine-fastgreen, photographed and decribed. The chemical composition
   of volatile secondary metabolites at each ontogenic stage, was extracted
   by solid phase micro-extraction in the headspace mode and analyzed by
   gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Stage I showed a
   meristematic mass of cells in vegetative apex and bracts, with an
   outline of floral whorls. In Stage III, the stamens were adnate,
   epipetals and didynamous, bicarpelar and syncarpic gynoecium. with
   superior ovary and decurrent stigma. The main secondary metabolites
   detected were the bicyclosesquiphellandrene followed by carvone,
   limonene and trans-beta-farnesene, that constituted the 78\% of the
   total relative amounts of compounds. Other metabolites such as
   beta-copaene, gamma-amorphene and cis-beta-guaiene, were reported for
   the first time in this study. When compared to other studies,
   morphological differences reported in this study are possibly related to
   adaptation to environmental conditions or pollinators, which let us
   suggest that there is no specific ontogenic pattern. Similarly, the
   qualitative and quantitative variations in the detected compounds could
   be explained because one or more of them are used as precursors of
   others. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58(4): 1533-1548. Epub 2010 December 01.}},

Abstract = {{P>Background
   The allergic response in susceptible patients does not always coincide
   with the presence and magnitude of airborne pollen counts. The
   prevalence of allergy to Platanus is currently moderate, although the
   percentage of monosensitized patients is low. This hinders accurate
   interpretation of the relationship between the amount of pollen inhaled
   and the patient's symptoms.
   Objective
   This study aims to investigate the relationship between the atmospheric
   concentration pattern of Pla a 1 aeroallergen and the Platanus pollen.
   Methods
   The pollen sampling was carried out using a Hirst-type volumetric trap
   (Burkard ((C))) for pollen grains and a Burkard Cyclone sampler (Burkard
   ((C))) for Pla a 1 allergen. Serum-specific IgE levels to Acer sp.,
   Artemisia vulgaris, Betula alba, Chenopodium album, Cupressus arizonica,
   Cynodon dactylon, Fraxinus excelsior, Lolium perenne, Pinus sp.,
   Plantago lanceolata, Platanus acerifolia, Populus sp., Quercus ilex and
   Taraxacum officinale allergens were determined using the EAST System
   (Hytec specific IgE EIA kit; Hycor Biomedical, Kassel, Germany).
   Results
   The aerobiological dynamics of Platanus pollen grains and Pla a 1
   differed considerably, particularly during the Platanus pollination
   period. Of the 118 subjects tested, sera from 34 contained specific IgE
   to Platanus pollen and all of them had specific IgE to other pollen
   types.
   Conclusions
   The presence of the aeroallergen Pla a 1 in the atmosphere appears to be
   independent of Platanus pollen counts over the same period, which may be
   contributing to allergic symptoms and sensitization. The number of
   polysensitized patients displaying allergy to Platanus suggested that
   allergic symptoms were caused by co-sensitization or cross-reactivity
   involving a number of allergenic particles.

Abstract = {{In fragmented landscapes, small populations may be subjected to
   inbreeding or genetic drift. Gene flow is expected to alleviate the
   burden of deleterious mutations in such populations. The beneficial
   effects of outcrossing may, however, depend on life history
   characteristics such as the species' breeding system. Frequent selfing
   is expected to purge (sub) lethal alleles and mitigate inbreeding
   depression, at least if the load of mildly deleterious mutations has not
   accumulated through genetic drift in populations with a small effective
   size. Gene-inflow from distant source populations can cause outbreeding
   depression due to genomic incompatibilities. We tested these predictions
   using highly fragmented populations of the self-compatible forest herb
   Geum urbanum. Assessment of mating system parameters using
   microsatellite markers inferred high selfing rates (92.5\%), confirming
   the predominantly self-fertilizing character of the study species. We
   conducted experimental pollinations with self and outcross pollen
   collected from populations at different distances from the target
   populations. There were no significant signs of inbreeding depression,
   even in very small target populations. Except for a minor negative
   effect on the germination rate for the long-distance crosses, we found
   no effects of outbreeding on fitness estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, there is concern over the decline of bees, an ecologically
   important group of pollinating insects. Genetic studies provide insights
   into population structure that are crucial for conservation management
   but that would be impossible to obtain by conventional ecological
   methods. Yet conservation genetic studies of bees have primarily
   focussed on social species rather than the more species-rich solitary
   bees. Here, we investigate the population structure of Colletes
   floralis, a rare and threatened solitary mining bee, in Ireland and
   Scotland using nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was
   surprisingly as high in Scottish (Hebridean island) populations at the
   extreme northwestern edge of the species range as in mainland Irish
   populations further south. Extremely high genetic differentiation among
   populations was detected; multilocus F-ST was up to 0.53, and G'(ST) and
   D-est were even higher (maximum: 0.85 and 1.00, respectively). A pattern
   of isolation by distance was evident for sites separated by land. Water
   appears to act as a substantial barrier to gene flow yet sites separated
   by sea did not exhibit isolation by distance. C. floralis populations
   are extremely isolated and probably not in regional migration-drift
   equilibrium. GIS-based landscape genetic analysis reveals urban areas as
   a potential and substantial barrier to gene flow. Our results highlight
   the need for urgent site-specific management action to halt the decline
   of this and potentially other rare solitary bees.}},

Abstract = {{Adenocalymma bracteatum is a shrub of dense foliage and yellow flowers,
   easily found on grasslands areas in Central Brazil. The aim of this
   study was to determine the reproductive biology and the flower visitors
   of A. bracteatum in a pasture area nearby Ivinhema city, MS (Brazil).
   The flowering peak occurs in winter. The flower reflects ultraviolet
   light. Anthesis begins at 6:30h, and pollen and nectar are the resources
   to visitors. We captured 1,038 floral visitors. The bees Apis mellifera
   (L.), Trigona sp., Trigona spinipes (Fabricius), (Hymenoptera: Apoidea)
   and the ant Cephalotes sp. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) were the main
   visitors. The reproductive tests indicate that A. bracteatum is self
   compatible, justifying its expansion in altered environments; however,
   the largest reproductive success was dependant on cross-pollination and
   self-pollination, evidencing the pollinators importance. Adenocalymma
   bracteatum presents melittophilous syndrome and bumblebees were the main
   pollinators in the area. The correlations observed between the climatic
   variables and the main pollinator species were low or medium.}},

Abstract = {{Silene sennenii is an extremely narrow endemic species from the
   north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, with only five populations. Its
   habitat, severely affected by urban, industrial, and agricultural land
   use, is highly vulnerable, and makes of S. sennenii, a seriously
   endangered taxon. Its pollination ecology is studied and compared among
   populations. Flowers of S. sennenii are distinguished by several
   morphological and physiological characters, including night emission of
   scent, which are related to nocturnal pollination. Although visited by
   insects at night and during day, selective insect exclusion experiments
   show that this plant is pollinated mainly at night. However, differences
   among populations are observed in visitation rates and reproductive
   success, which indicates that the system composed by the plant and its
   pollinators show evidences of disruption in some populations. The causes
   and consequences of this disruption are analyzed, with a focus on
   differences in population size, habitat quality, and genetic diversity.
   The results are discussed from the perspective of the vulnerability of

Abstract = {{Southeast Asia experiences one of the highest rates of deforestation in
   the tropics due to agricultural expansion, logging, habitat
   fragmentation and urbanization, which are expected to result in species
   declines and extinctions. In particular, growing global demands for
   food, biofuel and other commodities are driving the rapid expansion of
   oil palm and paper-and-pulp industries at the expense of lowland
   dipterocarp forests, further jeopardizing Southeast Asian forest biotas.
   We synthesize recent findings on the effects of land-use changes on
   plants, invertebrates, vertebrates and ecosystem functioning/services in
   Southeast Asia. We find that species richness and abundance/density of
   forest-dependent taxa generally declined in disturbed compared to mature
   forests. Species with restricted ranges and those with habitat and
   foraging specialization were particularly vulnerable. Forest loss also
   disrupted vital ecosystem services (e.g. crop pollination). Long-term
   studies are needed to understand biotic sustainability in regenerating
   and degraded forests, particularly in the context of the synergistic or
   additive effects of multiple agents of biodiversity loss (e.g. invasive
   species and climate change). The preservation of large tracts of mature
   forests should remain the principal conservation strategy in the
   tropics. In addition, reforestation and reintroductions of native
   species, as well as improved connectivity among forest patches could
   enhance the conservation value of forest remnants in human-dominated
   landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Potential impacts of changes to Brazilian Forest Code in campos

Abstract = {{The Brazilian campos rupestres and campos de altitude are characterized
   by mosaics of vegetation types and are better represented above 900 m in
   the Espinhaco Range and above 1500-2000 m in the Serra do Mar and Serra
   da Mantiqueira. They bear high species richness at local and regional
   scales and numerous relicts and endemisms. These montane refuges, which
   are of particular interest to conservation in various ways, such as
   recharge and water regulation, control of erosion and sedimentation,
   biological singularity and recreational and spiritual values, are facing
   various threats such as erosion and soil instability, urban and
   agriculture sprawl, fires, removal of ornamental plants and milling.
   Moreover, these refuges are among the most vulnerable Brazilian
   ecosystems to global climate change, be,cause the simple fact that with
   increasing temperature there is no possibility to migrate to higher
   altitudes. This paper discusses the potential impacts of the proposed
   new Brazilian Forest Code, currently under discussion in the Congress,
   for the conservation of biodiversity in these environments. Particularly
   we analyze the consequences of the removal of areas above 1800 m and on
   the hill tops as Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs), the reducing on
   the minimum width of the riparian vegetation and the exemption to
   smallholders of the conservation of native vegetation on their lands
   ({''}Legal Reserves{''}). Such proposals seem to assume that there is
   great individual injury on behalf of a very diffuse collective benefit,
   but do not consider the direct benefits of the current instruments of
   the Code to rural land owners. The losses of biodiversity and ecosystem
   services (e.g., water supply, presence of pollinators, natural pest
   control and timber and non-wood resources) with the conversion of
   habitat that may result from those changes are disproportionate to the
   potential economic benefit. The instruments proposed on the new Code,
   ultimately, lead to a model of space occupation with strong contrasts,
   it means, fully protected areas, such as parks and biological reserves,
   alternated with extensive areas devoid of vegetation except thin
   riparian forests. Such a scenario is detrimental to the conservation of
   biodiversity and for agricultural production, especially to
   smallholders, who benefit directly from environmental services.}},

Abstract = {{Gametophytic self incompatibility (SI) in Citrus is known in pummelo,
   mandarin and many hybrid cultivars with pummelo in their pedigrees. What
   seems to be lacking, however, is determination of allelic variation in
   SI gene (S) and the genotypes of self incompatible and semi self
   incompatible cultivars. In previous studies, S genotypes of several
   Citrus cultivars were estimated on the basis of segregation distortion
   for Got-3 gene in F-1 progenies between these cultivars. In this study,
   S, seedlings were produced from self-pollinated `Hirado Buntan' pummelo,
   and homozygous S, seedlings for the S gene were determined by the
   pollination with `Hirado Buntan'. Then, the homozygous 5, seedlings were
   pollinated with the homozygous S, seedling (SaSa) each other and
   classified them into two genotype groups of SaSa and SbSb. The ten
   cultivars, whose S genotypes were predicted on the basis of joint
   segregation analysis with Got-3 gene in their progenies, were pollinated
   with the homozygous S, seedlings (SaSa or SbSb). Pollen tube behavior in
   the style of the ten Citrus cultivars after pollination with the S-a or
   S-b pollen led to the conclusion that `Hirado Buntan' has S-9 and S-10
   alleles. Furthermore, pollen tube arrest in the style of self compatible
   `Kabusu' sour orange pollinated with S-9 pollen suggested that the
   genotype of `Kabusu' is SS9. Inscrutably, neither S-9 nor S-10 alleles
   were found in a group belonging to the Hirado pummel line, which started
   from seeds sown by the 11th feudal load Terasu Matsura of the domain of
   Hirado. This fact supported the two origins of Hirado pummelo plants
   described in the literature, and indicated the association of multiple
   seed and/or pollen parents with different S alleles to the original seed
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Flower fluorescence has been previously proposed as a potential visual
   signal to attract pollinators. In this work, this point was addressed by
   quantitatively measuring the fluorescence quantum yield (I broken
   vertical bar (f)) for flowers of Bellis perennis (white, yellow, pink,
   and purple), Ornithogalum thyrsoides (petals and ovaries), Limonium
   sinuatum (white and yellow), Lampranthus productus (yellow), Petunia
   nyctaginiflora (white), Bougainvillea spectabilis (white and yellow),
   Antirrhinum majus (white and yellow), Eustoma grandiflorum (white and
   blue), Citrus aurantium (petals and stigma), and Portulaca grandiflora
   (yellow). The highest values were obtained for the ovaries of O.
   thyrsoides (I broken vertical bar (f) = 0.030) and for Citrus aurantium
   petals (I broken vertical bar (f) = 0.014) and stigma (I broken vertical
   bar (f) = 0.013). Emitted photons as fluorescence were compared with
   reflected photons. It was concluded that the fluorescence emission is
   negligible compared to the reflected light, even for the most
   fluorescent samples, and it may not be considered as an optical signal
   in biocommunication. The work was complemented with the calculation of
   quantum catches for each studied flower species to describe the visual
   sensitization of eye photoreceptors.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical and biochemical properties of standard, hybrid, and grafted
   melons cultivated under the same agricultural conditions in adjacent
   fields in the Cumra region of Turkey were investigated and compared
   based on pH, Brix, antioxidant activity, total phenolics, ascorbic acid,
   individual phenolics, sugar, and organic acid values. Seventeen
   different phenolic constituents were quantified by reverse phase
   high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The highest phenolic
   acid variability and content were detected in the standard melon. Sugar
   and organic acid compositions of melon cultivars were tested by
   capillary electrophoresis, and significant differences in types and
   contents of individual sugars and organic acids were determined among
   the cultivars. Standard Cinikiz Cumra melons had the highest ascorbic
   acid, total phenolics, and total sugar contents. The fructose/glucose
   ratio increased three times in grafted melon as compared with standard
   melon. While sugar alcohol mannitol existed in the standard and hybrid
   cultivars, this constituent disappeared in the grafted types. Citric
   acid found in the standard cultivar was not detected in the hybrid and
   grafted types. Consequently, it was concluded that the nutritional value
   of melons changed by the application of hybridization, grafting, or
   standard (open pollinated) production methods. The standard melon was
   found to have the highest score in terms of taste, because of its
   highest sweetness and sourness. It was also found preferable because of
   its high antioxidant activity, total phenolic and ascorbic acid
   contents.}},

Abstract = {{Background. - Respiratory allergic diseases are currently a major public
   health problem worldwide, especially in industrialized countries.
   Although the symptoms associated with these affections coincide with the
   pollination season, it is now well established that simple and direct
   relations do not exist between these two phenomena and that, in the same
   time, several other factors - air pollutants and meteorological factors
   - must be taken into account.
   Objective. - To correlate atmospheric parameters with the medical
   consultations in response to rhinitis and asthma symptoms.
   Methods. - This study was conducted in the city of Amiens, during the
   pollen season in 2007. Clinical results were provided from the Picardie
   Regional Health Observatory. The atmospheric data gathered the count of
   pollen grains, the concentrations of gaseous air pollutants and several
   meteorological parameters. The correlations between these parameters are
   carried out using simple and multiple linear regressions.
   Results. - The consultations for rhinitis were positively correlated
   with grass pollen counts and atmospheric ozone, whereas asthma was
   correlated with precipitations. The results of multiple linear
   regressions showed that the two allergic symptoms, rhinitis and asthma,
   were related to several atmospheric factors, in particular airborne
   grass pollen, gaseous pollutants and temperature.
   Conclusion. - The large size of pollen grains could explain the simple
   relationship between rhinitis and grass pollen, because pollen grains
   can penetrate only the higher respiratory tract. This effect was not
   observed for asthma, but a positive relationship between asthma and
   precipitation suggests a potential role of pollen cytoplasmic granules.
   Theses granules could massively increase asthma attacks during the
   pollen season. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fragmentation is a critical issue for tree populations because the
   creation of small patches can reduce local population size and increase
   isolation, both of which can promote inbreeding and its negative
   consequences, as well as loss of genetic diversity. To test the
   hypothesis that patch size and isolation influence mating patterns or
   seed production in forest trees, we utilize the spatial array of trees
   of an urban population of Chinese Pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.)
   planted in patches around Beijing. Our design includes 28 urban patches,
   with patch size ranging from 1 to 2000 adult trees and isolation (edge
   distance index) ranging from 37.5 m to 245.8 m. We examined the average
   number of seeds per cone and percentage of viable seed per cone for each
   patch as measures of seed production. By utilizing seven paternally
   inherited chloroplast microsatellite loci, we estimated the mating
   pattern parameters for each patch, including the level of selling, the
   amount of immigrant pollen and the effective number of pollen sources
   (N-ep). Using a general linear model selection procedure based on AIC
   value, we found patch size was the best predictor of the selling and
   immigration rate; smaller patches had a higher selfing and immigration
   rate. Small patches with one adult had relatively high Nep which
   indicates connectivity among urban patches. However, due to the reduced
   amount of immigrant pollen and limited diversity of local pollen,
   intermediate sized patches (with 5-10 adults) had the lowest N-ep among
   the study patches. For patches with more than 10 adults, Nep was
   increased with patch size. The percentage of viable seeds per cone
   significantly decreased with patch size, indicating a possible negative
   consequence of inbreeding. The effect of patch size on mating patterns
   and seed production suggests that the patches of trees experience less
   connectivity than trees within continuous forest. These findings
   indicate that forest management practices should emphasize the
   maintenance of an optimal patch size because, despite the fact that tree
   species show the potential for long distance pollen movement, the number
   of local trees strongly influences the mating patterns. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean region respiratory allergies due to Poaceae pollen
   have increased during the last few decades despite the fall in
   atmospheric grass pollen levels recorded in some cities. We study
   whether airborne grass pollen trends have increased or decreased in a
   coastal city of the Mediterranean Basin, analysing not only annual and
   spring amounts but also phenological trends. We look to climatic change
   as the possible cause of any of these tendencies, without forgetting
   possible changes in land use in recent years. Since 1970s, Malaga has
   seen its annual mean temperature rise by 0.06 degrees C/year. Some
   meteorologists have observed certain tendencies in the rainfall of the
   western Mediterranean area. As regards winds (barely studied), the
   frequency of calm has decreased and ``levant winds{''} blowing off the
   sea have become more frequent, while SW winds have decreased in spring.
   The object of this contribution, then, is to analyse and individually
   explain the relation between (and possible influence of) each
   significant climatic trend and each significant atmospheric pollen
   trend. We have considered as significant the trends (regression lines)
   whose fitted points, determined by R(2), provided a p value of <= 0.05.
   We have obtained important results that allow us to explain the
   influence of certain climatic factors on the growth and pollination of
   these plants. During the springs of 1992-2007 there was a significant
   tendency for airborne grass pollen levels to increase, the number of
   days with high atmospheric concentrations (>100 grains/m(3) air) also
   increasing, which would explain the increase in allergenic illnesses
   (pollinosis) recorded in the population of Malaga. This increased amount
   of spring pollen is associated with higher than usual rainfall and
   minimum temperatures during early spring (March and April), which would
   favour seed germination and vegetative growth in these plants. The
   increased rainfall of early spring is also associated with the tendency
   for pollination to start later. Lastly, the end of pollination was
   brought forward significantly, with the consequent shortening of the
   overall pollination season by 1 week/year. This fact is significantly
   associated with the frequency of spring winds (more wind from directions
   unfavourable for pollen registration and fewer winds from favourable
   directions) and also with the tendency for the springs to be warmer,
   leading to plant wilting and parching. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to evaluate the rate of gene flow between
   GM (RR) and conventional soybeans, in the city of Alfenas, in the south
   region of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The work was carried out in the
   Horticultural Section and Experimentation of the University Jose do
   Rosario Vellano - UNIFENAS, in the period of October of 2004 trougth
   November of 2005. It were been used two cultivars of soybeans (Glicine
   max): one traditional cultivar {[}MG/BR 46 (Conquista)], not tolerant to
   the glyphosate, and other cultivar (BRS Valiosa) resistant to the
   molecule from glyphosate. The experimental area was delineated by sowing
   in concentric circles with rays of 1, 2, 3, 4 m for the plant of the
   cultivar not genetically modified (Conquista) and 5 m for the plants of
   the cultivar genetically modified. Plants removed of both the
   populations had received an application from glyphosate, by the the
   applications of the commercial product Roundup, in the dosis of 1.0
   L.ha(-1) when they had reached the V3 stadium, with the objective of
   certification of the resistance to the herbicide. The RR gene flow in
   soybeans occurs at low taxes (maximum of 0.25\%) in the conditions of
   Alfenas - MG, Brazil. However, these fact indicates a potential of
   contamination in soybeans plants not genetically modified growing near
   the RR plants.}},

Abstract = {{Stylosanthes viscosa is a common `herb' in the tropical sand dunes of
   the Brazilian coast with clumped distribution in urban sand dunes of
   Salvador, BA. Its tiny keel flower with a very small amount of nectar
   hidden inside the corolla tube, a single open flower/inflorescence/day
   and the low floral density altogether should not be attractive to large
   bees. This should be true mainly upon the high-demanded energy for
   thermoregulation within the tropical sand dunes. Contrary to this
   expectation, most of the bee species sampled on S. viscosa flowers were
   medium to large sized bees and harvested nectar in legitimate visits by
   activating the keel's pollination mechanism of flowers. However, the
   keel was always inactivated after being visited by the enormous and
   frequent (78\%) Xylocopa bees. All the flowers visited by these bees
   (including those with inactivated keels), and those experimentally
   protected from bee visiting produced fruits (100\%). The specialized
   embolus mechanism of the anthers assures self-pollination. Because of
   this autonomous self-pollination and self-compatibility it was not
   possible to discriminate the relative importance of both facilitated
   self-pollination and cross-pollination by bees. Nevertheless, the large
   Xylocopa bees didn't limit self-pollination. Xylocopa cearensis was the
   most abundant bee (63\%) and it visited several flowers (13.0 +/- 4.27)
   in each flight route in the same clump, in spite of the low floral
   density therein (5 to 20 flowers.m(-2)). Flight distances between
   successive flowers varied between one and two meters (49\%), and so they
   were higher than would be possible (15 to 70 cm) given the floral
   density in the clumps. The flight routes were directional, and most of
   shifting direction between successive flowers was below 90 degrees with
   high frequency of small angles (<30 degrees). This general pattern is
   explained by foraging optimization with adjustments to critical resource
   level thresholds. Paradoxically, floral biology and flowering pattern of
   S. viscosa should discourage the largest dune dweller bees, but this
   strategy works just temporarily. In this melittophilous species, the
   autonomous self-pollination (assured by the embolus) can be better
   explained by the automatic selection hypothesis rather than by
   reproductive assurance hypothesis, considering the availability of large
   bee pollinators in the tropical dunes.}},

Abstract = {{During growth, ripening, and post-harvest, the quality of fruits can be
   modified by various stresses. Ample maturation allows prolonged storage
   and increases the quality of citrus fruits. The eight major volatile
   compounds in fresh juices from mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco var.
   Willow Leaf), clementine (Citrus reticulata x Citrus sinensis var.
   Commune), and their six cross-pollinated hybrids were quantified by gas
   chromatography. Mandarin juice contained the highest volatile
   concentration (2177.6 +/- A 110.6 mg L(-1)), whereas the total aromatic
   compounds of the hybrid and clementine juices were lower (1060.6 +/- A
   81.6-1724.2 +/- A 138.5 mg L(-1) and 864.8 +/- A 67.8 mg L(-1),
   respectively). Limonene was the major compound (667.3 +/- A 53.7-1259.9
   +/- A 98.4 mg L(-1)) in all juices. We observed significant differences
   according to the process of juice extraction used (with and without
   peel). The relative volatile concentration was higher when the juice was
   extracted with peel, and the juicing process induced differences in the
   relative volatile concentrations of between 20 and 40\%. The levels of
   volatile compounds in the juice changed according to the degree of fruit
   maturity. The concentrations of the eight major juice components
   increased during ripening and until the commercial maturity stage when
   the juice was obtained from peeled fruits, whereas their concentrations
   increased until the post-maturation stage when the juices were produced
   from whole fruits. These two factors determined the contributions of
   these compounds to the characteristic aromas of Citrus juices.}},

Abstract = {{A number of studies have investigated the quality of journals in

   investigates the exchange of ideas within Operations Management journals
   and between other management disciplines (Management, Marketing, and

   provide a measure for the exchange of scholarly ideas. Operations
   Management (OM) journals show a willingness to cross-pollinate ideas
   with other management disciplines. But, they also tend to have a higher
   level of self citations and lower level of within discipline citation
   exchanges when compared to other management disciplines. As a result,
   Operations Management journals may reflect methodological silos in the
   field that could potentially dampen scholarly exchange. In general,
   increasing the diversity of scholarly exchanges within Operations
   Management, and conducting more cross-disciplinary research with other

Abstract = {{To induce haploid plants in Citrus maxima (Burm.) Merr. `Banpeiyu', we
   evaluated the effect of pollination with soft X-ray-irradiated pollen on
   fruit set and seed development, and carried out ovule culture. When
   `Banpeiyu' pummelo pistils were pollinated with X-ray-irradiated pollen
   of `Fukuhara' sweet orange {[}C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck], the exposure
   doses affected the fruit set. The number of seeds per fruit was also
   affected by the exposure dose, and tended to decrease as the dose
   increased; however, all developed seeds obtained from these crosses were
   diploid. In the ovule culture of `Banpeiyu' pummel, six embryoids shown
   haploidy were obtained in all treatments. One haploid plantlet with 9
   chromosomes was regenerated from an embryoid in a culture of ovules
   established 40 days after pollination with 400 Gray (Gy)-irradiated
   pollen of `Tosa-buntan' pummelo (C. maxima). This haploid was suggested
   to be derived from `Banpeiyu' pummelo by random amplified polymorphic
   DNA (RAPD) and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Urban areas are a particular landscape matrix characterized by a
   fine-grained spatial arrangement of very diverse habitats (urban
   mosaic). We investigated arthropods to analyse biodiversity-habitat
   associations along five environmental gradients (age, impervious area,
   management, configuration, composition) in three Swiss cities (96 study
   sites). We considered total species richness and species richness within
   different functional groups (zoophagous, phytophagous, pollinator, low
   mobility, and high mobility species). Information theoretical model
   selection procedures were applied and predictions were calculated based
   on weighted models. Urban areas yielded on average 284 arthropod species
   (range: 169-361), with species richness correlating mostly with
   heterogeneity indices (configuration and composition). Species richness
   also increased with age of urban settlement, while enlarged proportions
   of impervious area and intensified habitat management was negatively
   correlated. Functional groups showed contrasted, specific responses to
   environmental variables. Overall, we found surprisingly little variation
   in species richness along the gradients, which is possibly due to the
   fine-grained spatial interlinkage of good (heterogeneous) and bad
   (sealed) habitats. The highly fragmented nature of urban areas may not
   represent a major obstacle for the arthropods currently existing in
   cities because they have probably been selected for tolerance to
   fragmentation and for high colonisation potential. Given that built
   areas are becoming denser, increasing spatial heterogeneity of the urban
   green offers potential for counteracting the detrimental effects of
   densification upon urban biodiversity. By quantifying the expected
   effects along environmental gradients, this study provides guidance for
   managers to set priorities when enhancing urban arthropod species
   richness.}},

Abstract = {{We found that diploid seedless watermelon can be produced by pollination
   with partially functional pollen, which was irradiated with gamma-rays
   at the doses of 600 and 800 Gy. The diploid seedless fruits were almost
   similar to normal fruits in development from pollination to maturity.
   The number of empty seeds in the diploid seedless fruits varied among
   the cultivars used. Seedless watermelon cultivars revealed a significant
   increase in total sugar and carotenoids (lycopene and gb-carotene)
   contents. The pollen tubes of the pollen subjected to gamma-radiation
   penetrated normally into the synergid, and sperm cells were discharged.
   Subsequently, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus became attached to each
   other in the egg cell and a globular embryo was formed. However, the
   embryo failed to differentiate the tissues and degenerated. It is
   suggested that seedless watermelon fruits induced by gamma-rays are
   characterized by increasing yield and better quality due to higher
   carotenoid and total sugar contents and fruit weight. In some cultivars,
   there is a tendency in decreasing the thickness of rind.}},

Abstract = {{Although insect pollination is fundamental to the persistence of plants
   in restored habitats, it is rarely taken in to account in evaluations of
   restoration success. We evaluated a recovery of interactions between the
   insect-pollinated shrub Dillwynia sieberi and its pollinator assemblage
   dominated by exotic honeybee Apis mellifera in 5-year-old revegetated
   pastures and remnants of endangered Cumberland Plain Woodland (the aim
   of revegetation) in Sydney, Australia. We examined plant size, plant
   flower density, flower visitation rates by insects, counts of pollen per
   stigma and presence/absence of germinated pollen, fruit and seed set
   ratios and rates of pre-dispersal seed predation. Flower densities on
   plants in restored areas were significantly higher than in forest
   remnants. Bees were the most common flower visitors. Plants in
   revegetated areas attracted significantly more flower visitors with
   visitor assemblages usually dominated by A. mellifera. Plants in
   revegetated areas had similar numbers of flowers per inflorescence,
   while fruit and seed set per inflorescence was significantly higher in
   forest remnants. There was no significant difference in the rates of
   pre-dispersal seed predation. Plants in revegetated areas and forest
   remnants had similar seed output with no apparent negative effect of A.
   mellifera on seed production. Restoration of native vegetation in an
   urban context is a challenging long-term process. However, introduction
   of dominant plant species can foster a rapid return of their
   pollinators. The interactions between the plants and their native
   pollinators were resilient to pervasive exotic A. mellifera, and plants
   in restored ecosystems had an adequate reproductive output. (C) 2010

Title = {{Mitochondrial heteroplasmy and DNA barcoding in Hawaiian Hylaeus
   (Nesoprosopis) bees (Hymenoptera: Colletidae)}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: The past several years have seen a flurry of papers seeking
   to clarify the utility and limits of DNA barcoding, particularly in
   areas such as species discovery and paralogy due to nuclear pseudogenes.
   Heteroplasmy, the coexistence of multiple mitochondrial haplotypes in a
   single organism, has been cited as a potentially serious problem for DNA
   barcoding but its effect on identification accuracy has not been tested.
   In addition, few studies of barcoding have tested a large group of
   closely-related species with a well-established morphological taxonomy.
   In this study we examine both of these issues, by densely sampling the
   Hawaiian Hylaeus bee radiation.
   Results: Individuals from 21 of the 49 a priori morphologically-defined
   species exhibited coding sequence heteroplasmy at levels of 1-6\% or
   more. All homoplasmic species were successfully identified by COI using
   standard methods of analysis, but only 71\% of heteroplasmic species.
   The success rate in identifying heteroplasmic species was increased to
   86\% by treating polymorphisms as character states rather than
   ambiguities. Nuclear pseudogenes (numts) were also present in four
   species, and were distinguishable from heteroplasmic sequences by
   patterns of nucleotide and amino acid change.
   Conclusions: Heteroplasmy significantly decreased the reliability of
   species identification. In addition, the practical issue of dealing with
   large numbers of polymorphisms- and resulting increased time and labor
   required - makes the development of DNA barcode databases considerably
   more complex than has previously been suggested. The impact of
   heteroplasmy on the utility of DNA barcoding as a bulk specimen
   identification tool will depend upon its frequency across populations,
   which remains unknown. However, DNA barcoding is still likely to remain
   an important identification tool for those species that are difficult or
   impossible to identify through morphology, as is the case for the
   ecologically important solitary bee fauna.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of the study were to analyse characteristics of the Castanea

   sampling stations in north-west Croatia. The study was conducted in
   Zagreb and Samobor during the 2003-2006 periods, using the seven-day
   volumetric samplers of the Hirst design. In both study areas, the
   seasons of chestnut pollination were similar and lasted from June to the
   end of July, which is comparable to other European cities. A general
   rule was noticed - the shorter the main pollen season, the higher the
   pollen peak concentration. Although the pollen season of Fagales pollen
   is prolonged to summer in the area of inland west-north Croatia due to
   the genus Castanea summer pollination, the number of days with pollen
   air concentration higher than 50 per m(3) was low and was not likely to
   have any major effects in allergic individuals. Airborne pollen
   concentration of Castanea showed positive statistically significant
   correlation with air temperature and negative non-significant
   correlation with precipitation. Because of the non-significant
   differences between the two stations, for a possible long-term forecast
   model for Fagales airborne pollen for this part of north-west Croatia,
   aerobiological data obtained from only one station are sufficient.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic diversity of the Turkish watermelon genetic resources was
   evaluated using different Citrullus species, wild relatives, foreign
   landraces, open pollinated (OP) and commercial hybrid cultivars by RAPD
   markers. The germplasm was consisted of 303 accessions collected from
   various geographical regions. Twenty-two of 35 RAPD primers generated a
   total of 241 reproducible bands, 146 (60.6\%) of which were polymorphic.
   Based on the RAPD data the genetic similarity coefficients were
   calculated and the dendrogram was constructed using UPGMA (Unweighted
   pair-group method with arithmetic average). Cluster analysis of the 303
   accessions employing RAPD data resulted in a multi-branched dendrogram
   indicating that most of the Turkish accessions belonging to var. lanatus
   of Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum et Nakai were grouped together.
   Accessions of different Citrullus species and Praecitrullus fistulosus
   (Stocks) Pangalo formed distant clusters from C. lanatus var. lanatus.
   Among 303 accessions, a subset of 56 accessions was selected
   representing different groups and a second dendrogram was constructed.
   The genetic similarity coefficients (GS) within the Turkish accessions
   were ranged from 0.76 to 1.00 with 0.94 average indicating that they are
   closely related. Taken together, our results indicated that low genetic
   variability exist among the watermelon genetic resources collected from
   Turkey contrary to their remarkable phenotypic diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive biology of the mycoheterotrophic Voyria caerulea, V.
   clavata and V rosea (Gentianaceae) was studied in French Guiana. Floral
   characteristics indicated adaptations to long-tongued flower visitors.
   The three species possess large, conspicuously colored flowers that
   produced sucrose-rich nectar (concentrations: 16.4\%-23.9\%) and emit a
   rosy floral perfume with a citrus-related aspect, dominated by
   terpenoids. Principal scent compounds of V. caerulea and V rosea were
   (E)-nerolidol and geraniol, and (E)-8-oxo-beta-farnesene
   {[}(E)-2,6-dimethyl-10-methylenedodeca-2,6,11-trien-5-one, a new natural
   product] and (E,E)-farnesyl acetate in V. clavata. Germinating pollen
   grains were observed in the anthers of all species, forming large
   interwoven clumps that were transferred by the pollinators as a unit. In
   V. caerulea and V. rosea, stamens and stigmas were positioned close
   together, enabling the plants to self-pollinate. In contrast, male and
   female organs are widely separated in V. clavaia. Pollen to ovule ratios
   of all species were low (33-78), indicating that pollen transfer (either
   by selling or by outcrossing) is very efficient. Flower visitors were
   butterflies (V. caerulea, V. rosea) and/or long-tongued bees of the
   genus Euglossa (V. clavata, V. rosea). Nevertheless, Voyria caerulea and
   V. rosea were visited only rarely and irregularly. We suggest that these
   two species follow a mixed selfing-outcrossing strategy to ensure seed
   production when pollen transfer by visitors fails. In contrast, V.
   clavata showed a high degree of specialization towards
   euglossine-pollinators, which were frequent visitors. The close
   plant-pollinator interaction increases the probability of outcrossings
   and might have enabled this species to completely rely on pollinators
   for reproduction. Average seed set in the studied species ranged between
   36\% and 49\% and was very variable among individuals, probably due to
   resource-limitation. The capsules of V. caerulea and V. clavata showed
   characteristics of endozoochorous dispersal and were frequently found
   damaged by possible rodent dispersal agents.}},

Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{We study whether butterfly diet predicts butterfly distribution along an
   urban gradient. Data come from a large scale participatory scheme
   involving the general public reporting butterfly abundance in their
   gardens (more than 6000 gardens), completed by a special survey on the
   relationship between butterfly species and flower species based on
   amateur pictures (more than 3500 pictures). Many studies show that
   urbanization promotes the loss of native plant species and their
   replacement by non-native species, so in this context we addressed the
   question of butterfly diet impacts provided by exotic and native plants
   in urban landscapes and we quantified diet diversity to identify
   specialist and generalist butterflies. Diet specialists had a longer
   proboscis and both specialization and proboscis length were positively
   correlated to preferences for exotic flowers. Nevertheless, diet
   specialist butterflies tended to avoid urban areas more strongly than
   diet generalists, while preference for exotic flowers was surprisingly
   not correlated to preferences for urban life in butterflies. All
   together this suggests that diet preferences do not play a strong part
   in determining butterfly distribution along urban gradients but also
   that diet specialization must be correlated to other life history traits
   such as dispersal ability or flexibility in habitat selection. (C) 2010

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},

Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{Neotropical orchid bees (Euglossini) are often cited as classic examples
   of trapline-foragers with potentially extensive foraging ranges. If
   long-distance movements are habitual, rare plants in widely scattered
   locations may benefit from euglossine pollination services. Here we
   report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track the
   movement of an insect pollinator in a complex and forested environment.
   Our results indicate that individual male orchid bees (Exaerete
   frontalis) habitually use large rainforest areas (at least 42-115 ha) on
   a daily basis. Aerial telemetry located individuals up to 5 km away from
   their core areas, and bees were often stationary, for variable periods,
   between flights to successive localities. These data suggest a higher
   degree of site fidelity than what may be expected in a free living male
   bee, and has implications for our understanding of biological activity
   patterns and the evolution of forest pollinators.}},

Volume = {{91}},

Abstract = {{Studies simultaneously evaluating the importance of safe-site and seed
   limitation for plant establishment are rare, particularly in
   human-modified landscapes. We used spatially,explicit neighborhood
   models together with data from 10 0.5-ha mapped census plots in a
   fragmented landscape spanning 1000 km(2) to (1) evaluate the relative
   importance of seed production, dispersal, and safe-site limitation for
   the recruitment of the understory herb Heliconia acuminata; and (2)
   determine how these processes differ between fragments and continuous
   forests. Our analyses demonstrated a large degree of variation in seed
   production, dispersal, and establishment among and within the 10 study
   plots. Seed production limitation was strong but only at small spatial
   scales. Average dispersal distance was less than 4 m, leading to severe
   dispersal limitation at most sites. Overall, safe-site limitation was
   the most important constraint on seedling establishment. Fragmentation
   led to a more heterogeneous light environment with negative consequences
   for seedling establishment but had little effect on seed production or
   dispersal. These results suggest that the effects of fragmentation on
   abiotic processes may be more important than the disruption of biotic
   interactions in driving biodiversity loss in tropical forests, at least
   for some functional groups. These effects May be common when the matrix
   surrounding fragments contains enough tree cover to enable movement of
   dispersers and pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Many ecosystem services are in decline. Local ecological knowledge and
   associated practice are essential to sustain and enhance ecosystem
   services on the ground. Here, we focus on social or collective memory in
   relation to management practice that sustains ecosystem services, and
   investigate where and how ecological practices, knowledge and experience
   are retained and transmitted. We analyze such social-ecological memory
   of allotment gardens in the Stockholm urban area, Sweden. Allotment
   gardens support ecosystem services such as pollination, seed dispersal
   and pest regulation in the broader urban landscape. Surveys and
   interviews were preformed over a four-year period with several hundreds
   of gardeners. We found that the allotment gardens function as
   communities-of-practice, where participation and reification interact
   and social-ecological memory is a shared source of resilience of the
   community by being both emergent and persistent. Ecological practices
   and knowledge in allotment gardens are retained and transmitted by
   imitation of practices, oral communication and collective rituals and
   habits, as well as by the physical gardens, artifacts, metaphors and
   rules-in-use (institutions). Finally, a wider social context provides
   external support through various forms of media, markets, social
   networks, collaborative organizations, and legal structures. We
   exemplify the role of urban gardens in generating ecosystem services in
   times of crisis and change and conclude that stewards of urban green
   areas and the social memory that they carry may help counteract further
   decline of critical ecosystem services. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Urban sprawl has led over wide areas to alteration and fragmentation of
   so many ecosystem types that it becomes essential to consider
   biodiversity conservation in urban planning. As the urbanisation is
   usually irreversible, the urban context has to be taken into account
   when defining appropriate management measures to sustain viable
   populations. Connectivity through pollen flow appears to be a key-factor
   for the long-term persistence of populations of insect-pollinated plant
   species. We investigated pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as
   pollen analogue in Lychnis flos-cuculi, an insect-pollinated wetland
   herb, along the Woluwe River, in Brussels urban zone (Belgium). Dye
   dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with particles
   mainly deposited on neighbouring individuals and populations. The mean
   distance of dye transfer was 133.6 m, with a maximal distance of 523.7
   m. Dye deposition was positively related to the number of potential
   recipient plants when distance to dye source was held constant. This may
   be associated with a higher flowering plant density across the flying
   distance that increases attractiveness and visitation rate of
   pollinators, and/or with secondary dye transfer. When connected, small
   and large populations only differed in response to the number of
   potential recipients. The small isolated population received little
   immigrant pollen flow, but remained a dye donor. Our study demonstrates
   that small populations of L. flos-cucli along an urban river may still
   exchange pollen thanks to pollinator movements, and might therefore be
   regarded in management planning as potential connecting components
   between populations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Five watermelon varieties with different flesh colors: ``ZAOHUA{''}
   (red); ``96B41{''} (pink); ``307CHAO-FENG{''} (yellow); ``UNKNOWN{''}
   (orange); and ``SANBAI{''} (white) were used to investigate the
   relationship between carotenoid profiles and expression of
   carotenoid-related genes during fruit development and ripening. In
   mature fruit, ``ZAOHUA{''} and ``96B41{''} accumulated high level of
   lycopene, ``SANBAI{''} contained trace amounts of carotenoids. Through
   HPLC and dot blot hybridization, carotenoid content was analyzed and
   compared to the expression of carotenoid-related genes including Psy,
   Pds, Zds, Crtlso, Lcyb, Chyb, Nced1, Nced2, Nced3 during fruit
   development. All genes examined were expressed in all five watermelon
   varieties. In red and pink color varieties, the decrease of gene
   expression for Lcyb and Chyb at stage C (30 d after pollination) may be
   consistent with the high accumulation of lycopene and beta-carotene. In
   the yellow variety, expression of the detected genes increased markedly
   with the onset of maturation, but little carotenoid accumulation was
   detected, which may be due to high level of carotenoid cleavage
   dioxygenases. Expression of all detected genes decreased rapidly in the
   white color variety upon fruit ripening, which may be attributed to a
   reduction in metabolic flux in the carotenoid pathway. These results
   imply the complex regulation of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in
   watermelon. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Use of Commercially Available Pollenizers for Optimizing Triploid
   Watermelon Production}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted during 2005 and 2006 in Kinston, NC, with
   the objective of maximizing triploid watermelon {[} Citrullus lanatus
   (Thunb.) Matsum, and Nak.] fruit yield and quality by optimizing the
   choice and use of pollenizers. Treatments were pollenizer cultivars
   planted singly {[}'Companion', `Super Pollenizer 1' ('SP1'), `Summer
   Flavor 800' ('SF800'), and `Mickylee'] or in pairs ('Companion' + `SP1',
   `Companion' + `SF800', and `SP1' + `SF800'). All pollenizers from these
   seven treatments were inter-planted with the triploid cultivar
   Tri-X-313. Planting arrangement was compared by establishing `SF800' in
   a hill versus an interplanted held arrangement. Effect of pollenizer
   establishment timing on triploid fruit yields and quality was evaluated
   by establishing `SP1' 3 weeks after planting and comparing it with the
   establishment of `SP1' at the time of triploid plant establishment.
   Finally, a triploid planting with no pollenizer (control) was included
   to determine pollen movement. Fruit yield from the control was 22\% or
   less of yield of the other treatments containing a pollenizer and less
   than 10\% in the initial or early harvests. Pollen movement was minimal
   among plots and differences in yield and fruit quality could be at to
   pollenizer treatment. In 2005, the use of `Companion', `SP1', or
   `Mickylee' as pollenizers produced similar total yields, whereas `SF800'
   produced the lowest yield. In 2005, `Companion' produced more large
   fruit than the other individual pollenizer treatments. Combining the
   pollenizers generally did not enhance triploid yields or quality.
   Interplanting of pollenizers consistently resulted in greater yield
   compared with the hill system. Late planting of `SP1' increased the
   incidence of hollow heart in the marketable fruit and decreased yield
   compared with simultaneously planting `SP1' and triploid plants. Thus,
   selection of pollenizer, planting arrangement, and time of pollenizer
   establishment are all important considerations to optimizing triploid
   yield and quality.}},

Abstract = {{Jatropha curcas L. (Physic nut) is a commercially important non-edible
   oil seed crop known for its use as an alternate source of biodiesel. In
   order to investigate the morphogenic potential of immature embryo,
   explants from four developmental stages were cultured on medium
   supplemented with combinations of auxins and cytokinins. It was found
   that the size of embryo is critical for the establishment of callus.
   Immature embryos (1.1-1.5 cm) obtained from the fruits 6 weeks after
   pollination showed a good response of morphogenic callus induction
   (85.7\%) and subsequent plant regeneration (70\%) with the maximum
   number of plantlets (4.7/explant) on Murashige and Skoog's (MS) medium
   supplemented with IBA (0.5 mg l(-1)) and BA (1.0 mg l(-1)). The above
   medium when supplemented with growth adjuvants such as 100 mg l(-1)
   casein hydrolysate + 200 mg l(-1) l-glutamine + 8.0 mg l(-1) CuSO4
   resulted in an even higher frequency of callus induction (100\%). Plant
   regeneration (90\%) with the maximum number of plantlets (10/explant)
   was achieved on MS medium supplemented with 500 mg l(-1) polyvinyl
   pyrrolidone + 30 mg l(-1) citric acid + 1 mg l(-1) BA + 0.5 mg l(-1) Kn
   + 0.25 mg l(-1) IBA. It was observed that plantlet regeneration could
   occur either through organogenesis of morphogenic callus or via
   multiplication of pre-existing meristem in immature embryos. The age of
   immature embryos and addition of a combination of growth adjuvants to
   the culture medium appear to be critical for obtaining high regeneration
   rates. Well-developed shoots rooted on half-strength MS medium
   supplemented with 0.5 mg l(-1) IBA and 342 mg l(-1) trehalose. The
   rooted plants after acclimatization were successfully transferred to the
   field in different agro-climatic zones in India. This protocol has been
   successfully evaluated on five elite lines of J. curcas.}},

Abstract = {{Latitudinal shifts in tree species distributions are a potential impact
   of climate change on forest ecosystems. It has been hypothesized that
   some tree species may become extirpated as climate change effects may
   exceed their migration ability. The goal of this study was to compare
   tree species compositions in northern urban areas to tree compositions
   in forestland areas in the eastern U.S. as an indicator of the potential
   for urban trees to facilitate future forest tree species migration.
   Results indicated that a number of tree species native to eastern U.S.
   forests of southern latitudes are currently present in northern urban
   forests. The biomass density (Mg/ha) of urban tree species is typically
   less than half of forestland densities with the majority of urban tree
   species found in nearby (<100 km) forestland. Urban tree propagation is
   often facilitated by humans, whereas the necessary pollinators and
   agents of tree seed dispersal in forestlands may be lacking regardless
   of climate change. It is suggested that urban areas may serve divergent,
   dual roles as both a native tree seed source and refuge for a limited
   number of forestland tree species, but also a facilitator of non-native
   tree invasion. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{408}},

Abstract = {{There is a profound relation between human health and well being from
   the one side and air pollution levels from the other. Air quality in
   South of France and more specifically in Nice, is known to be bad,
   especially in summer. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test has been
   developed for detecting and estimating monotonic trends in the time
   series and applied in our study at annual values of pollutants air
   concentrations and mortality. An important objective of many
   environmental monitoring programs is to detect changes or trends in
   pollution levels over time. Over the period 1990-2005, concerning the
   emissions of main pollutants, we obtained significant decreasing trends.
   By considering the ozone mean values in urban areas over the 1997-2005
   period, an increase of 3.0\% year(-1) was obtained with annual averages
   and 3.9\% year(-1) with median values. A clear increasing trend for PM10
   ambient concentrations is obtained. In addition, we observed an increase
   of the Olea (and Grass) pollination season. Over the same period, an
   annual change rate of +0.31\% year(-1) for ``airway diseases{''} and of
   +2.50\% year(-1) for ``unknown causes{''} were identified in the ``Alpes
   Maritimes{''} county. To see the results, there seems to be a short-term
   link between the levels of these pollutants and mortality for
   respiratory causes. The other pollutants concentration showed a downward
   trend reflecting the reduction policy of the emissions. In addition, we
   obtained significant decreasing trends concerning the ``ischemic heart
   diseases{''} (-1.20\% year(-1)) and ``asthma{''} (-4.03\% year(-1))
   categories. No significant gender-related difference was identified for
   these groups. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Winter Active Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) Achieve High Foraging Rates
   in Urban Britain}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Foraging bumblebees are normally associated with spring and
   summer in northern Europe. However, there have been sightings of the
   bumblebee Bombus terrestris during the warmer winters in recent years in
   southern England. But what floral resources are they relying upon during
   winter and how much winter forage can they collect?
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To test if urban areas in the UK provide
   a rich foraging niche for bees we set up colonies of B. terrestris in
   the field during two late winter periods (2005/6 \& 2006/7) in London,
   UK, and measured their foraging performance. Fully automatic
   radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology was used in 2006/7 to
   enable us to record the complete foraging activity of individually
   tagged bees. The number of bumblebees present during winter (October
   2007 to March 2008) and the main plants they visited were also recorded
   during transect walks. Queens and workers were observed throughout the
   winter, suggesting a second generation of bee colonies active during the
   winter months. Mass flowering shrubs such as Mahonia spp. were
   identified as important food resources. The foraging experiments showed
   that bees active during the winter can attain nectar and pollen foraging
   rates that match, and even surpass, those recorded during summer.
   Conclusions/Significance: B. terrestris in the UK are now able to
   utilise a rich winter foraging resource in urban parks and gardens that
   might at present still be under-exploited, opening up the possibility of
   further changes in pollinator phenology.}},

   ragweed pollen grains (PG) differed significantly between Virovitica and
   Zagreb in both years, 2006. and 2007. In Virovitica it was significantly
   greater than in Zagreb. There was no statistically significant seasonal

Abstract = {{Background: Local aeroallergen surveys identify and establish patterns
   of prevalence for tree, grass, and weed species that enable the
   clinician to more effectively select allergens for skin testing and
   therapy.
   Objectives: To determine peak pollination periods, atmospheric
   concentrations, and year-to-year variation for identified tree, weed,
   and grass aeroallergens and examine the influence of selected
   meteorological parameters.
   Methods: Atmospheric sampling for pollen aeroallergens was performed
   using a volumetric rotating-arm impaction sampler. The Spearman
   correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between
   daily counts and selected meteorological parameters.
   Results: Previous findings for area trees, conducted at a different
   location, are corroborated. Predominant pollen types include Quercus,
   Cupressaceae, Pinaceae, Morus, Betulaceae, Acer, Platanus, Fraxinus,
   Poaceae, and Ambrosia. Early flowering weeds (Rumex and Typha) and
   Poaceae overlap with peak tree season in April. Biphasic seasons are
   noted for Poaceae and Ulmus. Tree pollen accounts for 91.2\%, weeds
   3.8\%, and grasses 3.2\% of total annual pollen yield. Variation in
   overall pollen production is evident from year to year. High production
   years for some species are low for others. Cyclic pollinating patterns
   for Alnus, Betulaceae, and Fagus were observed. Grass and weed pollen
   correlated positively with maximum temperature and dew point; however,
   the results for individual tree species were variable.
   Conclusion: The Washington, DC, metropolitan area is host to a variety
   of tree, weed, and grass species that produce copious amounts of pollen.
   Further investigation into year-to-year variation with respect to
   inherent cycling and meteorological influences is warranted. Ann Allergy

Abstract = {{Selective chemical insecticides have become the dominant approach for
   management of recalcitrant and resistant insect pests, and the prospects
   for use of these chemicals in combination with biocontrol agents are on
   the rise. These chemical compounds, when used in combination with an
   effective natural enemy, may provide more comprehensive prophylactic and
   remedial treatments in the context of an integrated pest management
   program (IPM) than either approach alone. Many of these compounds have
   promise for a diversity of applications, including sustainable
   agriculture, control of urban pests, and invasive species eradication.
   Unfortunately, there are only a limited number of studies in which the
   effect of these insecticides on natural enemies has been examined. In
   this article, we examine the risk of several classes of insecticidal
   compounds to non-target animals, particularly natural enemies and
   pollinators, and review the most promising compounds for combined
   deployment with biological agents. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Aim Morinda citrifolia L., commercially known as noni or the Indian
   mulberry plant, is morphologically variable and the only widely
   distributed member of the pantropical genus Morinda sensu stricto
   (Rubiaceae). This large distribution has been attributed partly to the
   ability of the seeds of the large-fruited M. citrifolia L. var.
   citrifolia L. to be transported by oceanic drifting. This form of M.
   citrifolia var. citrifolia has been predicted to be the progenitor
   colonizer of the island endemic Morinda species. Using a phylogenetic
   approach and large sampling of the widespread, large-fruited M.
   citrifolia var. citrifolia, we assessed the potential area of origin of
   M. citrifolia and tested the hypothesis that the large-fruited M.
   citrifolia var. citrifolia is an ancestral colonizer.
   Location Tropics.
   Methods We performed Bayesian analyses of 22 species of the tribe
   Morindeae (including 11 individuals of the three currently recognized
   varieties of M. citrifolia) based on combined nrETS, nrITS, rps16 and
   trnT-F sequence data. Geographic origins of the studied taxa were mapped
   onto the Bayesian majority rule consensus tree.
   Results Nine sequenced individuals of M. citrifolia from diverse
   geographic locations formed a highly supported clade, which was sister
   to the Australo-Micronesian clade that included M. bracteata var.
   celebica and M. latibracteata. These sister clades are part of the
   broader Asian, arborescent Morinda clade. We found no support for the
   current varietal classification of M. citrifolia.
   Main conclusions Our analyses suggest a Micronesian origin of M.
   citrifolia. This implies that the large-fruited M. citrifolia var.
   citrifolia might well have been present in the Pacific before the
   arrival of the Micronesian and Polynesian ancestors from Southeast Asia.
   The wide distribution of this form of M. citrifolia var. citrifolia is
   attributed partly to the trans-oceanic dispersal of its buoyant seeds,
   self-pollination and its ability to produce flowers and fruits
   year-round. The hypothesis that the widespread, large-fruited M.
   citrifolia var. citrifolia is the progenitor colonizer of the island
   endemic Morinda species is inconsistent with its derived position within
   the Asian, arborescent Morinda clade and with the fact that the nine
   sampled individuals of M. citrifolia form a clade.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic variation, the

   citriodora progenies in three different kinds of soils (Red Latossol,
   Quartz Sand and Purple Latossol), which occur in the Luiz Antonio
   Experimental Station, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The progeny test was
   established 1983, using 56 open-pollinated families of C. citriodora.
   Twenty five years after planting the following traits were measured:
   height, diameter at breast height (Dbh), stem form and survival. Best
   growth occurred in Purple Latossol. Significant differences among
   progenies were detected for most traits in all sites, suggesting the
   possibility of improvement by selection. In the analysis with sites,
   significant differences among locals, progenies and genotypes x soil
   interaction were detected, confirming that the tested material has
   sufficient genetic variation to be explored by selection in all sites.
   The analysis of genotype x soil interaction indicates that growth traits
   present single interaction and the same progenies can be selected in
   each site. On the order hand, genotype x soil interaction for stem form
   and survival was complex; and specific progenies need to be selected for
   each kind of soil. The population, due to its high genetic variation and
   strong genetic control of traits, permits to obtain considerable genetic
   gains by selection among and within progenies.}},

Abstract = {{The prolonged length of the juvenile period represents a substantial
   obstacle in olive (Olea europaea) breeding programs, delaying both the
   possibility for analyzing the fruit, the harvest unit, and the capacity
   for sexual recombination. In both olive and other fruit tree species,
   the juvenile-adult transition has been successfully hastened by forcing
   and formation procedures designed to rapidly achieve a minimum height.
   Precise knowledge of the position within the tree canopy where the
   juvenile-adult transition occurs, identified by the location of the
   first flowers, offers further potential for manipulating tree structure
   in order to hasten that transition. The occurrence of the juvenile-adult
   transition has been described spatially within the canopy as the
   formation of a juvenility cone, which we report here for olive plants
   from seed, and for the first time quantitatively describe its position
   based on the added trunk and branch distances from the soil. In canopies
   of seedlings from open pollination of cv. Arbequina olive the
   first-flowering position was consistently located. in our conditions, at
   an average distance of 200 cm from the trunk base. Based on that
   evidence, that first flowering can occur at lower positions, and on the
   values we obtained, three canopy-formation heights (100-130 cm, 130-160
   cm and >160 cm) were compared for their effect on the length of the
   juvenile period and the vigour of olive seedlings. Canopy heights of
   100-130 cm, much lower than the 160 cm previously reported by the olive
   tree breeding program of Cordoba, produced the highest number of
   flowering plants in the first two flowering years and also provided
   easier management. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   H. citrina (a nocturnally blooming species, pollinated by nocturnal
   hawkmoths) and observed their flowering behavior from blooming to
   closing with the use of digital cameras. For flower opening times, F1
   hybrids were highly variable, and F2 hybrids showed a bimodal
   distribution of flower opening times with peaks in both the morning and
   evening. The ratio of morning flowering and evening flowering among F2
   hybrids did not deviate from 1 : 1. For the start to close time, both F1
   and F2 hybrids were similar in showing the major peak in the evening.
   The ratio of evening closing and morning closing among F2 hybrids did
   not deviate from 3 : 1. These results suggest that the time of flower
   opening and the start of closing are regulated by different major genes.}},

   with small fruited spotted gum Corymbia citriodora subspecies variegata
   over a large portion of its range on the east coast of Australia. The
   two taxa are interfertile, have overlapping flowering times and share a
   common set of insect and vertebrate pollinators. Previous genetic
   analysis of both taxa from two geographically remote sites suggested
   that the two were morphotypes rather than genetically distinct species.
   In this study we further explore this hypothesis of genic species by
   expanding sampling broadly through their sympatric locations and examine
   local-scale spatial genetic structure in stands that differ in species
   and age composition. Delineation of populations at five microsatellite
   loci, using an individual-based approach and Bayesian modelling, as well
   as clustering of individuals based on allele frequencies showed the two
   species to be molecularly homogeneous. Genetic structure aligned largely
   with geographic areas of origin, and followed an isolation-by-distance
   model, where proximal populations were generally less differentiated
   than more distant ones. At the stand level, spotted gums also generally
   showed little structure consistent with the high levels of gene flow
   inferred across the species range. Disturbances in the uniformity of
   structuring were detected, however, and attributed to localised events
   giving rise to even aged stands, probably due to regeneration from a few
   individuals following fire.}},

   explain the types of flowering plants cultivated in Sindh, their
   flowering periods and the possibility of their pollen grains to induce
   IgE mediated hypersensitive reaction in people living in the selected

   species of plants that are being cultivated in the province of Sindh.
   These species are divided into two major groups: the first group
   includes allergenic pollen producing species, while the second group
   included 38 species that are known to be non-allergenic. Our results

Abstract = {{A novel melon cultivar ('Flavor No. T) containing high acid
   concentration as well as high sugar content in the mature fruit was
   successfully bred out. The aim of this study is to determine the main
   organic acids present in this novel melon and to clarify the mechanisms
   of acid accumulation. Fruit development and acid accumulation patterns
   in `Flavor No.3' were compared with those of a conventional low-acid
   melon, `Xuelihong'. The titratable acidity (TA) and organic acids in
   fruits were measured at different developmental stages. There is a
   positive correlation between TA and citric acid content in `Flavor No.
   T, indicating that citric acid is the predominant organic acid present
   throughout the fruit development. The activities of the enzymes involved
   in citric acid metabolism, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase
   (PEPC), citrate synthase (CS), aconitase (ACO), isocitrate dehydrogenase
   (IDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and malic enzyme (ME), were
   determined. Although no single enzyme was responsible for citric acid
   accumulation throughout the fruit development, the activities of ACO and
   ME were positively correlated with citric acid concentration in the two
   cultivars from 5 to 25 days after pollination (DAP). Moreover, ACO and
   ME activities in `Flavor No. 3' increased over time and were higher than
   those in `Xuelihong', resulting in citric acid accumulation in the
   fruits of `Flavor No. 3'. Although a sharp decrease in ACO activity took
   place after 25 DAP in the fruits of `Flavor No. T, the earlier
   accumulation of citric acid was sufficient enough to maintain the high
   acid concentration until the melon fruits became mature. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{We studied the diet of the Indian flying fox (Pteropus giganteus) in
   Pakistan from March 2008 to February 2009 and found that the bats fed on
   20 species belonging to 11 plant families. Of these, four families
   (Anacardiaceae, Bignonaceae, Malvaceae, and Sapotaceae) were identified
   from remnants of flower petals in food boluses while the remaining
   families (Annonaceae, Arecaceae, Ebenaceae, Meliaceae, Moraceae,
   Myrtaceae, and Sapindaceae) were identified from the seeds in the
   boluses and from guano samples. Plants in the family Moraceae (50.7\%)
   comprised most of the bat's diet. Fruit of Ficus retusa (27.5\%) and F
   carica (23.0\%) during winter, F glomerata (30.9\%) and F. religiosa
   (28.1\%) during spring, Psidium guajava (19.6\%), F. bengalensis
   (18.7\%) and Diospyros peregrina (17.8\%) during summer, and D.
   peregrina (71.9\%) during autumn, were the most frequently identified
   items. The four seasonal diets varied significantly (chi(2) = 435, d.f.
   = 18, P < 0.01). Results confirm that the ecological services rendered
   by P giganteus, such as pollination and seed dispersal, outweigh its
   losses, such as damage to the ripe fruit. Hence, the species should not
   be regarded as a pest; rather efforts should be made to ensure its
   conservation.}},

Title = {{Toxicity of Mimosa tenuiflora pollen to Africanized honey bees (Apis
   mellifera L.)}},
Journal = {{ACTA SCIENTIAE VETERINARIAE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{161-163}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mimosa tenuiflora (Willd.) Poir. (Mimosaceae) is a
   xerophilous plant which is very common in degraded areas in the
   Brazilian semi-arid region, including areas of beekeeping. The ingestion
   of leaves from M. tenuiflora by ruminants is responsible for
   malformations. Chemical analyses of this plant revealed that it contains
   several secondary compounds including three triterpenoidal saponins,
   designated Mimonosides A-C, four flavones, five flavanones and four
   chalcones. Several plant species contain secondary compounds in nectar
   and pollen that could be toxic to pollinators, including bees.
   Experimental approaches are necessary to identify plant species that
   produce pollen that is toxic to bees. The present study aimed to
   determine the toxic potential of M. tenuiflora (Willd.) Poir.
   (Mimosaceae) pollen to Africanized honey bees (Apis mellifera L.).
   Materials, Methods \& Results: The plant species utilized in this study
   was Mimosa tenuiflora (Willd.) Poir. (Mimosaceae) and a voucher specimen
   was deposited (no. 9591) at the Dardano de Andrade-Lima (MOSS)
   Herbarium, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arido (UFERSA), Mossoro,
   RN, Brazil. Pollen samples were collected near Mossoro city, RN, in
   northeastern Brazil (5 degrees 11'15{''}S and 37 degrees 20'39{''}W).
   Honeycombs that contained pupae of africanized honey bees (Apis
   mellifera) were collected from the apiary of UFERSA. Newly emerged
   forager bees, identified on basis of their body size and coloration,
   were used for the experiment. All the bees used were of the same age.
   Groups of twenty bees were put into wooden boxes (11 x 11 x 7 cm). The
   boxes were kept in an acclimatized chamber (BOD) at 32 degrees C and
   70\% humidity. M. tenuiflora pollen was added to the food (5 parts of
   sugar mixed to one part of honey) at doses of 0 (control group; n=195),
   2.5\% (n=178), 5.0\% (n=186) and 10.0\% (n=186). The bees were observed
   daily until the last one died. Statistical analyses were performed using
   a statistical software (GraphPad Prism v. 4 for Mac). Median survival
   times, with 95\% confidence intervals, were estimated using Kaplan-Meier
   survival analysis. Differences in the time distributions between groups
   were tested for statistical significance using the log-rank test. The
   median survival times of the bees were four days for all groups.
   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant difference
   (P=0.0041) between the survival curves, but the log-rank test did not
   show statistical difference (P=0.2825). The survival curve of controls
   differed (P=0.001) from the survival curve of the group fed 2.5\% M.
   tenuiflora, but did not differ from the other groups.
   Discussion: Several plant species contain secondary compounds in nectar
   and pollen that could be toxic to animals that consume them. Bees
   collect large amounts of pollen grains very efficiently, making these
   grains generally unavailable for pollination. Thus, presence of
   secondary compounds in pollen grains could be a strategy designed to
   restrict the loss of pollen to bees. Even though it contains several
   secondary metabolites, the results of the present study indicate that
   the ingestion of the pollen of Mimosa tenuiflora by Africanized honey
   bees (Apis mellifera L.) at conditions of the present study did not
   promote toxic effect.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},

Abstract = {{The atmospheric pollen loads of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, were
   monitored between September 2007 and July 2009. To examine the match of
   the airborne pollen composition with the flowering duration of their
   contributing plants, the phenology of native and non-native plants in
   various habitats near the pollen-trapping site was undertaken between
   August 2008 and July 2009. The pollen load was found to have a strong
   seasonal component associated with the start of spring in September.
   This is incongruent with the peak flowering season of the total taxa in
   October. In most taxa, atmospheric pollen signatures appeared before
   flowering was observed in the field. The presence of most pollen types
   in the atmosphere also exceeded the observed flowering duration of
   potential pollen-source taxa. Reasons for this may be related to the
   sampling effort of phenological monitoring, pollen blown in from earlier
   flowering populations outside of the sampling area, the ability of
   pollen to be reworked, and the large pollen production of some
   wind-pollinated taxa. In 2007-2008, 15 pollen types dominated the
   atmosphere, accounting for 90\% of the airborne pollen load. The top six
   pollen types belonged to Betula, Cupressaceae, Myrtaceae, Salix, Poaceae
   and Ulmus. Comparatively, the annual pollen load of Hobart is lower than
   in most other Australian cities; however, the pollen signal of Betula is
   inordinately high. Native plants play a minor role as pollen
   contributors, despite the proximity of native habitats to the
   pollen-sampling location. The implications of the aerobiological
   observations are discussed in relation to public health.}},

Abstract = {{A steady stream of ecosystem services is essential for human welfare and
   survival, and it has been convincingly shown that these flows are being
   eroded. Compelling theoretical knowledge about essential connections
   between ecosystem service generation, biodiversity, and resilience in
   social-ecological systems already exists; however, we still, to a great
   extent, lack spatially explicit quantitative assessments for translating
   this theoretical knowledge into practice. We propose an approach for
   measuring the change in flow and resilience of a regulating ecosystem
   service on a landscape scale over time when the landscape is exposed to
   both land use change due to urban expansion, and change in a large-scale
   economic driver. Our results quantitatively show that there can be a
   substantial decrease in resilience due to negative effects on response
   diversity without detecting any major decrease in ecosystem service
   generation over time, thus generating a sense of false security and
   sustainability.}},

Pages = {{61-67}},
Abstract = {{Insect pollination is an ecosystem service with high economic value that
   is mainly provided by bees. However, feral bees and managed honeybees
   are threatened globally by several anthropogenic factors such as changes
   in agricultural practices, loss of unimproved grasslands, urbanization,
   and spread of pathogens. These factors have led to the extinction of
   many native bees, to a reduction in the number of managed honeybee
   colonies, and put the nutritional bases for bees at risk. Chronic
   exposure to insecticides, even when they are appropriately used, may
   affect the foraging behavior of honeybees, which in turn weakens a
   colony and makes it more susceptible for diseases. Honeybees suffer from
   parasites like the Varroa mite, and from several viral and bacterial
   pathogens, which need to be controlled with great efforts. Climate
   changes represent future threats that will probably impact native bee
   populations as well as apicultural practices. Coordinated actions are
   needed to prevent the global loss of large pollinator populations.
   Especially the maintenance of plant and bee diversity is very important
   - as well as basic research on the causes for honeybee colony losses.
   Together, policy, science, and economy should have a crucial interest in
   conserving the global pollination service of bees.}},

Abstract = {{In order to increase biodiversity in the urban environment, several
   wildflower species were tested in terms of attractiveness towards
   pollinators. The species were selected on the basis of their mutualistic
   relation with pollinators, in terms of pollination biology. Plants with
   very showy flowers, like those belonging to the botanical families of
   Amaryllidaceae, Dipsacacee, Malvacee, Campanulacee, Asteraceae,
   Apiaceae, Ranunculaceae, Lamiaceae, Caryophyllaceae and Campanulaceae,
   were selected, grown in pots and tested in the urban environment to
   explore their potentiality to attract pollinators (bees, bumblebees,
   diptera and butterflies) in spite of the typically adverse life
   conditions of the urban environment. During the spring and summer months
   of the period 2006-2007, some observations were made on both wildflowers
   grown in the city and spontaneous plants of the same species in the
   natural environments, where the seeds of the studied species used were
   collected. The urban ecosystem tends to heavily limit the presence of
   pollinators, especially regard to the categories of butterflies and
   bumblebees, while solitary bees and diptera (especially Bombyliidae and
   Syrphydae) were more stable. In conclusion, in order to make the
   dynamics of wildflowers' survival sustainable over time, it is necessary
   to make pollinators' life possible in the city through the creation of
   environments for their breeding and of ecological corridors that can
   facilitate their entry into urban ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{In sink tissues of cucurbits, including watermelon fruits, stachyose and
   raffinose together with sucrose are the major translocated
   carbohydrates. The metabolism of imported carbohydrates in fruit is
   related to the fruit sink strength. To shed light on the relationship
   between carbohydrates metabolism with fruit set of watermelon (Citrullus
   Lanatus Mansfeld), changes in carbohydrates and carbohydrate
   metabolizing enzymes in the non-pollinated, pollinated and both
   pollinated and regulator (Zuogualing) treated ovary were studied from 0
   to 6 days after anthesis with cultivar `Jingxin 1'. Analysis for sugar
   content revealed that fructose and glucose were the major soluble sugar
   in watermelon ovary. In the pollinated ovary, dry matter and
   concentrations of fructose and glucose increased rapidly. In accordance
   with this, activities of acid and alkaline alpha-galactosidase, acid
   invertase (AI) and natural invertase (NI) increased after anthesis and
   remained higher level. In the ovary both pollinated and Zuogualing
   treated, activities of acid and alkaline alpha-galactosidase, AI and NI
   were significantly higher than the ovary pollinated only and the
   increase of dry matter, fructose and glucose was also accelerated. While
   in the non-pollinated ovary which became yellow gradually and aborted,
   there was no increase of dry matter, concentrations of soluble sugar
   showed a decreased trend, and activities of all the enzymes studied
   declined sharply. These results suggested that fast increase of fructose
   and glucose was crucial to watermelon ovary development and fruit set.
   alpha-Galactosidase, AI and NI played an important role in regulating
   accumulation of fructose and glucose during the period of fruit set.}},

   Polyploids, especially triploids, had higher levels of lycopene than

   than tetraploids. While levels of citrulline were low and more variable,
   levels tended to be higher in polyploids than diploids, with triploids

   rapidly, reaching a maximum value at 37 DAP in tetraploid fruit and 34
   DAP in triploid and diploid fruit. The maximum lycopene value of diploid
   fruit was lower than that of either polyploid fruit. The Lycopene
   content decreased slightly in over-mature fruit. The maximum citrulline
   value occurred in fruit that was near maturity. The citrulline content

Abstract = {{Sugar accumulation, the key process determining fruit quality, is
   controlled by both the translocation of sugars and their metabolism in
   developing fruits. Sugar composition in watermelon, as in all cucurbit
   fruits, includes sucrose, fructose and glucose. The proportions of these
   three sugars are determined primarily by three enzyme families:
   invertases, sucrose synthases (SuSys) and sucrose phosphate synthases
   (SPSs). The goal of the present research was to explore the process of
   sugar metabolism in watermelon fruits. Crosses between the domestic
   watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) and three wild species provided a wide
   germplasm to explore genetic variability in sugar composition and
   metabolism. This survey demonstrated great genetic variability in sugar
   content and in the proportions of sucrose, glucose and fructose in
   mature fruits. Genotypes accumulating high and low percentage of sucrose
   provided an experimental system to study sugar metabolism in developing
   fruits. Insoluble invertase activity was high and constant throughout
   fruit development in control lines and in genotypes accumulating low
   levels of sucrose, while in genotypes accumulating high levels of
   sucrose, activity declined sharply 4 weeks after pollination. Soluble
   acid invertase activity was significantly lower in genotypes
   accumulating high levels of sucrose than in low-sucrose-accumulating
   genotypes. Conversely, activities of SuSy and SPS were higher in the
   high-sucrose-accumulating genotypes. The present results establish that,
   within the genus Citrullus, there are genotypes that accumulate a high
   percentage of sucrose in the fruit, while others accumulate high
   percentages of glucose and fructose. The significant negative
   correlation between insoluble invertase activity and fruit sucrose level
   suggests that sucrose accumulation is affected by both phloem unloading
   and sugar metabolism. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescent banding patterns of pear chromosomes were determined from
   samples taken from root tips of open-pollinated seedlings of six
   cultivars from three species {[}Pyrus pyrifolia (Burm. F) Nakai
   (Japanese pear), P. communis L. (European pear), and A bretschneideri
   Rehder (Chinese pear)]. Root tips were pretreated in 2 mM
   8-hydroxyquinoline at 10 degrees C for 4 h; the chromosome samples were
   prepared by the enzymatic maceration and air-drying method. All
   cultivars used in this study had 2n=34 chromosomes. Chromomycin A(3)
   (CMA) positive (+) bands were observed in telomeric positions of four
   chromosomes. In some samples, these CMA + bands were observed at
   satellite positions. 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) negative bands
   (-) were seen to correspond with CMA + bands. Thirty chromosomes had no
   CMA +/DAPI - bands. No propidium iodide (PI) bands were observed in any
   chromosomes. The number and positions of CMA + bands were stable, and
   there was no difference among the three species.}},

Pages = {{1-5}},
Abstract = {{We outline the scope of this special issue of New Zealand Journal of
   Ecology, which reviews progress in New Zealand ecology to 2009, based on
   a symposium in 2007. Both the issue and symposium update a 1986
   conference and 1989 special issue of NZ J Ecol called ``Moas, Mammals
   and Climate{''} which has been influential and widely cited. This issue
   revisits several themes featured in 1989, including the extent of recent
   and prehistoric extinctions in the New Zealand fauna; effects of
   introduced mammalian herbivores replacing now-extinct browsing birds
   such as moa; the impacts of introduced mammalian predators on native
   birds (hence the Feathers to Fur title); the role of islands as refuges
   and opportunities for restoration; and the status of bird-plant
   mutualisms like pollination and fruit dispersal. Several topics not
   discussed in 1989 are raised, including the unusual size and functional
   composition of New Zealand's tree flora, and several taxonomic groups
   (invertebrates, fungi) and habitats (fresh waters) that received little
   attention in 1989. We summarise four symposium talks which are not
   included elsewhere in this issue. New Zealand leads the world in ways
   both unenviable (e.g. levels of impact of introduced species) and
   enviable (e.g. predator eradication, translocations, rare species
   management). The recent advances reviewed in this issues have relevance
   well beyond New Zealand.}},

Title = {{Reproductive success and pollen dispersal in urban populations of an

Journal = {{PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{21-29}},
Abstract = {{Urban development increasingly occupies more landscape and is
   responsible for habitat alteration and fragmentation of so many
   ecosystems that urban environments can no longer be excluded from the
   areas to be considered in conservation strategies. Appropriate
   management measures ensuring population viability are needed, but due to
   the usually irreversible feature of the urbanisation process, the
   measure; may differ from non-urbanised areas. Sufficient gene flow
   levels, leading to successful seed production, appear to be a key
   element in the sustainable persistence of insect-pollinated plant
   remnant populations. This study investigated reproductive success and
   pollen dispersal patterns in Centaurea jacea, an insect-pollinated
   hay-meadow herb, in the Brussels urban area (Belgium). Reproductive
   performance of urban park populations was compared with populations
   occurring in urban semi-natural sites. Pollen dispersal patterns were
   examined within and among-population patches front two urban parks using
   fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Urban park populations showed a
   higher reproductive success than those in urban semi-natural sites.
   Depositions of fluorescent dye particles on recipient individuals were
   found within populations (< 20 m), among populations within parks (over
   a few hundred meters) and among parks (maximal investigated distance:
   2.6 km), indicating pollinator movements and a potential gene flow by
   pollen over relatively long distances. Dye dispersal showed an
   exponential decay distribution with respect to spatial distance. The
   very small populations received more immigrant dye deposition when
   located at short distances from the source population. These findings
   demonstrate that urban populations do not perform worse in reproductive
   success than populations from agricultural landscapes, despite their
   small size, and can function as a network exchanging pollen. The
   conversion of urban park lawns into interconnected networks of
   ecologically managed hay meadows, allowing simultaneous flowering and
   seed production in many patches of target species, is to be strongly
   encouraged. (c) 2009 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Does floral trait variability enhance reproductive success in deceptive
   orchids?}},
Journal = {{PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{317-322}},
Abstract = {{Unusually high intra-specific floral trait variability has often been
   described within deceptive orchid populations, as opposed to rewarding
   ones. Such variability is traditionally thought to have consequences on
   reproduction in this orchid group, i.e. phenotypically variable
   deceptive Species may have a reproductive success advantage compared to
   those with a constant floral display. The proposed reason for this
   hypothetic pattern is that floral trait variability decreases pollinator
   avoidance learning in dealing with nectarless flowers, hence increasing
   their visitation rate. However, despite an intuitive and appealing
   hypothesis and a possible mechanism to explain it, the often-cited
   higher reproductive success induced by floral trait variability still
   remains unsupported.
   Here, we review the literature and consider eight studies that have
   experimentally or correlatively tested this hypothesis in deceptive
   orchids. In all these experiments, we have found no difference in
   average reproductive success between populations with high versus low
   flower trait variability, either in scent variable or colour polymorphic
   species. We discuss possible explanations for the lack of this pattern
   including the incapability of pollinators in perceiving the variability,
   the scarce relevance of polymorphic traits in the choice of species to
   forage on, or a different pollinator behaviour than the one proposed. We
   suggest that the high phenotypic variability is not likely to enhance
   deceptive orchids' reproductive success, but is more likely to be a
   consequence of relaxed selection by pollinators. Nonetheless,
   information regarding orchid pollination strategy or pollinator
   cognitive abilities is often superficial, hence calling researchers for
   additional investigations that can contribute to a better understanding
   of this debated and yet unsupported hypothesis. (C) 2010 Perspectives in

Booktitle = {{POLLEN: STRUCTURE, TYPES AND EFFECTS}},
Series = {{Environmental Science Engineering and Technology}},
Year = {{2010}},
Pages = {{289-304}},
Abstract = {{Orbicules or Ubisch bodies are corpuscles of sporopollenin that appear
   in the anther locule during pollen grain development Their size ranges
   from 0.14 mu m to 20 mu m They present different shapes with a smooth or
   ornamented surface. Orbicules often form aggregates and sometimes have a
   plaque-like appearance. Ultrastructurally, they may present a central
   core with different degree of transparency to electrons. Those that do
   not have a central core are observed completely solid Orbicules are
   resistant to acetolisis, autofluorescent when irradiated with
   ultraviolet light and have the same reaction to colorants that the exine
   of pollen grains. Their presence is generally associated with a tapetal
   membrane in species with secretor type tapetum and with a peritapetal
   membrane in species with intermediate or plasmodial type tapetum.
   Although the shed of orbicules out of the anther along with the pollen
   grains is cited, they are usually attached to the inner surface of the
   locule when the anther opens.
   Investigations suggest that orbicules appear in approximately 80
   families of Angiosperms and Gimnosperms. It is not certain whether
   orbicules are not developed in the rests of the families or are just not
   informed. Researches on ontogeny and ultrastructure of orbicules are
   rare However, their tapetal origin and their simultaneous formation with
   the pollen grain wall are well established. The systematic value of
   orbicules is known and considered in a few families, such as
   Loganiaceae, Gentianaceae, Apocynaceae, Rubiaceae and Oxalidaceae.
   Evolutionary studies on these bodies or on its relationship with the
   different modes of pollination are lacking. Even though orbicules are so
   common among angiosperms, their function is unknown and only
   speculations are made On this report a review on orbicules is made and
   an analysis of their presence, ontogeny and morphology is presented. Our
   aim is to supply information that will help understand orbicules
   function. Therefore, the orbicules morphology in relation with the
   pollination mode is studied.}},

Journal = {{SILVAE GENETICA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{233-241}},
Abstract = {{Inter-specific Corymbia hybrids are of increasing interest to plantation
   forestry, yet there is little knowledge of the most suitable controlled
   pollination methods for this genus. Inter-specific crosses were made
   between C. torelliana {[}CT(maternal parent)] and C. citriodora subsp.
   variegata (CCV), C. henryi (CH) and C. citriodora subsp. citriodora
   (CCC) using conventional pollination, one-stop pollination (OSP) and
   artificially-induced protogyny on yellow buds (AIP Y) pollination
   methods. Additional treatments included AIP on green buds (AIP G) and
   the use of exclusion bags for the OSP and AIP methods. Inter-specific
   hybrids (CT x CCV, CT x CH and CT x CCC) were successfully created using
   all three pollination methods. The AIP Y treatment provided the highest
   seed yields and achieved time savings of >41\% over the conventional and
   OSP methods, resulting in up to five-fold increases in operator
   productivity. However, the AIP Y treatment also had the highest C.
   torelliana contamination levels (9.3-13.2\%). The use of exclusion bags
   with the AIP method had minimal effect on contamination rates,
   indicating a high proportion of self-pollen contamination. Contamination
   rates varied between maternal parents, suggesting variation in
   self-compatibility for C. torelliana individuals. AIP using semi-ripe
   green buds was not effective at reducing selfing and had low operator
   productivity. The AIP method is suitable for use in a large-scale hybrid
   breeding program for C. torelliana. When self-pollination effects are
   managed, it could greatly reduce the costs associated with the
   production of seed of elite family crosses for commercial forestry
   deployment.}},

Abstract = {{Resource availability is an important predictor of abundance and species

   diversity testing the hypothesis that bee species richness and abundance
   will increase with increasing resource availability. Resource
   availability was considered here as the number of flowering plants and
   the number of plant species. Sampling was carried out at two sites in
   Brazil, the quartzitic range (Ouro Branco) and metaliferous fields (Ouro
   Preto). At these sites ecosystems are endangered by high anthropogenic
   impacts, particularly due to mining and urbanization. The samples were
   collected for 10 months in each site, twice a month, from 8:00 am to
   5:00 pm. The bees belonged to 77 species and 5 subfamilies. Bee species
   and abundance increased with the increase in the number of plant species
   and plant abundance at both sites. Bee richness and abundance were
   higher in Ouro Branco than in Ouro Preto. Our results showed that bee
   diversity may be regulated by resource availability.}},

   and Nannotrigona testaceicornis (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are responsible
   for the pollination of plants in natural ecosystems and agroecosystems.
   Increased organic agriculture has intensified the use of botanical
   insecticides by farmers. However, there are no studies on the impact of
   these substances on social bees. Therefore, the present work aimed at
   evaluating the impacts of the botanical insecticides rotenone, andiroba
   oil, garlic extract, neem oil, citronella oil and eucalyptus oil on N.
   testaceicornis and T angustula. Bioassays on toxicity and the evaluation
   of the impact of the insecticides on the handling behavior of adult bees
   were carried out. The insecticide most toxic to adults of T angustula
   was citronella oil. None of the botanical insecticides studied presented
   toxicity to N testaceicornis. The botanical insecticides did not affect
   the handling behavior of the bees. Our results provide important
   information for the management of pests, aiming to preserve pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{The poor fructification is a serious problem of pear production in
   Brazil. The lack of fertilization, especially during blooming time,
   result in a poor fruit set and in a low yield of the orchard. When the
   pollination is poor, it is necessary to use bioregulators. The goals of
   the present study was to evaluate the effect of different products on
   fruit set of Red Bartlett (Pyrus communis L.) pears. The experiment was
   conducted in Sao Joaquim city (28 degrees 17'S, 49 degrees 56'W), Santa
   Catarina State. The experimental design was a randomized block design.
   The rate of fruit set was determined two months after the application of
   the products. The treatments were: 1 - Control (water); 2 - Boron (2000
   mg L-1) + Kymon Plus (R) 2 ml L-1 (N - 9\%, K - 3\%, amino acids),
   applied at the beginning, full and end of the bloom; 3 - GA(3) (30 mg
   L-1) at full bloom; 4 - ANA (3.4 ml ha(-1)) + Prohexadione-Ca (500 mg
   L-1) at the beginning of the bloom + Promalin (R) (0.3 ml L-1) applied
   at the beginning and the end of the petals fall; 5 - Prohexadione-Ca
   (2500 mg L-1) at the petals fall; 6 Prohexadione-Ca (5000 mg L-1) at the
   petals fall; 7 - Promalin (R) (0.3 mg L-1) at full bloom; 8 - Promalin
   (R) (1 mg L-1) at full bloom; 9 - Retain (R) (4000 mg L-1) 15 days after
   the full bloom; 10 - GA(3) (40 mg L-1) + Paclobutrazol (0.2 mg L-1) at
   full bloom. The best results on fruit set were obtained with the
   following treatments 8 Promalin (1 mg L-1), 7 - Promalin (0.3 mg L-1)

Abstract = {{Insects provide essential ecological services in both the natural
   environment and in human-dominated habitats. Because pollinator declines
   associated with land use change have been reported across the globe,
   there is great concern that pollinators and the ecosystem services they
   provide will be negatively affected. This study examines the diversity
   and abundance of bee pollinators in grasslands in Boulder County,
   Colorado, USA. Over five years, 5,200 bees were collected in grassland
   plots with different levels of urbanization. Most of the difference in
   species composition among three levels of urbanization was due to rare
   species that may not have been discovered in all plots. Neither the
   number of species nor their abundance differed significantly among the
   plot types, although the trend indicated increasing diversity with
   increasing distance from urbanization. Most notably, measures of
   urbanization, such as the amount of pavement and development, were not
   correlated with diversity. The most important factor affecting bee
   abundance, particularly for ground-nesting bees, was grazing regime. Bee
   abundance also was positively related to the number of flowering plant
   species. Other studies of different insects (grasshoppers and
   butterflies) in these plots showed results similar to ours. In contrast,
   previous studies on song-birds, raptors, and rodents showed significant
   differences between urban edge and remote plots in terms of organism
   abundance and diversity. Together, these results suggest that factors
   other than the degree of urbanization are important in determining
   insect abundance and diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Ploidy manipulation in Citrus is a major issue of current breeding
   programs aiming to develop triploid seedless mandarins to address
   consumer demands for seedless fruits. The most effective method to

   cultivars with pollen of diploid varieties. Such non apomictic
   tetraploid lines are not found in the citrus germplasm and need to be
   created. In this work we describe a new methodology based on in vitro
   shoot-tip grafting combined with treatment of the micro-grafted
   shoot-tip with colchicine and oryzalin to achieve chromosome doubling
   and a dechimerization procedure assisted by flow cytometry. Stable
   tetraploid plants of Clemenules, Fina and Marisol clementines and
   Moncada mandarin have been obtained directly from shoot tip grafting
   combined with colchicine and oryzalin treatments or after
   dechimerization of mixoploids plants (2x-4x). These stable tetraploid
   plants have been used in 4x x 2x hybridizations, to recover over 3,250

Abstract = {{An efficient protocol for in vitro maturation of very immature, <10 mm,
   avocado embryos has been developed. The efficiency of plant recovery as
   well as the quality of the resulting plants was greatly improved by
   including a maturation phase prior to induction of germination. The
   influence of different factors, such as the gelling agent, organic
   supplements or abscisic acid, on embryo maturation and subsequent
   germination was tested. Optimum conditions were met when maturation was
   carried out in B5m medium supplemented with the Jensen's amino acids, an
   extra 88 mM sucrose and 6 g 1(-1) agar as gelling agent. At these
   conditions, embryos which had been collected 68 days after pollination
   germinated at a 65\% rate in solid medium, giving rise to healthy and
   vigorous plantlets. Anatomical differentiation and storage product
   accumulation occurring during the in vitro maturation phase were studied
   by means of histological techniques. Results obtained revealed that, at
   the end of the in vitro maturation period, embryos resembled the pattern
   previously established for avocado embryos matured under in vivo
   conditions: histodifferentiation had been accomplished and starch
   granules and protein bodies were abundant. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{805-820}},

Abstract = {{The potential for seed-eating birds to spread viable seeds was
   investigated using captive-feeding trials to determine seed preference,
   passage time through the gut, and viability of passed seeds for
   bronzewing pigeons (Phaps chalcoptera), peaceful doves (Geopelia
   striata), crested pigeons (Ocyphaps lophotes), Senegal doves
   (Streptopelia senegalensis), zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), black
   ducks (Anas superciliosa) and wood ducks (Chenonetta jubata). Test seeds
   were bladder clover (Trifolium spumosum), crimson clover (Trifolium
   incarnatum), gorse (Ulex europaeus), canola (Brassica napus) and red
   panicum (Setaria italica). Their consumption was compared with that of
   commercial seed mixes. Although all test seeds were recognizable foods,
   their consumption usually decreased in the presence of other foods,
   except for canola, where consumption rates were maintained. Hard-seeded
   bladder clover was the only species where viable seeds were passed by
   obligate seedeaters. In contrast, viable seeds of canola and gorse were
   passed by seed-eating omnivorous/herbivorous ducks, although the
   germination of passed seeds (42\%) was reduced significantly compared
   with that of untreated control seed (67\%). Field validation with wild,
   urban bronzewings and Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) offered
   canola and commercial seed yielded similar outcomes, with a range of
   viable seeds recovered from magpie soft pellets. Mean seed passage time
   in captive birds ranged from 0.5 to 4.3 h for all test seeds and
   commercial seed mixes, suggesting that these bird species may
   potentially disperse seed over moderate distances. Despite the low
   probability of individual birds spreading viable seed, the high number
   of birds feeding in the wild suggests that the potential for granivorous
   and seed-eating omnivorous birds to disperse viable seeds cannot be
   discounted, particularly if exozoochorous dispersal is also considered.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation may affect the reproductive success of plant
   populations in many different ways. Thus, negative, neutral, or positive
   plant responses can be observed, according to the balance of the
   different interactions. Variables related to mutualistic and
   antagonistic interactions (pollinator activity and gall occurrence,
   respectively) were measured on Byrsonima sericea populations of a
   fragmented seashore area (restinga) in southeastern Brazil. Pollinator
   visits to the oil-bearing flowers, insect gall occurrence on stems and
   inflorescences, and fruit set of B. sericea were compared between three
   small (up to 0.3 ha) and three large (14.0-99.0 ha) fragments. MANOVA
   showed differences between fragment classes. Nevertheless, a posteriori
   univariate ANOVA showed that the pollinator visit frequency was more
   than twofold higher in small fragments, and that gall occurrence and
   fruit set did not show significant differences between small and large
   fragments. These results suggest that the habitat fragmentation does not
   affect the female reproductive success of B. sericea in the studied
   restinga areas because resource availability seems to be a more
   important factor for fruit set than pollen limitation due to pollination
   failure. This is the first work assessing the effects of habitat
   fragmentation in restinga areas, which are intensely impacted by
   urbanization, so that no generalization about the fragmentation
   consequences can still be made for this ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Seedlessness is an important trait in the evaluation of commercial
   mandarin for fresh consumption. However, in the last decade, the
   presence of seeds in fruit of cultivars considered as seedless has
   become a problem in different citrus-growing areas because the
   commercial value is depreciated. Seeds have appeared concomitantly with
   the introduction of new cultivars that appear to be cross-compatible. To
   overcome this problem, different strategies have been explored, but a
   definitive answer is still elusive. The search for alternatives
   contrasts with how little is known about the basis of the problem: the
   pollen-pistil incompatibility reaction in mandarin, and the
   intercompatibility relationship between different cultivars. In this
   work, we characterized the pollen-pistil incompatibility in the two
   commonly grown mandarin cultivars Fortune and Nova, and evaluated the
   intercompatibility relationship between six cultivars with different
   genetic origins; these cultivars included Fortune (Citrus clementina
   Hort. ex Tan. x Citrus reticulate Blanco), Nova {[}(Citrus paradisi
   Macf. x C. reticulate) x C. clementina), Comune Clementine (C.
   clementina), Avana apireno (C. reticulate), Primosole (Citrus unshiu
   Marcov. x C reticulate), and Simeto (C. unshiu x Citrus deliciosa Ten.).
   Following the controlled hand pollination in the field, we evaluated
   pollen tube performance after self- and cross-pollination, as well as
   intercultivar compatibility by observing pollen tube growth. The results
   show the self-incompatibility of these cultivars with the pollen tube
   having been arrested in the style, which explains their seedless
   condition when planted in solid blocks. The study of intercompatibility
   indicates a different pollen tube behavior depending on the genotype, as
   well as on the cross combinations. These results provide a basis to
   evaluate self- and intercompatibility in citrus, and the effect of close
   planting of some cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{Birds are usually considered beneficial partners for plants, acting as
   predators on herbivorous insects, pollinators and seed dispersal agents.
   However, in an urban area of central Japan, birds break off large
   quantities of live camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora) twigs in winter.
   This loss of vegetative parts was examined quantitatively to estimate
   the impact on the trees. I also observed bird foraging behaviour to
   determine the species involved and the possible reasons underlying this
   destructive activity. Broken twigs on the forest floor were found to
   have numerous leaves and spring buds. The densities of leaves and buds
   in the litter were 288.5 and 54.4 m-2, respectively. The jungle crow
   (Corvus macrorhynchos) may have broken off the twigs either to peck the
   fruits while perching on stable branches, or possibly to remove twigs
   obstructing access to fruit. In contrast, brown-eared bulbuls
   (Hypsipetes amaurotis), oriental turtle doves (Streptopelia orientalis)
   and rove doves (Columba livia) ate fruits without breaking twigs. The
   interaction between C. camphora and C. macrorhynchos only extends back
   for about 20 years in urban Japan, indicating that this is unlikely to
   be a stable, co-evolved relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Literature review of the dispersal of transgenes from genetically
   modified maize. This article aims at reviewing the theoretical, and
   experimental data published in 562 publications referring to genetically
   modified (GM) maize dispersal. Our choice was limited to this since in
   the European Union (EU), GM maize is the only GM crop currently grown
   commercially The pollen dispersal of transgenic maize is due to two
   factors (i) pollen-mediated gene flow;. (ii) seed admixture during
   harvest and post-harvest processes. The pollen dispersal decreases
   rapidly with the distance from CM plots. Climatic and topographic
   factors and factors of relative density between GM and non-GM maize
   plots impact on the pollen dispersal The combination of both isolation
   distance and flowering, date between source plots and sink plots limits
   the adventitious presence of transgenes in non-GM plots. All
   publications; we reviewed demonstrate that the EU 0.9\% threshold is
   technically manageable if the measures of isolation distance as well as
   harvesting and post harvesting processes and Fully synchronous flowering
   are implemented To cite this article: A. Ricroch et al., C R. Biologies

Abstract = {{The reproductive characteristics of `Nishiuchi Konatsu', a bud mutation
   of Hyuganatsu that is self-incompatible, were examined. A pollination
   experiment resulted in Hyuganatsu x `Nishiuchi Konatsu' and `Nishiuchi
   Konatsu' self-pollination produced their fruit, whereas `Nishiuchi
   Konatsu' x Hyuganatsu cannot produce fruit as a result of early dropping
   of premature fruits within the first 10 weeks after pollination,
   Considering the self-incompatible nature of Hyuganatsu, this result
   implies a mutation of the pollen-expressed gene(s) associated with the
   self-incompatibility occurring in `Nishiuchi Konatsu'. When `Nishiuchi
   Konatsu' pollen was used for several citrus accessions (Hyuganatsu,
   `Nishiuchi Konatsu', Hassaku, and `Sweet Spring'), it was observed that
   the number of normal seeds decreased and that of aborted seeds
   increased. Interestingly, the extent of seed abortion differed among
   seed parents. Hyuganatsu and `Nishiuchi Konatsu' lost most of their
   normal seeds. In contrast, Hassaku lost relatively lesser seeds, and
   `Sweet Spring' lost only a few seeds. Moreover, Hassaku fruits obtained
   by pollination with `Nishiuchi Konatsu' pollen showed various
   proportions of normal and aborted seeds even among individual fruits.
   `Nishiuchi Konatsu' pollen did not affect the fruit characteristics,
   with some exceptions in Hyuganatsu, `Nishiuchi Konatsu', and Hassaku.
   All the characteristics were superior in Hyuganatsu-pollinated fruits
   compared with `Nishiuchi Konatsu'-pollinated ones in `Sweet Spring'. In
   conclusion, it was demonstrated that `Nishiuchi Konatsu' has two
   agriculturally important traits: self-compatibility and seed abortion.
   It can be useful for elucidating the mechanisms and as the genetic
   resources that introduce these traits.}},

Abstract = {{Species with mixed mating systems often demonstrate variable expression
   of breeding system characteristics and thus represent the opportunity to
   understand the factors and mechanisms that promote both outcrossed and
   selfed seed production. Here, we investigate variation in levels of
   herkogamy (variation in stigma-anther separation distance) in a Puerto
   Rican population of hummingbird pollinated Gesneria citrina Urban. There
   is significant variation in herkogamy levels among individuals of this
   species and stigma-anther separation is negatively associated with the
   ability to set fruits and seeds in the absence of pollinators. The
   variation in levels of herkogamy may represent a mechanism to ensure the
   production of some self-fertilized progeny in the absence of hummingbird
   pollinators. We also describe a novel breeding system in G. citrina,
   where stamens elongate over time to reach stigma height, but stamen
   elongation is accelerated by pollination. These results suggest that
   once the flowers are pollinated, stamen elongation may favor increased
   pollen removal and siring success, while the reduction in stigma-anther
   distance no longer imposes the risk of interference between male and
   female functions. We discuss our findings of breeding system variation
   in the context of pollination system evolution in an island setting

Abstract = {{We transformed the European pear (Pyrus communis L.) `La France' and
   `Ballade' with the Citrus FLOWERING LOCUS T (CiFT) gene, which induces
   early flowering. Subsequent DNA blot analysis of the transformed and
   wild-type plants indicated that the transformed plants carried 1-4
   copies of CiFT. Of the 8 transformed `La France' and 7 transgenic
   `Ballade' plant lines obtained, 7 and 5 lines respectively, flowered
   early when cultivated in vitro in a micropropagation medium. No
   correlation was found between the OFT copy number and early flowering in
   vitro, however, the results of RNA gel blot analysis indicated a strong
   correlation between the expression of the CiFT gene and floral bud
   differentiation ill vitro. Flowers that developed ill vitro differed
   from wild-type flowers in terms of phenotypic traits, such as the number
   of pistils, petals, sepals, and stamens. To investigate the inheritance
   pattern of the CiFT gene, we obtained 15 seeds from the fruits of P.
   communis L. `Bartlett' plants that were cross-pollinated with transgenic
   line No. 6, which had the second highest expression of the transgene. Of
   7 seedlings that expressed the CiFT gene, 5 flowered within 10 months
   after they were transferred to a green house. This result indicated that
   the CiFT gene induced early flowering in the transformed pear plants and
   that their progeny inherited the early flowering phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{`Orri', a selection of `Orha' mandarin {[}Temple (Citrus temple hort. ex
   Y. Tanaka) x Dancy (Citrus tangerina hort. ex Tanaka)], is a new
   high-quality Israeli mandarin which, in the last decade, has become one
   of the leading varieties in Israel. `Orri' has an excellent taste, the
   rind is deep orange in color and easily removed, and it contains few or
   no seeds. However, `Orri' grown in Israel suffers from inadequate yield
   and no published studies have yet addressed this problem. In the present
   study we determined that `Orri' productivity depended on conditions
   being favorable to cross-pollination. Under cross-pollination conditions
   a positive correlation (R(2) = 0.97) was found between yield per tree
   and number of fruits per tree, and more than 90\% of the fruits exceeded
   60 mm: the most profitable size range. These data suggest that the
   number of fruits per tree, and not fruit size, is the limiting factor
   for yield improvement in `Orri' orchards. Studying seed set showed that
   `Michal' mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco) is a compatible pollenizer
   for `Orri' flowers: the number of seeds per `Orri' fruit increased as
   the distance from `Michal' trees decreased. The present study
   demonstrated that cross-pollination of `Orri' resulted in yield
   improvement, yet at the price of increased seed set. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To better understand the dynamics of bee populations in crops, we
   assessed the effect of landscape context and habitat type on bee
   communities in annual entomophilous crops in Europe. We quantified bee
   communities in five pairs of crop-country: buckwheat in Poland,
   cantaloupe in France, field beans in the UK, spring oilseed rape in
   Sweden, and strawberries in Germany. For each country, 7-10 study fields
   were sampled over a gradient of increasing proportion of semi-natural
   habitats in the surrounding landscape. The CORINE land cover
   classification was used to characterize the landscape over a 3 km radius
   around each study field and we used multivariate and regression analyses
   to quantify the impact of landscape features on bee abundance and
   diversity at the sub-generic taxonomic level. Neither overall wild bee
   abundance nor diversity, taken as the number of sub-genera. was
   significantly affected by the proportion of semi-natural habitat.
   Therefore, we used the most precise level of the CORINE classification
   to examine the possible links between specific landscape features and
   wild bee communities. Bee community composition fell into three distinct
   groups across Europe: group I included Poland, Germany, and Sweden,
   group 2 the UK, and group 3 France. Among all three groups, wild bee
   abundance and sub-generic diversity were affected by 17 landscape
   elements including some semi-natural habitats (e.g., transitional wood
   land-shrub), some urban habitats (e.g., sport and leisure facilities)
   and some crop habitats (e.g., non-irrigated arable land). Some bee taxa
   were positively affected by urban habitats only, others by semi-natural
   habitats only, and others by a combination of semi-natural, urban and
   crop habitats. Bee sub-genera favoured by urban and crop habitats were
   more resistant to landscape change than those favoured only by
   semi-natural habitats. In agroecosystems, the agricultural
   intensification defined as the loss of semi-natural habitats does not
   necessarily cause a decline in evenness at the local level, but can
   change community composition towards a bee fauna dominated by common
   taxa. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Xylem heterochrony: an unappreciated key to angiosperm origin and
   diversifications}},
Journal = {{BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{26-65}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{All angiosperms can be arranged along a spectrum from a preponderance of
   juvenile traits (cambial activity lost) to one of nearly all adult
   characters (cambium maximally active, mature patterns realized rapidly
   early in ontogeny). Angiosperms are unique among seed plants in the
   width of this spectrum. Xylem patterns are considered here to be
   indicative of contemporary function, not relictual. Nevertheless, most
   families of early-divergent angiosperms exhibit paedomorphic xylem
   structure, a circumstance that is most plausibly explained by the
   concept that early angiosperms had sympodial growth forms featuring
   limited accumulation of secondary xylem. Sympodial habits have been
   retained in various ways not only in early-divergent angiosperms, but
   also among eudicots in Ranunculales. The early angiosperm vessel,
   relatively marginal in conductive abilities, was improved in various
   ways, with concurrent redesign of parenchyma and fibre systems to
   enhance conductive, storage and mechanical capabilities. Flexibility in
   degree of cambial activity and kinds of juvenile/adult expressions has
   been basic to diversification in eudicots as a whole. Sympodial growth
   that lacks cambium, such as in monocots, provides advantages by various
   features, such as organographic compartmentalization of tracheid and
   vessel types. Woody monopodial eudicots were able to diversify as a
   result of production of new solutions to embolism prevention and
   conductive efficiency, particularly in vessel design, but also in
   parenchyma histology. Criteria for paedomorphosis in wood include slow
   decrease in length of fusiform cambial initials, predominance of
   procumbent ray cells and lesser degrees of cambial activity. Retention
   of ancestral features in primary xylem (the `refugium' effect) is, in
   effect, a sort of inverse evidence of acceleration of adult patterns in
   later formed xylem. Xylem heterochrony is analysed not only for all key
   groups of angiosperms (including monocots), but also for different
   growth forms, such as lianas, annuals, various types of perennials,
   rosette trees and stem succulents. Xylary phenomena that potentially
   could be confused with heterochrony are discussed. Heterochronous xylem
   features seem at least as important as other often cited factors
   (pollination biology) because various degrees of paedomorphic xylem are
   found in so many growth forms that relate in xylary terms to ecological
   sites. Xylem heterochrony can probably be accessed during evolution by
   relatively simple gene changes in a wide range of angiosperms and thus
   represents a current as well as a past source of variation upon which
   diversification was based. Results discussed here are compatible with
   both current molecular-based phylogenetic analyses and all recent
   physiological work on conduction in xylem and thus represent an
   integration of these fields. (C) 2009 The Linnean Society of London,

Abstract = {{The volatile compounds of Citrus juices have been extracted by headspace
   solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and analysed by gas chromatography
   (CC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). This work deals
   with the analysis of 65 cross pollinated hybrid fruits and their
   parents: mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco var. Willow Leaf) and
   clementine (Citrus reticulata x Citrus sinensis var. Commune). Among the
   44 components identified which accounted for 90.2 to 99.8\% of the
   volatile fraction, limonene (56.8-93.3\%) and gamma-terpinene
   (0.1-36.4\%) were the major components in all samples. The clementine
   juice was characterised by the pre-eminence of limonene (90.0\%) and a
   minor amount of gamma-terpinene (1.2\%) while the mandarin juice
   exhibited high amount of limonene (66.3\%) and gamma-terpinene (21.1\%).
   All hybrid juices showed qualitatively similar composition but differing
   in the quantitative profile of the Couple limonene/gamma-terpinene. The
   principal component analysis (PCA) and the discriminant analysis
   indicated that hybrids samples were symmetrically distributed around the
   both parents. If some studies were found in the literature about
   mandarin juice, to our knowledge, this work is the first study on the
   volatile compounds of clementine juice and a large amount of hybrids.

Abstract = {{P> This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of
   Coincya monensis (L.) Greuter \& Burdet that are relevant to
   understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main
   topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological
   Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities,
   responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and
   physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and
   disease, history and conservation.
   Coincya monensis is represented in the British flora by two subspecies;
   ssp. monensis is a diploid, endemic taxon largely confined to open,
   coastal, sand dune habitats along the west coast of Britain; ssp.
   cheiranthos is a tetraploid neophyte (alien) of ruderal and coastal
   habitats.
   Both subspecies occur as short-lived perennials in outbreeding,
   insect-pollinated populations in open, early successional communities.
   Individuals may perennate as hemicryptophytes with buds in basal
   rosettes or as chamaephytes with buds in aerial shoot rosettes, but
   adequate seed production is essential for the long-term maintenance of
   populations. Seed production by the much larger and more floriferous
   tetraploid alien populations is much greater than that of the native
   endemic populations.
   Neither subspecies is able to compete effectively in late successional,
   grassland communities. Coincya monensis ssp. monensis benefits from
   moderate disturbance by trampling, which helps to maintain open, sandy,
   semi-fixed dune communities, such as those dominated by Marram Grass
   (Ammophila arenaria).
   Coincya monensis ssp. monensis has been designated a scarce plant in the
   British flora and is a priority species in the UK Biodiversity Action
   Plan. The main threats to its conservation are loss of habitat through
   natural successional processes and urban development. Coincya monensis
   ssp. cheiranthos is well-established in South Wales where it appears to
   be undergoing a range expansion. At present there are no known mixed
   populations of the two subspecies but this remains a possibility if the
   alien subspecies continues to expand its range. Competition and
   hybridisation between subspecies in mixed populations will present
   additional problems in the conservation of endemic biodiversity in the
   British Flora.}},

Abstract = {{Long-distance, female-produced sex pheromones are widespread among
   moths. Larval feeding provides most of the nutrients for development of
   these insects but is not thought to influence the de novo production of
   the fatty-acid derived compounds used as pheromones by most species.
   Feeding on plant nectar ( sugar) by adult moths is important for
   increasing female fitness and also for the pollination of many plant
   species. In this paper, I show that feeding on sucrose solution, as
   opposed to water, increases sex pheromone titre in mated, but not
   virgin, female Heliothis virescens. Mating caused a rapid decrease in
   haemolymph trehalose concentration, which was restored to near-virgin
   levels by sugar ingestion. When isolated mated female abdomens were
   cultured with different concentrations of trehalose, pheromone titre
   increased with increasing trehalose concentration. This effect was not
   observed when abdomens were cultured on saline containing the sugar
   rhamnose, which insects cannot metabolise to glucose. Virgins injected
   with the juvenile hormone (JH) analogue, methoprene, showed the same
   effects as mated females with respect to pheromone titre and haemolymph
   trehalose concentration. Thus, following mating increases in JH titre
   increase demand for, and lowering of, blood sugar to develop oocytes,
   which can be compensated for by sugar ingestion. Haemolymph trehalose
   concentration probably influences glycolysis in gland cells and,
   consequently, levels of cytosolic citrate and acetyl-CoA for pheromone
   biosynthesis. This increase in pheromone titre in sugar-fed, mated
   females may facilitate further mating and increased fecundity. Thus,
   exogenous sugar feeding is behaviourally and physiologically integrated
   with endogenous JH titre to maximise female fitness.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{725-737}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In order to conserve forest plant species under the particularly high
   constraints that represent urban surroundings, it is necessary to
   identify the key factors for population persistence. This study examined
   within- and between-population pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as
   pollen analogue, and genetic variation and structure using 15 allozyme
   loci in Centaurium erythraea, an insect-pollinated, early-successional
   forest biennial herb occurring in a peri-urban forest (Brussels urban
   zone, Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution,
   with most dye transfers occurring at short distances (< 15 m), and only
   a few long-distance events (up to 743 m). Flowers of C. erythraea are
   mainly visited by Syrphids (Diptera) and small bees, which are usually
   considered as short-distance pollen dispersers, and occasionally by
   bumblebees, which are usually longer-distance pollen dispersers. Small
   and large dye source populations differed in dye deposition patterns.
   The populations showed low genetic diversity, high inbreeding
   coefficients (F-IS) and high genetic differentiation (F-ST), suggesting
   restricted gene flow, which can be expected for an early-successional
   biennial species with a predominantly selfing breeding system and
   fluctuating population sizes. The positive relationship between
   recruitment rate and allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and
   the absence of significant correlations between genetic variation and
   population size suggest seedling recruitment from the seed bank,
   contributing to maintain genetic diversity. Long-distance dye dispersal
   events indicate pollinator movements along urban forest path and road
   verges. These landscape elements might therefore have a potential
   conservation value by contributing to connectivity of early-successional
   species populations located in patchy open habitats.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to model species, the self-incompatibility reaction in
   citrus has been poorly studied. It is assumed to be gametophytically
   determined and genetically controlled by the S-locus, which in other
   species encodes for glycoproteins (S-RNases) showing ribonuclease
   activity. To investigate pollen-pistil interaction, the pollen tube
   growth of two clementine varieties, `Comune' (self-incompatible) and
   `Monreal' (a `Comune' self-compatible mutation) was analysed by
   histological assays in self- and cross-pollination conditions.
   Cross-pollination assays demonstrated that the mutation leading to
   self-compatibility in `Monreal' occurred in the stylar tissues. Similar
   rates of pollen germination were observed in both genotypes. However,
   `Comune' pollen tubes showed altered morphology and arrested growth in
   the upper style while in `Monreal' they grew straight toward the ovary.
   Moreover, to identify genes putatively involved in pollen-pistil
   interaction and self-incompatibility, research based on the
   complementary DNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism technique was
   carried out to compare the transcript profiles of unpollinated and
   self-pollinated styles and stigmas of the two cultivars. This analysis
   identified 96 unigenes such as receptor-like kinases, stress-induced
   genes, transcripts involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway,
   transcription factors and genes related to calcium and hormone
   signalling. Surprisingly, a high percentage of active long terminal
   repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons were identified among the
   unigenes, indicating their activation in response to pollination and
   their possible role in the regulation of self-incompatibility genes. The
   quantitative reverse trascription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of
   selected gene tags showed transcriptional differences between the two
   genotypes during pollen germination and pollen tube elongation.}},

Title = {{Sex ratio in two species of Pegoscapus wasps (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae)

Abstract = {{The fig pollinating wasps (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae) have obligate
   arrhenotoky and a breeding structure that fits local mate competition
   (LMC). It has been traditionally assumed that LMC organisms adjust the
   sex ratio by laying a greater proportion of male eggs when there is
   superparasitism (several foundresses in a host). We tested the
   assumption with two wasp species, Pegoscapus silvestrii, pollinator of
   Ficus pertusa and Pegoscapus tonduzi, pollinator of Ficus eximia (= F.
   citrifolia), in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Total number of wasps
   and seeds were recorded in individual isolated naturally colonized
   syconia. There was a constant additive effect between the number of
   foundresses and the number of males produced in the brood of a syconium,
   while the number of females decreased. Both wasp species seem to have
   precise sex ratios and probably lay the male eggs first in the sequence,
   independently of superparasitism and clutch size: consequently, they
   have a non-random sex allocation. Each syconium of Ficus pertusa and of
   F eximia colonized by one foundress had similar mean numbers of females'
   males, and seeds. The two species of wasps studied do not seem to adjust
   the sex ratio when there is superparasitism. Pollinating fig wasp
   behavior is better explained by those models not assuming that females
   do mathematical calculations according to other females' sex ratios,
   size, number of foundresses, genetic constitution, clutch size or
   environmental conditions inside the syconium. Our results are in
   agreement with the constant male number hypothesis, not with sex ratio
   games. Rev. Biol. Trop. 57 (3): 605-621. Epub 2009 September 30.}},

Abstract = {{The Australian midge orchid Corunastylis apostasioides of the tribe
   Diurideae has completely eliminated any male contribution in the process
   of seed formation, which occurs directly from the maternal tissue by a
   process termed apomixis. Here, we report C. apostasioides to be an
   obligate apomictic species devoid of any sexuality and compare its
   development to a close sexual relative C. fimbriata (R. Br.) D.L. Jones
   \& M.A. Clem. Apomictic characteristics in C. apostasioides include
   production of seed in absence of fertilization, frequently closed
   flowers, production of immature pollen in non-dehiscent anthers,
   expansion of ovaries despite the lack of fertilization and the absence
   of a citronella scent that is found in C. fimbriata produced to attract
   pollinating vinegar flies (Jones 2006). The nature of apomixis in C.
   apostasioides was examined by ovule histology and amplified fragment
   length polymorphism (AFLP) in each case drawing comparison with sexual
   C. fimbriata. In C. apostasioides the central megaspore mother cell
   undergoes diplosporic apomixis, while additional embryos are derived
   from nucellar or integument initials formed by sporophytic apomixis.
   Typical of apomicts, C. apostasioides is polyploid compared to the
   sexual C. fimbriata. The divergences of C. apostasioides from sexuality
   to apomictic development are discussed.}},

Title = {{Recovery and characterization of a Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan.
   `Clemenules' haploid plant selected to establish the reference whole
   Citrus genome sequence}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: In recent years, the development of structural genomics has
   generated a growing interest in obtaining haploid plants. The use of
   homozygous lines presents a significant advantage for the accomplishment
   of sequencing projects. Commercial citrus species are characterized by
   high heterozygosity, making it difficult to assemble large genome
   sequences. Thus, the International Citrus Genomic Consortium (ICGC)
   decided to establish a reference whole citrus genome sequence from a
   homozygous plant. Due to the existence of important molecular resources
   and previous success in obtaining haploid clementine plants, haploid
   clementine was selected as the target for the implementation of the
   reference whole genome citrus sequence.
   Results: To obtain haploid clementine lines we used the technique of in
   situ gynogenesis induced by irradiated pollen. Flow cytometry,
   chromosome counts and SSR marker (Simple Sequence Repeats) analysis
   facilitated the identification of six different haploid lines (2n = x =
   9), one aneuploid line (2n = 2x+4 = 22) and one doubled haploid plant (
   2n = 2x = 18) of `Clemenules' clementine. One of the haploids, obtained
   directly from an original haploid embryo, grew vigorously and produced
   flowers after four years. This is the first haploid plant of clementine
   that has bloomed and we have, for the first time, characterized the
   histology of haploid and diploid flowers of clementine. Additionally a
   double haploid plant was obtained spontaneously from this haploid line.
   Conclusion: The first haploid plant of `Clemenules' clementine produced
   directly by germination of a haploid embryo, which grew vigorously and
   produced flowers, has been obtained in this work. This haploid line has
   been selected and it is being used by the ICGC to establish the
   reference sequence of the nuclear genome of citrus.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to identify the major volatiles and
   their relative concentrations in intact grapefruit, sweet orange, sour
   orange, mandarin, lemon, lime and pummelo blossoms. Volatiles from
   freshly picked blossoms were collected and concentrated using static
   headspace solid-phase microextraction and then separated and identified
   using GC-MS. Seventy volatiles were detected, 66 identified, of which 29
   were identified for the first time in citrus blossoms. Major volatiles
   consisted of linalool, beta-myrcene, alpha-myrcene, limonene,
   (E)-ocimene, methyl anthranilate and indole. In terms of total
   volatiles: pummelo >> grapefruit approximate to sweet orange > sour
   orange approximate to mandarin approximate to lemon-lime > Volkamer
   lemon > Kaffir lime. Principal component analysis of blossom volatiles
   demonstrated that there were three widely separated, tightly clustered
   groups which consisted of mandarin, lemon-lime and pummelo. Other
   cultivars of possible mixed parentage produced non-overlapping values
   within the boundaries of these three clustered groups. The first two
   Eigenvectors explained 83\% of the total variance. Linalool, limonene
   and myrcene had the highest loading values. Those cultivars requiring
   insect pollination such as pummelo produced highest levels of total
   volatiles as well as highest levels of known honeybee stimulants such as
   1-hexanol and linalool. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Seedlessness is often a desired characteristic for many types of fruits.
   A new seedless mandarin cultivar `Wuzishatangju' and its original seeded
   cultivar `Shatangju' were used to study the mechanism of seedlessness
   from the beginning of fertility. Embryonic development, compatibility of
   self-pollinated `Wuzishatangju' and cross-pollinated `Wuzishatangju'
   ('Wuzishatangju' x `Ponkan', `Wuzishatangju' x `Shatangju') were
   studied. Results indicated that the male gametes of `Wuzishatangju' were
   healthy. Fertility of the `Wuzishatangju' embryo sac was normal and the
   mature embryo sac had one egg, two synergids, three antipodal cells and
   one big central cell containing two polar nuclei. Embryonic development
   of cross-pollinated `Wuzishatangju' was normal. Many globular embryos
   and a few heart-shaped embryos were observed 2 weeks after
   cross-pollination (WACP). Heart- and torpedo-shaped embryos were
   observed at three WACP while embryos reached the torpedo stage at four
   WACP. Cotyledonary embryos were observed at five WACP and they developed
   into seeds while funiculi were still existent at seven WACP. However,
   embryonic development of self-pollinated `Wuzishatangju' was abnormal
   and most embryos, which degenerated by 2 weeks after self-pollination
   (WASP), disappeared and seedless fruits were produced by four WASP.
   Pollen tubes of cross-pollinated `Wuzishatangju' could grow normally in
   the stigma, style and ovary, and they entered into the embryo sac
   resulting in successful fertilization. The pollen tubes of
   self-pollinated `Wuzishatangju' grew well in the stigma and style;
   however, when they entered into the ovary, they became twisted and could
   not enter the embryo sac. Results indicate that the activities of the
   male gamete and the fertility of the embryo sac of `Wuzishatangiu' were
   functioning normally with no embryo abortion during embryonic
   development. Gametophytic self-incompatibility (SI) caused seedlessness
   in `Wuzishatangju' by blocking fertilization in the ovary. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{The inactivation of pollen by soft X-ray irradiation and subsequent
   artificial pollination are time-intensive practices used in the
   production of seedless watermelons (Citrullus lanatus L.). Watermelon
   generally has a lot of staminate flowers; however, they only have a
   small amount of pollen. Watermelon pollen cannot be used in pollination
   under the present situation. Therefore, the objective of this study was
   to determine which is the most effective pollen extender medium for
   cultivation of watermelon with soft X-ray irradiated pollen. In this
   experiment, `Agar,' `Marriage powder,' and `Sekishoshi' (Lycopodium dyed
   red with safflower pigment) were used as extender media with soft X-ray
   irradiated pollen at equal or twice the weight of the pollen. When
   `Sekishoshi' was used as an extender medium, fruit set was very low. A
   lot of deformed fruit was produced when agar was used with the pollen.
   On the other hand, when `Marriage powder' was used in equal proportions
   with the pollen, fruit set was about 70\% and, moreover. Brix was high.
   Thus, the mixture of `Marriage powder' with an equal amount of pollen
   was the best for use in actual cultivation. We conclude, then, that soft
   X-ray irradiated pollen in an extender medium can be effectively adapted
   for producing seedless watermelons. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Low yields of `Nova' citrus hybrid are common in single variety
   plantings (plantings consisting of one variety) due to its sexual
   self-incompatibility. Self-incompatibility may be overcome by
   cross-pollination with other compatible varieties. Fruit quality and
   yield of `Nova' citrus hybrid as well as of the `SRA63' and `Marisol'
   Clementines, when either they were self-pollinated in single variety
   plantings or each one of the two Clementine varieties was used as a
   pollenizer for `Nova' in mixed plantings (plantings consisting of more
   than one variety), were investigated. The study was carried out for two
   successive years under the same environmental and cultural conditions
   using three single variety plantings ('Nova' x `Nova', `SRA63' x
   `SRA63','Marisol' x `Marisol') and two mixed plantings ('Nova' x
   `SRA63', `Nova' x `Marisol').
   Cross-pollination of `Nova' with either `SRA63' or `Marisol'
   significantly increased fruit yield of `Nova' trees and mean fresh
   weight of `Nova' fruits without affecting the other fruit quality
   parameters {[}rind thickness, percentage of juice, concentration of
   total soluble solids (TSS) and total acids (TA) in the juice, and TSS/TA
   ratio). Although the number of seeds per each `Nova' fruit significantly
   increased due to cross-pollination (from 0.7 in `Nova' x `Nova' planting
   to 1.8 and 2.1 in `Nova' x `Marisol' and `Nova' x `SRA63' plantings,
   respectively), it remained in a range (<= 2.1) which is by far
   acceptable in the fresh fruit market. On the other hand, each fruit
   produced by cross-pollinated `Marisol' and `SRA63' trees with `Nova'
   contained an average of 2.4 and 18.6 seeds, respectively. The effects of
   `Nova' pollen on the other fruit quality parameters (weight, TSS, TA,
   TSS/TA, juice content, rind thickness) of `Marisol' and `SRA63' were not
   significant. Therefore, `Marisol' was proved to be a good pollenizer for
   `Nova' and vice versa. Furthermore, `SRA63' can be used as pollenizer in
   `Nova' orchards. Instead, the use of `Nova' trees as pollenizers in
   `SRA63' orchards should be avoided since the seediness of `SRA63' fruits
   was increased very much. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The spotted gum species complex represents a group of four eucalypt
   hardwood taxa that have a native range that spans the east coast of
   Australia, with a morphological cline from Victoria to northern
   Queensland. Of this group, Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata (CCV) is
   widespread in south-eastern Queensland and northern New South Wales. It
   is currently the most commonly harvested native hardwood in Queensland.
   However, little basic knowledge of the reproductive biology of the
   species is available to inform genetic improvement and resource
   management programmes. Here we take an integrative approach, using both
   field and molecular data, to identify ecological factors important to
   mating patterns in native populations of CCV. Field observation of
   pollinator visitation and flowering phenology of 20 trees showed that
   foraging behaviour of pollinator guilds varies depending on flowering
   phenology and canopy structure. A positive effect of tree mean flowering
   effort was found on insect visitation, while bat visitation was
   predicted by tree height and by the number of trees simultaneously
   bearing flowers. Moreover, introduced honeybees were observed
   frequently, performing 73\% of detected flower visits. Conversely,
   nectar-feeding birds and mammals were observed sporadically with
   lorikeets and honeyeaters each contributing to 11\% of visits. Fruit
   bats, represented solely by the grey-headed flying fox, performed less
   than 2\% of visits. Genotyping at six microsatellite markers in 301
   seeds from 17 families sampled from four of Queensland's native forests
   showed that CCV displays a mixed-mating system that is mostly
   outcrossing (t(m) = 0.899 +/- 0.021). Preferential effective pollination
   from near-neighbours was detected by means of maximum-likelihood
   paternity analysis with up to 16\% of reproduction events resulting from
   selfing. Forty to 48\% of fertilising pollen was also carried from
   longer distance (>60 m). Marked differences in foraging behaviour and
   visitation frequency between observed pollinator guilds suggests that
   the observed dichotomy of effective pollen movement in spotted gums may
   be due to frequent visit from introduced honeybees favouring geitonogamy
   and sporadic visits from honeyeaters and fruit bats resulting in
   potential long-distance pollinations.}},

Title = {{Bumble Bees (Bombus spp) along a Gradient of Increasing Urbanization}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bumble bees and other wild bees are important pollinators of
   wild flowers and several cultivated crop plants, and have declined in
   diversity and abundance during the last decades. The main cause of the
   decline is believed to be habitat destruction and fragmentation
   associated with urbanization and agricultural intensification.
   Urbanization is a process that involves dramatic and persistent changes
   of the landscape, increasing the amount of built-up areas while
   decreasing the amount of green areas. However, urban green areas can
   also provide suitable alternative habitats for wild bees.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied bumble bees in allotment
   gardens, i.e. intensively managed flower rich green areas, along a
   gradient of urbanization from the inner city of Stockholm towards more
   rural (periurban) areas. Keeping habitat quality similar along the
   urbanization gradient allowed us to separate the effect of landscape
   change (e.g. proportion impervious surface) from variation in habitat
   quality. Bumble bee diversity (after rarefaction to 25 individuals)
   decreased with increasing urbanization, from around eight species on
   sites in more rural areas to between five and six species in urban
   allotment gardens. Bumble bee abundance and species composition were
   most affected by qualities related to the management of the allotment
   areas, such as local flower abundance. The variability in bumble bee
   visits between allotment gardens was higher in an urban than in a
   periurban context, particularly among small and long-tongued bumble bee
   species.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that allotment gardens and
   other urban green areas can serve as important alternatives to natural
   habitats for many bumble bee species, but that the surrounding urban
   landscape influences how many species that will be present. The higher
   variability in abundance of certain species in the most urban areas may
   indicate a weaker reliability of the ecosystem service pollination in
   areas strongly influenced by human activity.}},

Abstract = {{We explored the use of ecological niche-modeling from data compiled in a

   quantitatively evaluate the spatial risk of invasion by the alien
   species Bombus terrestris. B. terrestris has been commercially
   introduced to japan for the pollination of greenhouse tomato crops since
   1991. Recently, naturalized populations of this species have spread
   rapidly, particularly in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Two niche-based
   models were constructed from independent data sets (presence-absence and
   presence-only data sets) and were used to validate one another. Both
   models performed well and indicated that the data compiled by
   participatory programs were useful for generating predictive models of
   the potential distribution of this invasive species. The models also
   revealed that the potential distribution of B. terrestris is negatively
   related to the proportion of woodland area, which corresponds to the
   known biology of this species. In contrast, the effect of the number of
   colonies introduced for tomato pollination (represented by tomato
   production) did not significantly affect the distribution of B.
   terrestris, indicating that its spread is now entering a phase of
   dispersal from established feral populations and that primary dispersal
   from commercial colonies in greenhouses is no longer a limiting factor
   for the distribution of this invasive species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Year = {{2009}},

Abstract = {{This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of
   Primula veris that are relevant to understanding its ecological
   characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the
   standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles:
   distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors,
   responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral
   and seed characters, herbivores and diseases, history and conservation.
   Primula veris is a distylous, perennial rosette hemicryptophyte, mostly
   found in well-drained, herb-rich meadows and grasslands, in scrub or
   woodland rides and edges, and on calcareous cliffs. It occurs on
   base-rich loams or clays, on limestone, and sometimes in dunes.
   Native to the British Isles, it is characteristic of many mesotrophic
   and calcicolous lowland grassland communities, but it also extends into
   upland valleys in northern England and Scotland. In Ireland it is also
   native and most abundant in the central plain. Primula veris occurs
   throughout the temperate areas of Europe as far east as the Russian
   border.
   Primula veris is a shade-intolerant species that shows reduced
   performance and flowering under shade or increased competition. The
   species is not able to penetrate anoxic soil layers and is therefore
   mostly absent from locations that are characterized by a high water
   table. It has a well-developed drought tolerance.
   Primula veris is an obligate outbreeder which entirely depends on
   foraging insects for successful pollination. Although the species shows
   heterostyly, with two reciprocal morphs (pin and thrum), only relatively
   low levels of intermorph pollination have been reported. Seed dispersal
   is restricted to a few centimetres from maternal plants, whereas pollen
   flow is wider, but still limited to a few metres from parental plants.
   Both are factors that contribute to a significantly fine-scale spatial
   genetic structure and small neighbourhood size.
   At several locations throughout the British Isles, P. veris occurs
   together with P. elatior and especially P. vulgaris. The hybrid P. veris
   x P. vulgaris = P. x polyantha occurs frequently in mixed populations,
   whereas the hybrid P. veris x P. elatior = P. x media has been rarely
   reported in Britain.
   Although P. veris is still a widespread grassland herb, it is less
   abundant in the British Isles and continental Europe than before. This
   decline can be attributed to changes in land-use practices, such as the
   loss of traditional hay-meadow management, the loss of grazing and an
   increase of ploughing, in combination with ongoing destruction and
   nutrient enrichment of permanent grasslands. However, from 1980 onwards
   the species has increased substantially in many areas of the UK, largely
   because its seeds are included in wildflower seed-mixtures that are sown
   on new or upgraded road and motorway verges, embankments and urban
   conservation areas.}},

Title = {{A hawkmoth crossroads? Species richness, seasonality and biogeographical

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was (1) to describe the biodiversity of the
   sphingid assemblage in a Cerrado area in the Triangulo Mineiro region,
   south-east of Brazil; (2) to evaluate the seasonal variations in species
   composition; (3) to compare the faunistic relationships between the
   Cerrado biome and adjacent ecosystems; and (4) to analyse the
   biogeographical pattern of species distribution in the Neotropical
   region in a historical context.
   Panga Ecological Station (PES), 30 km south of the city of Uberlandia,
   and other areas of the Triangulo Mineiro region, Minas Gerais state,
   south-eastern Brazil.
   Moth richness and abundance were monitored monthly at the PES from
   August 2003 to July 2004, with additional collections at this locality
   in 2001/2002, 2005 and 2006. Complementary moth richness and abundance
   data were also collected in other areas of the Triangulo Mineiro region.
   All collections were made using light traps, and the hawkmoths were
   mounted and identified. Cluster analysis, rarefaction curves and
   estimators of total species richness were used to compare the Cerrado
   hawkmoth assemblage with assemblages derived from other surveys in the
   Neotropics.
   In total, 61 hawkmoth species were recorded for the study region and
   their occurrence was markedly seasonal. The hawkmoth assemblage in the
   study area presented the closest similarity with rain forest areas and
   with a tropical dry forest area in Central America. The area shared
   species with both rain forest and seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF)
   ecosystems, including supposedly endemic species previously recorded
   only in the latter areas. Rarefaction curves and estimators of the total
   number of species showed species richness to be comparable with other
   highly diverse forest areas in the Neotropics, such as the Brazilian
   Amazon and Costa Rica.
   This short-term study is the first systematic survey of hawkmoths in the
   Cerrado. It has recorded around 22\% of the South American fauna and
   highlighted the high species richness of the region, which compares
   favourably with that in other rain forest ecosystems. The survey
   indicates high regional diversity, and has shown that the Cerrado
   harbours a hawkmoth fauna comprising both rain forest elements, probably
   distributed along humid gallery forest corridors, and SDTF elements,
   supporting the idea of a historical Pleistocene arc connecting the
   Caatinga domain and other seasonal dry forest areas across the Cerrado
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Phytophthora capsici causes severe losses in vegetable production,
   including many cucurbit crops. Our previous work showed that cucumber
   (Cucumis sativus) fruit are most susceptible to P. capsici when they are
   very young and rapidly elongating, but develop resistance as they
   approach full length at 10 to 12 days postpollination (DPP). In this
   study, fruit from seven additional cucurbit crops representing four
   species, melon (Cucumis melo), butternut squash (Cucurbita moschata),
   watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), and zucchini, yellow summer squash,
   acorn squash, and pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo), were tested for the effect
   of fruit development on susceptibility to P. capsici. Field-grown fruit
   of the different crops varied in overall susceptibility. Zucchini and
   yellow summer squash were the most susceptible, with the majority of
   fruit exhibiting water-soaking symptoms within 24 hours postinoculation.
   Fruit from all of the crops exhibited size-related decrease in
   susceptibility, but to varying degrees. Cucumber had the most pronounced
   effect. In infested fields, cucumber fruit were found to be most
   frequently infected at the blossom end. Comparison of the peduncle and
   blossom end showed a difference in susceptibility along the length of
   the fruit for cucumber, butternut squash, and zucchini.
   Greenhouse-grown, hand-pollinated pumpkin, acorn squash, and butternut
   squash showed an age-related decrease in susceptibility similar to
   field-grown fruit. For all of these fruit, a pronounced reduction in
   susceptibility accompanied the transition from the waxy green to green
   stage at 3 to 8 DPP.}},

Title = {{An invasive dandelion unilaterally reduces the reproduction of a native
   congener through competition for pollination}},
Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{159}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{559-569}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The impact of invasive alien species on native species is of increasing
   global concern. Invasive plants have various negative effects on natives
   through competition; however, relatively little is known about
   competition for pollination. The relationship between Japanese native
   dandelions (Taraxacum spp.) and invasive congeners may be a typical case
   of such an interaction. For example, native dandelions are being
   replaced by invasive congeners, especially in urban and suburban areas
   of Japan. To explain this phenomenon, we hypothesized that when natives
   are mixed with attractive invasives, natives may suffer from reduced
   seed set because invasives deprive natives of pollinators or because
   pollinators frequently move between species, resulting in interspecific
   pollen transfer. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of the
   invasive dandelion T. officinale on the pollination and seed set of the
   native T. japonicum using artificial arrays of monospecific and
   mixed-species plots as well as natural populations. Taraxacum officinale
   attracted more pollinator visits, perhaps because it produced more
   nectar than T. japonicum. The number of pollinator visits to T.
   japonicum was reduced when the congeners were grown together, and
   pollinators moved frequently between the two species. The proportion of
   seed set for T. japonicum was reduced in the presence of T. officinale
   in both artificial arrays and natural populations. These results support
   our hypothesis that interspecific competition for pollination plays an
   important role in the recent replacement of native dandelions by
   invasive congeners in Japan. Because invasive dandelions are apomicts,
   negative effects are incurred only by sexual natives. Thus, this system
   can be recognized as a rare case of interspecific interaction through
   pollination.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic determinants of the organisation and variation of the
   flower, a striking feature of the angiosperms, are only beginning to be
   deciphered. Floral symmetry has recurrently evolved among angiosperms,
   zygomorphy (monosymmetry) being a key innovation due to its role in the
   plant-pollination interaction. As such, it represents a case study for
   evo-devo. Phylogenetic comparative studies conducted in two eudicot
   clades, the Ranunculales and the Asteridae sensu APGII, have shown that
   the evolution of this trait is dependent upon the architectural context
   of the flower. Genetic and developmental bases of zygomorphy have been
   investigated in several unrelated model species. In all these species,
   zygomorphy appears to be controlled, at least partially, by genes
   belonging to the TCP gene family of transcription factors and named
   CYC-like genes. Exploring the molecular bases of zygomorphy in non-model
   species spanning the diversity of angiosperms, but also the
   developmental processes involved, are now essential to understand the
   evolution of floral symmetry. To cite this article: E Jabbour et al., C

Abstract = {{We assessed the ecological value of golf courses based on a quantitative
   synthesis of studies in the scientific literature that have measured and
   compared biota on golf courses to that of biota in green-area habitats
   related to other land uses. We found that golf courses had higher
   ecological value in 64\% of comparative cases. This pattern was
   consistent also for comparisons based on measures of species richness,
   as well as for comparisons of overall measures of birds and insects-the
   fauna groups most widely examined in the studies. Many golf courses also
   contribute to the preservation of fauna of conservation concern. More
   broadly, we found that the ecological value of golf courses
   significantly decreases with land types having low levels of
   anthropogenic impact, like natural and nature-protected areas.
   Conversely, the value of golf courses significantly increases with land
   that has high levels of anthropogenic impact, like agricultural and
   urban lands. From an ecosystem management perspective, golf courses
   represent a promising measure for restoring and enhancing biodiversity
   in ecologically simplified landscapes. Furthermore, the review suggests
   that golf courses hold a real potential to be designed and managed to
   promote critical ecosystem services, like pollination and natural pest
   control, providing an opportunity for joint collaboration among
   conservation, restoration and recreational interests.}},

Journal = {{HORTSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{49-52}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Insect pollinators such as honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) and humble bees
   (Bombus spp.) are strongly directional in their movements among flowers
   and typically move to the nearest neighboring inflorescence, which is
   often in the same row. Pollinator movements in watermelon {[}Citrullus
   lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum \& Nakai] were determined by tracking pollen
   flow with the incompletely dominant lobed-leaf trait of. `Crimson Sweet'
   (AY) as the pollen donor and the incompletely recessive `Sunshade' (W)
   as the recipient. Mature `Sunshade' watermelon fruit were collected at
   3-in increments down selected rows and across all rows in both
   directions from the central donor plants that made up 1\% of the
   planting. The resulting progenies from each fruit collected were
   screened to determine the directionality of pollinator movements by pe).
   The row that went through the occurrence of the Nlnl genotype (or
   lobed-leaf phenotype central donor plant block had higher percentages of
   lobed-leaf seedlings compared with the other rows evaluated. However,
   lobed-leaf seedlings were observed oil rows at significant distances
   (greater than 10 m) from the donor block. This resulted most likely from
   long-distance pollen transport, in-hive pollen transfer, or multiple
   transfers of pollen to staminate (male) and/or pistillate (female)
   flowers by pollinators before reaching the final destination on a
   stigmatic surface at a substantial distance from donor plants. Because
   watermelon vines grow out in all directions, including across rows, a
   pollinator can easily move to adjacent flowers on a vine growing across
   rows; thus, the movements of pollinators in watermelon (and most likely
   other vining cucurbits) are not as simple as maintaining a linear
   direction down the row.}},

   Characteristics of Watermelon Pollenizers}},
Journal = {{HORTSCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Triploid (seedless) watermelon {[}Citrullus lanatus (Thunh.) Matsum. and
   Nak.] pollen is nonviable, thus, diploid (pollenizer) watermelon
   cultigens are required to supply viable pollen for triploid watermelon
   fruit set. The objective of this research was to characterize maximum
   potential vegetative growth, staminate and pistillate flower production
   over time, and measure exterior and interior fruit characteristics of
   pollenizer cultigens. Sixteen commercially available and numbered line
   (hereafter collectively referred to as cultigens) pollenizer and two
   triploid cultigens were evaluated in 2005 and 2006 at Clayton, NC.
   Vegetative growth was measured using vine and internode length, and
   staminate and pistillate flower development was counted weekly. Fruit
   quality and quantity were determined by measuring individual fruit
   weights, soluble solids, and rind thickness. Based oil vegetative
   growth, pollenizer cultigens were placed into two distinct groups.
   Pollenizers, which produced a compact or dwarf plant were `Companion,
   `Sidekick', `TP91', `TPS92', and `WC5108-1216'. Pollenizers having a
   standard vine length were `Jenny', `High Set 11', `Mickylee, `Minipol',
   `Pinnacle', `Summer Flavor 800' ('SF800'), `Super Pollenizer V ('SP1'),
   and `W1-16818{''}. Cultigens with compact growth habit had shorter
   internodes and vine lengths compared with the cultigens with standard
   growth habit. Cultigens with the greatest quantity of staminate flower
   production through the entire season were `Sidekick' and `SP1'. The
   lowest number of staminate flowers was produced by `TP91' and `TPS92'.
   Based on fruit quality characteristics and production, pollenizers
   currently or possibly marketed for consumption include `Mickylee',
   `SF800', `Nlinipol', `Jenny', and `Pinnacle. The remaining cultigens
   evaluated in this study should be used strictly as pollenizers based on
   fruit quality. Arrangement of diploid pollenizers in a commercial
   planting of triploid watermelons is an important consideration depending
   on plant vegetative development. Based on staminate flower production,
   cultigens with higher staminate flower production are potentially
   superior pollenizers and may lead to improved triploid quality and
   production. Furthermore, pollenizer selection by fruit characteristics
   should include a rind pattern easily distinguished from triploid fruit
   in the field. doubt}},

Abstract = {{In fragmented habitats, one cause of the decrease of plant diversity and
   abundance is the disruption of plant-animal interactions, and in
   particular plant-pollinator interactions. Since habitat fragmentation
   acts both on pollinator behaviour and plant reproduction, its
   consequences for the stability of such interactions are complex. An
   extreme case of habitat fragmentation occurs in urbanised areas where
   suitable habitat (in the present study small patches around ornamental
   trees) is embedded in a highly unsuitable environment (concrete matrix).
   Based on simple experiments, we ask whether pollinators can adapt their
   foraging behaviour in response to the amount of available resources
   (flowers) in the fragments and their isolation, as predicted by the
   optimal foraging theory. To do so we analysed the effect of
   fragmentation on the behaviour of pollinators visiting Crepis sancta
   (L.) Bornm. (Asteraceae), which forms large populations in the
   countryside and patchy populations in urban environments. More precisely
   we studied pollinator visitation rates, capitulum visit durations,
   capitulum search durations and capitulum size choice. Pollinators chose
   larger capitula in both types of populations and their foraging
   behaviour differed between the two population types in three ways: (1)
   pollinator visits were lower in urban fragmented populations, perhaps
   due to the lower accessibility of urban patches; (2) capitulum visit
   durations were longer in urban fragmented populations, a possible
   compensation of energy lost during flights among patches; and (3)
   capitulum search durations where longer in urban fragmented populations,
   which may represent an increase in capitulum prospecting effort. We
   discuss the possible impacts of such differences for plant population
   functioning in the two types of populations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{Haploid and doubled haploid (DH) production provides a particularly
   attractive biotechnological tool in breeding of perennial crop species,
   such as fruit trees. Haploids (plants with a gametophytic chromosome
   number) and doubled haploids (haploids that have undergone chromosome
   duplication) reduce the time needed to produce homozygous lines compared
   to conventional breeding. In fruit crops, characterized by high
   heterozygosity, long generation cycle times, large size, and (often)
   self-incompatibility, there is no other way to produce homozygous
   breeding lines through conventional methods that involve several
   generations of selfing. Gametic embryogenesis, enables the development
   of haploids and double haploids from heterozygous parents in a single
   step, and is therefore increasingly the object of research for fruit
   breeders. This chapter provides the current status of research on
   doubled haploid production in many fruit crops: Actinidia deliciosa,

Abstract = {{In urban areas, wetland habitats consist of small isolated remnants,
   embedded in an inhospitable human-used matrix, and incurring strong
   anthropogenic pressures (e.g., artificialization, pollution,
   eutrophication, and exotic species invasions). These can lead to
   detrimental genetic and demographic consequences for the populations,
   even for common species. This study investigated genetic variation and
   structure for 12 allozyme loci and reproductive fitness in populations
   of Lychnis (Caryophyllaceae), an insect-pollinated perennial herb
   occurring in wetland fragments and along the Woluwe River, in Brussels
   urban zone (Belgium), in relation to population size. No effect of
   population size on genetic variation and usually low between-population
   genetic differentiation were found for urban populations of L.
   flos-cuculi. A significant pattern of isolation by distance indicated
   that beyond a certain distance, especially along the Woluwe, populations
   might still exchange genes. Floral display and fruit set increased with
   population size, but this relationship did not seem to be predominant.
   Significant differences found among populations suggest that other
   factors (e.g., plant density, neighbour competition and habitat quality)
   may have a stronger impact on reproductive fitness. Some of the small
   populations may also be still connected through pollen flow, increasing
   reproductive success and preventing inbreeding depression. The present
   findings suggest that populations of L. flos-cuculi in Brussels urban
   zone are not prone to the detrimental effects of habitat fragmentation,
   as we may have expected, despite the relative small size of the
   populations. These genetically diverse and productive populations can
   still be considered of conservation value, including the small ones,
   which within a certain spatial distance might be regarded as important
   connecting components of pollen-exchanging network of populations,
   buffering populations against the negative effects of small population
   size. The conservation of L. flos-cuculi in Brussels urban zone should
   favour the preservation of connected populations rather than only
   preserving isolated wetlands.}},

Abstract = {{Vancetovic J., Lj. Jankuloski, S. Bozinovic and D. Dodig (2009): The
   effects of cytoplasmic male sterility and xenia on the chemical
   composition of maize grain - Genetika, Vol. 41, No. 1, 95 - 106. Sterile
   hybrids often outyield their fertile counterparts, especially if
   pollinated by a genetically unrelated pollinator. The combined effect of
   cms and xenia is referred to as the Plus-hybrid effect. The objective of
   this study was to determine the individual, as well as, combining effect
   of erns and xenia on the maize grain chemical composition. The percent
   of oil, protein and starch in the grain was also observed.
   Two sterile hybrids, their fertile counterparts and five fertile
   pollinator-hybrids were selected for the studies. The three-replicate
   trial set up according to the split-plot experimental design was
   performed at Zemun Polje in 2008.
   The obtained results show that the effects of ems on the oil percent was
   not significant in the studied hybrid ZP 341, while it increased at the
   significance level of P = 0.1 in the second observed hybrid ZP 360. The
   effect of this factor on the protein and starch percent was also
   significant (P = 0.01) in some hybrid combinations. Xenia effects on all
   three chemical parameters were significant (P = 0.01) in some hybrid
   combinations. The gained results indicate that the identification of a
   good combination of two hybrids, in which one would be a sterile female
   component, and the other a pollinator, would end up not only in the
   increased yield, but also in the improved maize grain quality.}},

Abstract = {{In Japan, one of the major problems in producing good quality blueberry
   fruit is that the harvesting season of many highbush blueberry
   (Vaccinium corymbosum) cultivars occurs during the rainy season (June
   and July). For this reason, we have been investigating a proper method
   to force blueberries into producing mature fruit before the rainy
   season. Many southern highbush cultivars were grown under heating
   culture, and the flowering and harvesting time, percentage of harvest
   and yield, and fruit quality parameters were determined. The potted
   plants were transferred from outdoors into a plastic house at the
   beginning of February in 2006 and 2007. Temperature was maintained
   between 10 degrees C and 35 degrees C with heating until the middle of
   May in both years. Bee pollination, watering, fertilizing were performed
   using conventional methods. Although some differences occurred from year
   to year, flowering and harvesting time were advanced 30-40 days under
   heating culture, compared to the open field culture. The ripening and
   harvesting time of all cultivars were almost completed before the rainy
   season began, regardless of the differences of plant age and pot soil.
   Fruit size, juice pH, soluble solid content, citric acid content and
   soluble solid-acid ratio differed among the cultivars. We found that
   these characteristics also varied with year, plant age and pot soil.
   From the results we conclude that heating culture of southern highbush
   blueberry is effective in forcing blueberries plants to produce mature
   fruit before the rainy season begins in Japan. We have demonstrated the
   effective date and the proper method of heating culture, including the
   start and length of heating period, heating temperature, pot culture and
   the use of recommended cultivars of southern highbush blueberry.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental situation was created in which watermelon and sunflower
   were blooming simultaneously and competing for pollinators. Measures of
   watermelon flowering and bee visitation were made for three consecutive
   weeks of bloom and followed by measures of fruit at harvest. The honey
   bee attractant Fruit Boost (TM) was tested for its efficacy in focusing
   honey bees onto the target crop (watermelon) and improving pollination.
   Fruit Boost did not significantly affect total number of honey bees
   visiting watermelon flowers, the proportion of honey bee visits that
   occurred on female flowers, fruit-set, or fruit weight. The onset of
   sunflower bloom on week 2 was associated with a sequential drop in honey
   bee numbers on watermelon between weeks 1-3, a near absence of fruit set
   after week 1, and significant decrease in melon size between weeks 1 and
   3. More broadly, this study suggests that pollination is compromised in
   agro-ecosystems where crops or feral plants are competing for limited
   pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Most cultivars of European pear (Pyrus communis L.) exhibit
   S-RNase-based gametophytic self-incompatibility (SI), but the cultivar,
   `Grand Champion', is partially self-compatible (SC). We used pollination
   and molecular genetic approaches to study the cause of the partial SC,
   and its effects on fruit set and quality. `Grand Champion' was genotyped
   to SbSe by an S-RNase-based cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence
   marker system. Crossing `Grand Champion' with pollen from an SI
   cultivar, `California' (SbSe), showed that partial SC was caused by the
   disruption of pistil function. Of the S-b- and S-e-RNase alleles cloned
   from `Grand Champion', the S-b-RNase allele had two non-synonymous
   nucleotide substitutions compared with the S-b-RNase allele previously
   cloned from `Doyenne du Comice', but it retained the typical primary
   structure of S-RNases of the Maloideae. The sequence of the S-b-RNase
   allele from `Grand Champion' was also obtained from two SI cultivars:
   `Josephine de Malines' and `Urbaniste'. Similar levels of S-b- and
   S-e-RNase allele transcripts were found in the pistils of the partially
   SC and SI cultivars. S-b- and S-e-haplotypes in the selfed progeny of
   `Grand Champion' segregated in a 1:1 ratio. `Grand Champion' fruits
   formed by self-pollination were the same size and quality as those
   formed by cross-pollination. Our results suggest that partial SC was not
   caused by a mutation in the S-RNase allele. The partial SC in `Grand
   Champion' results in efficient fruit set and fruit of economic size and
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of seedlessness derived from `Mukaku Kishu' (Citrus
   kinokuni hort. ex Tanaka) was investigated histologically. Neither
   perfect nor imperfect seeds found in seedy cultivars/offspring were
   formed in `Mukaku Kishu' and its seedless descendants. Among `Mukaku
   Kishu' and its seedless descendants, the fertilized seed type (termed
   ``type A seeds{''}) with an immature, soft seed coat was specifically
   observed. In most seedless cultivars/offspring, all embryos of type A
   seeds were arrested at the zygote or proembryo stage, and embryo
   development was arrested 10 weeks after pollination. These results
   indicate that the expression of Mukaku Kishu-type seedlessness is
   characteristic of a forming type A seed with an immature seed coat and
   an embryo arrested at an early stage. Endosperm abortion in type A seeds
   was not observed. Therefore, we demonstrated that an arrested embryo
   development in the type A seed is not caused by endosperm abortion.
   Because the expression of Mukaku Kishu-type seedlessness is not
   controlled by the embryo genotype, type A seed production would not be
   caused by gene expression in embryos but by that in maternal tissues,
   more likely in the immature seed coat tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term monitoring of bees in specific sites provides information on
   changes in species diversity and abundance, especially in areas close to
   human habitation. Evaluations of this monitoring data combined with
   relevant measures of anthropogenic activity can aide in interpreting
   emerging patterns of bee pollinators. In 1972, we sampled bees visiting
   flowers of a population of the leguminous tree, Andira inermis (W.
   Wright) DC in a dry forest site adjacent to the town of Liberia,
   Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. Slightly more than 800 bees were
   recorded on the average per tree site, with an overall bee diversity
   among the trees of approximately 70 species. Standardized bee samples
   were taken again from the same population of A. inermis in 1996, 1999,
   and 2004. In each of these years average abundance level per tree was
   greatly reduced, as was overall species diversity. Andira inermis trees
   were also observed to have variable attraction for large anthophorid
   bees versus honey bees. Some trees attracted significantly more
   anthophorids than honey bees, whereas other trees attracted the
   opposite.
   Since 1972 there were many changes in land use that were directly
   related to a rapidly growing human population in Liberia. These changes,
   which greatly modified the natural landscape and vegetation, are
   believed to have caused a major decline in species diversity and
   abundance of bees to a low but consistent level. Concurrently, increased
   urban growth has resulted in many more residential neighborhoods that
   have a wide variety of ornamental flowering plant species, many of which
   are native to Costa Rica, that attract a wide variety of native bee
   species. Evidence is offered to suggest that urban residential areas
   represent a source of bees that continue to visit A. inermis at low
   levels in and immediately around Liberia.}},

Abstract = {{Eighty six full-sib Corymbia F-1 hybrid families (crosses between C.
   torelliana and four spotted gum taxa: C. citriodora subsp. variegata, C.
   citriodora subsp. citriodora, C. henryi and C. maculata), were planted
   in six trials across six disparate sites in south-eastern Queensland to
   evaluate their productivity and determine their potential utility for
   plantation forestry. In each trial, the best-growing 20\% of hybrid
   families grew significantly faster (P = 0.05) than open-pollinated
   seedlots of the parent species Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata,
   ranging from 107\% to 181\% and 127\% to 287\% of the height and
   diameter respectively. Relative performance of hybrid families growing
   on more than one site displayed consistency in ranking for growth across
   sites and analysis showed low genotype-by-environment interaction.
   Heritability estimates based on female and male parents across two sites
   at age six years for height and diameter at breast height, were high
   (0.62 +/- 0.28 to 0.64 +/- 0.35 and 0.31 +/- 0.21 to 0.69 +/- 0.37
   respectively), and low to moderate (0.03 +/- 0.04 to 0.33 +/- 0.22) for
   stem straightness, branch size, incidence of ramicorns, and frost and
   disease resistance traits at ages one to three years. The proportion of
   dominance variance for height and diameter had reduced to zero by age
   six years.

Abstract = {{Hymenoptera is one of the largest orders of insects and comprises wasps,
   bees, and ants. With the intensification of agriculture and consequently
   simplification of the structure of agricultural landscapes, this group
   has received more attention, as it contains key species to the structure
   of ecosystems such as ants and wasps that control phytophagous insects
   or bees pollinating the native vegetation. This study aimed at examining
   the communities of two taxa of Hymenoptera in an agricultural area using
   direct seeding in Rio Claro city, southeastern Sao Paulo, with Moericke
   traps, focusing on the abundance of parasitoids and richness of
   Formicidae. A total of 5308 parasitoid hymenopterans was collected,
   comprising 8 superfamilies and 22 families; Mymaridae was the most
   abundant. Among Formicidae, 6039 individuals, 38 morphospecies, 19
   genera, 16 tribes, and 7 subfamilies were collected; Myrmicinae was the
   richest. the composition of these communities as a result of direct
   seeding and the importance of the use of Moericke traps in environmental
   monitoring are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Doctors need to consider all kinds of traits and risk factors about a
   person in a treatment situation, while antidiscrimination law puts
   significant restrictions on what an employer can consider about a person
   in hiring. These two contexts - health care and the
   antidiscrimination-governed workplace - seem to adopt entirely
   incompatible conceptions of how to regard the person, and hence, what
   rights she is considered to deserve. Therefore, how can we make sense of
   the claim by fat acceptance advocates that doctors discriminate against
   them based on their weight? Even when little or no formal rights exist
   for fat citizens in either sphere, there are nonetheless transformative
   discourses available that cross-pollinate each context. Revisiting
   rights by bringing these two discordant contexts together helps
   illuminate problems of injustice that must be confronted in the future
   as we move toward a more universal and equitable health care system in
   which conceptions of rights must have some place.}},

   shown commercial levels of fruit set in growing conditions of
   single-cultivar orchards, but incidence of late frosts is still damaging
   the crop in some inland growing regions in particular years. Selection
   G-2-25, coming from the cross `Felisia' x `Bertina', shows very good
   traits for a commercial cultivar, blooming in addition two weeks later
   than `Felisia', the latest blooming cultivar released so far. It is thus
   considered for registration because of its erect growth habit, early
   ripening, high and regular bloom density, autogamy (S6Sf genotype), high
   fruit set, tolerance to diseases, hard shell, large kernel, very high
   content of oleic acid, and medium content of tocopherol.}},

   pollinators such as Trigona biroi Friese, honeybees (Apis cerana

   2007. The relative abundance and foraging behavior of insect pollinators
   was also documented. Some aspects of the floral biology of mango were
   observed as it influenced pollinator foraging.
   A total of 21 insect species belonging to five orders visited mango
   flowers. The primary pollinators were stingless bees (Trigona biroi),
   calliphorids (Chrysomya spp.), syrphids (Eristalis spp.) and honey bees
   (Apis cerana and A. mellifera). Pollinators actively foraged from
   700-1059 h, with the peak period occurring at 800-859 h. The foraging
   activities of the pollinators synchronized with anthesis. Prior to the
   introduction of bee colonies in the mango farm, the fruit set in caged
   (2.13\%) and uncaged (3.34\%) inflorescences did not vary. After the
   introduction of bee colonies, the fruit set in the uncaged inflorescence
   (41\%) was significantly higher than that in the caged inflorescence
   (0.7\%). The terminal inflorescence, floral longevity (5 d) and scent,

Abstract = {{As suburban landscapes expand, it is critical to understand their
   capacity to support wildlife. Pollinators, specifically bees
   (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila), are to some degree compatible with
   urbanization and may be able to exist in suburbs in diverse assemblages.
   We surveyed 21 residential gardens for bees in Westchester County, a
   suburban area immediately north of New York City. From a sample of 1,675
   individuals, we documented 110 species, of which 95\% were native, 50\%
   were solitary, and 93\% were polylectic. In terms of abundance of
   specimens, eusocial (50\% of specimens), native (97\%), and polylectic
   (98\%) bees were dominant. Contrary to our expectation, based on
   previous bee surveys in urban landscapes, the bee community documented
   was not depauperate in either soil-nesting or parasitic species (65 and
   19\% of species, respectively), nor was it enriched in exotic species
   (6\% of species). Instead, the assemblage resembled the richer bee fauna
   documented at a 1,520-ha research preserve (forest) located in the same
   region, although certain specialist (oligolectic) and/or
   forest-associated species were absent. These results suggest that
   suburban landscapes in eastern North America have the potential to host
   relatively diverse and intact bee communities.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for preserving viable soft X-ray irradiated pollen for the
   production of seedless watermelons (Citrullus lanatus L.) from diploid
   plants was established by storing the pollen under N(2) at -25 degrees C
   for 1 year. Pollen stored at 4 degrees C had the ability to germinate
   until 28 days under all atmospheres tested except O(2). However, after
   storage at this temperature for 3 months it did not germinate in any
   treatment conditions. Pollen stored at -25 degrees C for 1 year under
   N(2), CO(2) or under a vacuum had a germination rate of about 50\%.
   Pollen stored in O(2) or in air had a much lower germination rate, less
   than 20\% and 10\%, respectively. Thus, it is important to store
   watermelon pollen at a low temperature when it is being stored for a
   long time. Nitrogen and CO(2) were effective in extending the life of
   watermelon pollen. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that the
   viability of pollen was reduced by storage under O(2). The N(2) and
   CO(2) are thought to be effective because they are essentially inert to
   the living pollen. Also, a lot of pollen tubes were observed in a middle
   portion of an ovary pollinated with pollen stored at -25 degrees C under
   N(2); however, pollen tubes were not observed in ovaries pollinated with
   pollen stored under a vacuum. It was revealed in 1 year storage
   experiments that viability of pollen stored under N(2) was higher than
   that stored under a vacuum. Seedless fruits produced with pollen stored
   at -25 degrees C under N(2) had the same characteristics as the control
   fruit.}},

   developed seeded fruit in open-pollinated situations, or when controlled
   cross-pollinations were made. One of these hybrids was used to
   demonstrate that wind was not a pollen vector. Glasshouse experiments
   confirmed the results obtained for some of the cultivars tested in the
   orchard. Variation in anther position relative to the stigma among five
   cultivars suggested that self- or auto-pollination can occur without

Abstract = {{The ability of hybrids from a cross between `Imperial' mandarin and
   `Ellendale' tangor to produce seedless fruit was evaluated over three
   seasons by imposing a series of pollination treatments at the time of
   flowering. These involved covering limbs with mesh bags before flowering
   occurred, emasculating and withholding pollen from flowers, or
   emasculating and self-pollinating flowers, then assessing the seediness
   of the fruit that developed along with similar fruit from
   open-pollinated flowers. Hybrids segregated for parthenocarpic ability
   in a ratio of 9:23 (chi(2) = 0.0008; ns), which favoured
   non-parthenocarpic hybrids and suggested the action of three dominant
   complementary genes. Variability in self-pollen reactions at the stigma
   indicated that the hybrids segregated for viable and non-functional
   pollen. Seedless fruit from self-pollinated flowers also suggested that
   the hybrids segregated for self-incompatibility. Variation between
   hybrids for floral characteristics concerning the presentation and
   availability of pollen in flowers, for which transgressive segregation
   was evident, was assessed in terms of the potential for self-pollination
   without vector intervention (auto-pollination). and the expression of
   parthenocarpy. The results are discussed in the context of selecting for

Abstract = {{The floral morphs of an invasive herb, Oxalis corniculata, were surveyed
   based on the examination of herbarium specimens deposited in IBSC, and
   field observation on living individuals in 24 natural populations in
   China. The floral phenology, pollen-ovule ratio (P/O) and floral
   visitors of O. corniculata were investigated and determined. Assisted
   pollination experiments were carried out to examine the breeding system
   of O. corniculata. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and fluorescence
   microscope (FM) were employed to examine pollen germination and the
   growth of pollen tubes. The species is composed of three floral morphs
   in China, viz., the long-styled morph, the semi-homostyled morph, and
   the quasi-homostyled morph. The semi-homostyled morph is common in
   disturbed urban and ruderal habitats, whereas only one long-styled
   population was found in less disturbed habitats of Pinus forests in
   Anning County, Yunnan Province, although two specimens (in IBSC) of
   long-styled individuals collected from a same locality in Guangdong
   Province were also recorded. The flowering period of O. corniculata was
   from February to November, with a peak at March to September; the
   longevity of a single flower was two days, and the petals closed at the
   first night and reopen in the next morning. Pollen grains were found on
   self-stigmata, and the pollen grains were germinating on the stigmata
   before the flower opening. The P/O was 83.3 +/- 3.08. Nectar secretion
   was observed but the volume was not large enough to be measured. A small
   butterfly (Pseudozizeeria sp.) was observed to visit the flowers of
   semi-homostyled plants, but its effectiveness as a pollinator was
   extremely low. Fruit set of untreated bagged flowers (88.12 +/- 3.38)
   was not significantly different from that of open flowers (88.03 +/-
   2.48). Fluorescence microscopic (FM) observations proved that pollen
   germinated on self-stigmata and pollen tubes grown in self-styles.
   Measurements of floral traits and results of manipulated pollination
   treatments indicated that the breeding system of semi-homostyled plants
   of the species is typical autogamy.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization is one of the most extreme forms of land transformation. It
   is supposed to change the frequencies of species trait states in species
   assemblages. We hypothesize that the flora of urban and rural areas
   differs in the frequency of trait states and ask which traits enable a
   plant to cope with the urban environment. We tested our hypothesis in
   Germany, which was divided into grid-cells of ca 130 km(2). We
   distinguished urbanized (with more than 33\% urban land use; n = 59),
   agricultural (with more than 50\% agricultural land use; n = 1365) and
   semi-natural (with more than 50\% forest and semi-natural land use; n =
   312) grid-cells and calculated the proportions of plant species per
   trait state in each grid-cell. Multiple linear regressions explained the
   log-transformed ratio of one proportion to another with land use (urban,
   agricultural, semi-natural) and the environmental parameters (climate,
   topography, soils and geology). Additionally, linear mixed effect models
   accounted for the effects of land use and biogeography and differences
   in sample size of the three grid-cell types. Urbanized and rural areas
   showed clear differences in the proportion of trait states. Urbanized
   grid-cells had e.g., higher proportions of wind-pollinated plants,
   plants with scleromorphic leaves or plants dispersed by animals, and
   lower proportions of insect-pollinated plants, plants with hygromorphic
   leaves or plants dispersed by wind than other grid-cells. Our study
   shows that shifts in land use can change the trait state composition of
   plant assemblages. Far-reaching urbanization might consequently
   homogenize our flora with respect to trait state frequency.}},

Abstract = {{The exotic tree Muntingia calabura L. (Muntingiaceae), a species native
   to Central America, is used as fish feed and fiber and cellulose
   production in Brazil. This study was carried out in urban areas and
   verified the reproductive biology of this plant species. Flower and
   fruit morphology, compatibility system, reproductive phenology,
   pollination and frugivore animals, and germination of disseminated seeds
   were recorded by standard field and laboratory procedures. This tree is
   self-compatible and autonomously self-pollinated, with its flowers being
   mainly visited by bees and its fruits consumed by birds and bats.
   Germination of its dispersed seeds is fast and occurs at a high rate.
   The results of this work suggest that M. calabura is very adaptable to
   cultivated areas, thus being an excellent choice for urban
   reforestation. However, its reproductive characteristics place this
   plant as an invasive species with significant potential in southeastern
   Brazil.}},

Abstract = {{Most, if not all, trees are outbreeding, highly heterozygous and undergo
   a long developmental period before reaching their reproductive stage.
   Classical breeding and cross-pollinating procedures are both
   unpredictable and time-consuming. In vitro androgenesis is, thus, the
   most prolific and desirable approach of haploid production. But various
   attempts to induce androgenic potential in the trees have met with
   rather limited success, as they ought to be extremely recalcitrant in
   culture. The success rate in this case is nowhere close to that achieved
   for some model species like Brassica and Nicotiana.
   Our review article intends to focus on the overview of androgenic
   process and all the major contributions till date on tree species with
   regard to this aspect. We wish to bring together in one place all the
   important variables used by different workers, that influence androgenic
   potential immensely like, stage of anther or microspore at culture,
   media composition, combinations and concentrations of growth regulators,
   and additives. This will prove to be a worthy guide to all the
   prospective workers in this area and in designing their experiments
   further. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLANT SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{175}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of gibberellic acid (GA(3)) in the
   fertilization of Clementine mandarin cv. `Clemenules'(Citrus clementina
   Hort. ex Tan.), a parthenocarpic variety that produces seedless fruit
   due to its self-incompatible nature, but yields seedy fruits when grown
   under cross-pollination conditions.
   Experiments were conducted with on-tree `Clemenules' flowers and
   `Fortune' mandarin pollen (C. clementina Hort. ex Tan. x C. reticulata
   Blanco), which is sexually compatible with the former. Preanthesis
   treatment at -2 days after anthesis (-2 DAA) enhanced ovule abortion in
   both unpollinated and cross-pollinated (at +2 DAA) flowers. In the
   latter, the number of pollen tubes reaching the ovules was significantly
   reduced although pollen grains were not treated: thus, fertilization was
   partially avoided and seed set was reduced. When GA(3) was applied at
   anthesis (0 DAA) at the time of pollination, ovule abortion was again
   enhanced, and pollen tube growth was completely arrested; thus,
   fertilization was prevented and seed set was impeded. When GA(3) was
   applied 24 h after pollination (+1 DAA in flowers pollinated at
   anthesis), pollen tube growth was impaired but not arrested and Ovule
   abortion was enhanced; therefore, fertilization was not prevented but
   impaired.
   We conclude that, when applied the days around anthesis, GA(3) (10 mg
   l(-1)) impairs fertilization by either enhancing ovule abortion or
   reducing pollen tube growth, in `Clemenules' flowers under
   cross-pollination conditions. The intensity of the response depends on
   the physiological flower state at the moment of treatment. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{Stingless bees represent one of the most diversified components of the
   natural Apoidea fauna of pollinators in the tropics. They use diverse
   kinds of substrates and inhabit varied habitats. Some species are
   typical for some natural either artificial place. The landscape
   alteration were this group of bees nests, has and important impact on
   the natural composition of its community structure, fact which is
   reflected in the nest density. We analyzed the structure composition of
   the stingless bees' community in three environments in the Colombian
   Ilanos piedmont, an important region that represents the transition
   between Andean ecosystems and a savannah that is seriously threatened by
   cattle practices. We made systematic samples in secondary forest,
   agro-ecosystems and urban areas, recording the presence of 204 nests
   from I I genera (24 species). The nest density per landscape was
   heterogeneous and never higher than 16 nests/Ha. We observed two nesting

Abstract = {{Male-sterile, female-fertile plants were used to produce hybrid soybean
   seed. Manual cross-pollination using male-sterile plants to produce
   large quantities of hybrid seed is difficult and time-consuming because
   of the low success rate in cross-pollination. Insect pollinators may be
   suitable vectors to transfer pollen, but the most suitable vector for
   pollen transfer from the male parent to the female parent has not been
   identified for soybean. The objective of the present study was to
   evaluate seed-set on four male-sterile, female-fertile soybean lines by
   using alfalfa leafcutting bees (Megachile rotundata (F.)) and honey bees
   (Apis mellifera (L.)) as pollinators. Seed-set was evaluated in summers
   2003 and 2005 near Ames, Iowa, USA and in summers 2003, 2004, and 2005
   near Wooster, Ohio, USA. Neither the effect of pollinator species nor
   the interaction effect of pollinator species x location was significant
   for any year. Honey bees performed similarly to alfalfa leafcutting bees
   at both locations. The results indicated significant differences for
   seed-set among male-sterile lines, suggesting preferential pollination.
   Male-sterile lines, ms1 (Urbana) and ms2 (Ames 2), had higher
   cross-pollinated seed-set compared to ms6 (Ames 1), and ms6 (Corsoy 79).
   At the Ames location, ms1ms1 (Urbana) plants had the highest seed-set
   (50.16 seeds per male-sterile plant in 2005). At the Wooster location,
   ms1ms1 (Urbana) plants also had the highest seed-set (92.04 seeds per
   male-sterile plant) in 2005. Costs and local conditions need to be
   addressed to support the choice of either pollinator species as a
   pollination vector to produce hybrid soybean seed.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic analyses were conducted with 51 parsimony-informative
   morphological characters and previously generated DNA sequence data from
   five genic regions (ITS, trnL-trnF, rpl16, matK, tranC-tranD) to revise
   the classification of Symplocaceae in accordance with ranked monophyly.
   Observed conflict between the morphological and molecular estimates is
   interpreted as a consequence of convergent features of-the and roecium
   among two clades of the family, possibly influenced by the advent of
   hummingbird pollination in the largest New World lineage. All nine taxa
   above the species level in the revised classification (two genera, and
   within symplocos two subgenera, three sections, and two series) are
   based oil clades with >= 90\% bootstrap support values and Bayesian
   posterior probabilities of 1.00 in molecular analyses. Symplocos section
   Cordyloblast (two species) is elevated to the genus level oil the basis
   of both its position as sister to all other Symplocos species zinc]
   morphological differences that have been used to delineate genera in
   other Ericalean families. Optimization of the morphological characters
   onto one of the trees from the combined morphological and molecular
   analysis Suggests that all nine recognized taxa correspond to clades

   these clades Support is provided by only ambiguous, characters. All 318
   Species of Symplocos, as Currently recognized in the literature, are
   assigned to Subdivisions. The assignment of 90 of these is based oil
   molecular and morphological data, and that of the rest (as yet unsampled
   for DNA sequence characters) oil morphological attributes alone. The
   ranks of two taxa are changed (to symplocos subgenus Pelura and
   Symplocos series Urbaniochciris), several lectotypes are designated, and
   a key to genera and Subdivisions of Symplocos, descriptions, and
   complete synonymy are provided.}},

Title = {{The risk of pollen-mediated gene flow from exotic Corymbia plantations

Abstract = {{Sectors of the forest plantation industry in Australia are set to expand
   in the near future using species or hybrids of the spotted gums
   (Corymbia, Section Politaria). Plantations of these taxa have already
   been introduced across temperate and subtropical Australia, representing
   locally exotic introductions from native stands in Queensland and New
   South Wales. A literature review was undertaken to provide insights into
   the potential for pollen-mediated gene flow from these plantations into
   native populations. Three factors suggest that such gene flow is likely;
   (1) interspecific hybridisation within the genus has frequently been
   recorded, including between distantly related species from different
   sections, (2) apparent high levels of vertebrate pollinator activity may
   result in plantation pollen being moved over hundreds of kilometres, (3)
   much of the plantation estate is being established among closely related
   taxa and therefore few barriers to gene flow are expected. Across
   Australia, 20 of the 100 native Corymbia taxa were found to have
   regional level co-occurrence with plantations. These were located most
   notably within regions of north-east New South Wales and south-east
   Queensland, however, co-occurrence was also found in south-west Western
   Australia and eastern Victoria. The native species found to have
   co-occurrence were then assessed for the presence of reproductive
   barriers at each step in the process of gene flow that may reduce the
   number of species at risk even further. The available data suggest three
   risk categories exist for Corymbia. The highest risk was for gene flow
   from plantations of spotted gums to native populations of spotted gums.
   This was based on the expected limited existence of pre- and
   post-zygotic barriers, substantial long-distance pollen dispersal and an
   apparent broad period of flowering in Corymbia citriodora subsp.
   variegata plantations. The following risk category focussed on gene flow
   from Corymbia torelliana x C. c. variegata hybrid plantations into
   native C. c. variegata, as the barriers associated with the production
   and establishment of F, hybrids have been circumvented. For the lowest
   risk category, Corymbia plantations may present a risk to other
   non-spotted gum species, however, further investigation of the
   particular cross-combinations is required. A list of research directions
   is provided to better quantify these risks. Empirical data will need to
   be combined within a risk assessment framework that will not only
   estimate the likelihood of exotic gene flow, but also consider the
   conservation status/value of the native populations. In addition, the
   potential impacts of pollen flow from plantations will need to be
   weighed up against their various economic and environmental benefits.

Abstract = {{Background and Aims The genus Gesneria diversified in the Greater
   Antilles giving rise to various floral designs corresponding to
   different pollination syndromes. The goal of this study was to
   characterize the pollination and breeding systems of five Puerto Rican
   Gesneria species.
   Methods The study was conducted in Arecibo and El Yunke National Forest,
   Puerto Rico, between 2003 and 2007. Floral visitors were documented by
   human observers and video cameras. Floral longevity and nectar
   production were recorded for the five study species. Tests for
   self-compatibility and autonomous selfing were conducted through
   hand-pollination and bagging experiments.
   Key Results Floral phenology and nectar production schedules agree with
   nocturnal (in bell-shaped flowered G. pedunculosa and G. viridiflora
   subsp. sintenisii) or diurnal pollination syndromes (in tubular-flowered
   G. citrina, G. cuneifolia and G. reticulata). Nectar concentration is
   consistently low (8-13\%) across species. Gesneria citrina and G.
   cuneifolia are exclusively pollinated by hummingbirds, while Gesneria
   reticulata relies mostly on autonomous self-pollination, despite having
   classic ornithophilous flowers. A variety of floral visitors was
   recorded for the two species with bell-shaped flowers; however, not all
   visitors have the ability to transfer pollen. Bats are the primary
   pollinators of G. pedunculosa, with bananaquits probably acting as
   secondary pollinators. For G. viridiflora subsp. sintenisii, both bats
   and hummingbirds contact the flower's reproductive organs, thus, this
   species is considered to be a generalist despite its nocturnal floral
   syndrome. All species are self-compatible but only tubular-flowered
   Gesneria are capable of autonomous self-pollination.
   Conclusions The visitation patterns described in this study fit the
   predicted hummingbird and bat pollination syndromes and support both
   specialization and generalization of pollination systems in Puerto Rican
   Gesneria. Specialization is associated with low pollinator visitation,
   particularly by hummingbirds, which may explain the occurrence of
   autonomous selfing mechanisms in tubular-flowered species.}},

   33\% (+/- 19.2) for E. cordata and 25\% (+/- 2.5) for E. nigrita. Only 7
   bees were sighted at a different site from where they were first
   captured. More than 75\% of the individuals showed site-constancy at
   trees for at least 30 days. Wing wear accumulation rate was variable
   among individuals and it was a poor predictor of age for E. cordata. Our
   data show that euglossine bees may have small foraging ranges in urban
   areas, indicating that home ranges greatly differ from their flight
   capacity and homing ability.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to study the wingless males of pollinating
   (Pegoscapus tonduzi) and two nonpollinating fig wasp species, genus
   Idarnes, associated with figs (Ficus citrifolia) in Brazil to answer the
   following questions: 1) Do wingless males of Idarnes spp. and P. tonduzi
   show different male-male competition strategies?; and, 2) Do the injury
   within-species variables correlate with fig/population features?
   Consistently higher injury levels were observed in the two species of
   Idarnes than in the pollinator species. The results suggested that
   aggressive confrontations were involved in the mating strategies of
   Idarnes, whereas non-aggressive strategies were shown by males of P.
   tonduzi. Generally, injury variables in Idarnes spp. correlated
   positively with the male encounter rate and negatively with the fig
   size, thus supporting the contest competition theory. The results
   pointed out that different species under similar local conditions might
   follow distinct evolutionary histories. Within species, natural-history
   particularities might have some influence upon quantified injury levels

Abstract = {{Because of the low availability of insects other than thrips as
   potential pollinators in arctic environments, early botanists of the
   twentieth century proposed that thrips pollination would be important in
   many plants, especially those of the Ericaceae family. However, this was
   an object of controversy that continues today. In this article, we
   combined experimental evidence and a broad regional survey to analyze
   the role of thrips in flower pollination of the Ericaceae
   Arctostaphyllos uva-ursi. We conducted exclusion experiments, nectar
   measures, and observation of thrips in plants during 2 yr at four
   populations in southwestern Europe. We found that flower pollination by
   thrips seems to be a common element in the studied populations of A.
   uva-ursi that accounts for similar to 20\% of the total pollination. We
   found seven species of thrips visiting the flowers of similar to 50\% of
   the individuals of A. uva-ursi. The most abundant species were
   Ceratothrips ericae, previously cited as a potential pollinator of many
   Ericaceae in northern Europe, and Haplothrips setiger, a widely
   distributed Mediterranean Phlaeothripidae commonly cited in flowers of
   Asteraceae. We also discuss the role of spontaneous self-pollination in
   the reproductive success of A. uva-ursi and nectar consumption by
   thrips.}},

Title = {{Do alien plants on Mediterranean islands tend to invade different niches

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{703-716}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand invasions, it is important to know how alien
   species exploit opportunities in unfamiliar ecosystems. For example, are
   aliens concentrated in niches under-exploited by native communities, or
   widely distributed across the ecological spectrum? To explore this
   question, we compared the niches occupied by 394 naturalized alien
   plants with a representative sample from the native flora of
   Mediterranean islands. When niche structure was described by a
   functional group categorization, the distribution of native and alien
   species was remarkably similar, although ``succulent shrubs{''} and
   ``trees with specialized animal pollination mechanisms{''} were
   under-represented in the native species pool. When niche structure was
   described by Grime's CSR strategy, the positioning of aliens and natives
   differed more strongly. Stress-tolerance was much rarer amongst the
   aliens, and a competitive strategy was more prevalent at the habitat
   level. This pattern is similar to previous findings in temperate Europe,
   although in those regions it closely reflects patterns of native
   diversity. Stressed environments are much more dominant in the
   Mediterranean. We discuss a number of factors which may contribute to
   this difference, e.g., competitive and ruderal niches are often
   associated with anthropogenic habitats, and their high invasibility may
   be due partly to introduction patterns rather than to a greater
   efficiency of aliens at exploiting them. Thus far, the reasons for
   invasion success amongst introduced species have proved difficult to
   unravel. Despite some differences, our evidence suggests that alien
   species naturalize across a wide range of niches. Given that their
   ecologies therefore vary greatly, one may ask why such species should be
   expected to share predictable traits at all?.}},

Title = {{Cryptic species diversity in a widespread bumble bee complex revealed

Journal = {{CONSERVATION GENETICS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{653-666}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Cryptic species diversity is thought to be common within the class
   Insecta, posing problems for basic ecological and population genetic
   studies and conservation management. Within the temperate bumble bee
   (Bombus spp.) fauna, members of the subgenus Bombus sensu stricto are
   amongst the most abundant and widespread. However, their species
   diversity is controversial due to the extreme difficulty or inability
   morphologically to identify the majority of individuals to species. Our
   character-based phylogenetic analyses of partial CO1 (700 bp) from 39
   individuals spread across their sympatric European ranges provided
   unequivocal support for five taxa (3-22 diagnostic DNA base pair sites
   per species). Inclusion of 20 Irish specimens to the dataset revealed >=
   2.3\% sequence divergence between taxa and <= 1.3\% within taxa. We
   developed a PCR-RFLP based method for unequivocally distinguishing
   amongst the four cryptic European taxa of this subgenus, B. cryptarum,
   B. lucorum, B. magnus and B. terrestris, and used it to analyse 391
   females of the former three species collected across Ireland, all of
   which could be unambiguously assigned to species. Bombus lucorum was the
   most widely distributed and abundant of the cryptarum-lucorum-magnus
   species complex, comprising 56\% of individuals, though it was
   significantly less abundant at higher altitudes (> 200 m) whilst B.
   cryptarum was relatively more abundant at higher altitudes. Bombus
   magnus was rarely encountered at urban sites. Both B. lucorum and B.
   terrestris are nowadays reared commercially for pollination and
   transported globally. Our RFLP approach to identify native fauna can
   underpin ecological studies of these important cryptic species as well
   as the impact of commercial bumble bees on them.}},

Title = {{Wild bee pollinators provide the majority of crop visitation across

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{793-802}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Concern about a global decline in wild pollinators has increased
   interest in how pollinators are affected by human land use, and how
   this, in turn, affects crop pollination.
   2. We measured wild bee visitation to four summer vegetable crops, and
   investigated associations between flower visitation rates and land-use
   intensity at local and landscape scales. We studied 29 farms in New
   Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA. Over 2 years we recorded > 7400 bee visits
   to crop flowers and identified 54 species of wild bees visiting crops.
   3. Wild bees were the dominant flower visitors at three of the four
   crops studied; domesticated honeybees, Apis mellifera L., provided the
   remainder of visits.
   4. Ordination of the two best studied crops showed that the wild bee
   species visiting tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L., were distinct from
   those visiting watermelon, Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. \& Nakai.
   5. Crop visitation by wild bees was not associated with organic farming,
   nor with natural habitat cover at either local or landscape scale.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The extent of crop visitation by wild
   bees observed in this study is among the highest recorded. In contrast
   to previous studies of crop visitation by wild bees, we did not find
   negative effects of conventional farming or natural habitat loss. In our
   study system, organic and conventional farms differ little in field
   size, crop diversity and weedy flower diversity, unlike some systems
   where organic farms have smaller fields with greater crop and weed
   diversity. Such variables may be more important than organic vs.
   conventional farming practices. Second, small patches of natural habitat
   are dispersed throughout our entire study system, and this habitat
   heterogeneity may support high bee abundance even in landscapes with a
   low proportion of natural habitat overall. Our findings suggest that
   agri-environment schemes and similar programmes that work through local
   habitat restoration should target farms in intensively agricultural
   (homogeneous) landscapes to gain maximum conservation benefits.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to observe and describe the feeding habits and
   available food resources of the swallow-tailed hummingbird, Eupetomena
   macroura. The study was carried out in a municipal park located in the
   city of Taubate, in the state of Sao Paulo. The observations took place
   between December 2003 and October 2004, recording the following
   variables: 1) the plant species visited for feeding and territorial
   defense; 2) the kinds of food resources; and 3) the kinds of flight to
   procure and obtain food. E. macroura visited 12 plant species. For
   territorial defense, Mangifera indica was the most visited, whereas
   Malvaviscus arboreus was most visited for feeding. The foliage was the
   plant part that received the most frequent visits. In order to obtain
   nectar, the only species visited was M. arboreus; to obtain arthropods,
   the species most visited were Mangifera indica and Hymenaea stilbocarpa.
   In the dry season, the hummingbirds visited flowers, whereas in the
   rainy season they visited leaves to acquire food. The arthropod groups
   most frequently found on leafy branches were Homoptera. and Psocoptera.
   Finally, the results of the type of flight analysis showed that flight
   used to capture food was more often observed than were flights to search
   for food. In conclusion, these observations suggest that E. macroura
   shows plasticity in feeding behavior, which can help it to persist in
   urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{A decline in pollination function has been linked to agriculture
   expansion and intensification. In northwest Argentina, pollinator visits
   to grapefruit, a self-compatible but pollinator-dependent crop, decline
   by approximately 50\% at 1 km from forest edges. We evaluated whether
   this decrease in visitation also reduces the pollination service in this
   crop. We analysed the quantity and quality of pollen deposited on
   stigmas, and associated limitation of fruit production at increasing
   distances ( edge: 10, 100, 500 and 1000 m) from the remnants of Yungas
   forest. We also examined the quantitative and qualitative efficiency of
   honeybees as pollen vectors. Pollen receipt and pollen tubes in styles
   decreased with increasing distance from forest edge; however, this
   decline did not affect fruit production. Supplementation of natural
   pollen with self- and cross-pollen revealed that both pollen quantity
   and quality limited fruit production. Despite pollen limitation,
   honeybees cannot raise fruit production because they often do not
   deposit sufficient high-quality pollen per visit to elicit fruit
   development. However, declines in visitation frequency well below seven
   visits during a flower's lifespan could decrease production beyond
   current yields. In this context, the preservation of forest remnants,
   which act as pollinator sources, could contribute to resilience in crop
   production. Like wild plants, pollen limitation of the yield among
   animal-pollinated crops may be common and indicative not only of
   pollinator scarcity, but also of poor pollination quality, whereby
   pollinator efficiency, rather than just abundance, can play a broader
   role than previously appreciated.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-pollination was performed with soft-X-irradiated hyuga-natsu
   pollens (1000 Gy) for `Tosa-Buntan' pummelo (Citrus grandis (L.)
   Osbeck). This resulted in the transformation of large and complete seeds
   into small and empty ones (practically seedless). Although fruit set,
   fruit retention, total soluble solids content (TSS) and titratable
   acidity of the juice were not affected, decrement in the fruit size was
   observed. Two weeks after the pollination, endosperm cell division with
   free nuclei began in both the non-irradiated and irradiated pollen
   treatment conditions. Seven weeks after pollination, endosperm division
   with the cell wall occurred in the non-irradiated pollen treatment
   conditions; however, the endosperm development ceased in most ovules
   that underwent the irradiated pollen treatment, and the ovules remained
   in their free nuclear stage. The delayed degeneration of the ovules,
   following successful fertilization and commencement of endosperm cell
   division, allow these seedless fruits to be categorized as
   pseudo-parthenocarpic. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial development and consumption of petroleum products leads to
   increase air pollution levels especially in urban and industrial areas.
   Heavy metal components associated with air pollutants have far reaching
   effects with respect to economic and ecological importance of pollens.
   The pollens are male reproductive organs of the plant and travel through
   air from flower to flower for pollination purpose. During this period
   they are exposed to air pollutants. Present investigation thus pertains
   to study of effect of air pollutants on pollens especially biosorption
   and bioaccumulation of heavy metals. The pollens of three commonly
   occurring plants namely Cassia siamea, Cyperus rotundus, Kigelia pinnata
   have been studied from the NH-6 of Nagpur city, India. The pollens
   exposed to polluted air showed the presence of higher concentrations of
   Ca, Al and Fe as compared to unexposed pollens. Higher concentration of
   these metals was observed in Cyperus rotundus followed by Cassia siamea
   and Kigelia pinnata. These results indicate that pollens act as good
   indicator of air pollution giving results in short time of exposure of
   5-10 h. Apart from this, it is also reported that some of these metals
   play crucial role in the metabolic activity in pollens for example
   Calcium is necessary for growth of pollen tube and other metabolic
   activities in pollens. The presence of these metals in pollens may also
   enhance the allergenicity of the pollens. Similarly accumulation of
   heavy metals may also deteriorate the quality of pollen for their
   economical use. The viability of pollen is also affected by these
   pollutants in sensitive species leading to impairment of their
   fertility.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination effectiveness was evaluated for pollen (pollinia) from two
   Dendrobium hybrids, `Sena Red' and `Mini WRL', submitted to

   included pollinia exposure to a previtrification solution (PVS2) under
   ice (0 degrees C) or room (27 +/- 2 degrees C) temperatures from 1 to 4
   hours before cryopreservation (LN). On removal from cryopreservation,
   pollinia were used to pollinate flowers of the same hybrids to verify
   viability and germination. All pollinia showed high percentages of
   germination (greater than 80\%) after crosses were performed, except for
   pollinia from Dendrobium `Sena Red' submitted to 3 hours of precooling
   (0 degrees C) in PVS2 followed by LN (60\%) and for pollinia submitted
   to PVS2 for 3 hours at room temperature with no precooling (70\%).
   Capsules were formed for both hybrids and seeds were successfully
   produced. The seed viability test revealed high viability (90\% to 95\%)
   for all treatments for both hybrids. Seeds observed under a microscope
   contained well-formed embryos and no abnormalities were identified.
   Seeds from all treatments germinated. Germinating seeds developed into
   healthy seedlings with well-formed leaves and roots. Cryopreservation of
   pollinia was successfully accomplished either by direct storage in
   liquid nitrogen without cryoprotection treatments or by using a PVS2

Abstract = {{We describe the richness, abundance, and ecological characteristics of
   bees in community gardens located in heavily developed neighborhoods of
   the Bronx and East Harlem, NY. In total, 1,145 individual bees,
   representing 54 species (13\% of the recorded New York State bee fauna),
   were collected over 4 yr. The nesting habits of these species include
   bees that nest in cavities (33\% of species), hives (11\% of species),
   pith (1.9\% of species),wood (1.9\% of species), or soft/rotting wood
   (7.4\% of species) substrates. Soil-nesting individuals were relatively
   rare (25\% of individuals), perhaps due to a lack of proper soils for
   nesting sites. Parasitic species were scarce (5.6\% of species, 2.6\% of
   individuals), most likely because of an absence or rarity of host
   species. Overall, exotic species were abundant and constituted 27\% of
   the total individuals collected and 19\% of the identified species. We
   compare these results to several bee faunal surveys in New Jersey and
   New York State, including newly reported species lists for Central Park
   and Prospect Park in New York City. Relative to other studies, bee
   richness of the urban gardens is reduced and composition is biased
   toward exotic and cavity-nesting species. Nevertheless, despite their
   small size and location within highly urbanized areas, urban community
   gardens harbor a diverse assemblage of bees that may provide pollination
   services and opportunities for ecological exposure and education.}},

   worldwide. Samples of insect visitors on Zamia cones of either gender
   and at various stages of anthesis strongly suggest that P. portophylla
   is the primary and sole pollinator of these cycad species at the two
   locations. The abundance of adult individuals was much lower on the
   receptive megastrobili than on the pollen-releasing microstrobili which
   produced similar attracting odors. Larval development was restricted to
   the microstrobili, possibly indicating the presence of defensive
   metabolites in the megastrobili and a reproductive interaction with
   ``pollination by deceit{''}.}},

Abstract = {{An effective long-term storage method for active soft X-ray irradiated
   pollen for the production of seedless watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) in
   diploid plants by using gas treatments is described. Soft X-ray
   irradiated pollen stored under N-2 or CO2 gas, or under a vacuum for 1
   year had high pollen germination abilities. Also, pollen stored at -25
   degrees C under N-2 gas for 1 year and mixed with an equal amount of
   `Marriage powder' had similar results in the fruit produced. This result
   indicated that `Marriage powder' was useful as a pollen extender medium
   for watermelon. Soft X-ray irradiated pollen was stored at -25 degrees C
   for about 1 week, after which the pollen was set in an incubator at 20,
   25, 30, 35, or 40 degrees C under 50, 60, or 80\% relative humidity for
   1 to 6 hours. It is suitable to use pollen that is stored at a low

Abstract = {{Since the earliest times fragrant materials have been used in rituals.
   Today, a lucrative industry has developed to produce and deliver
   fragrances and aromatic chemicals with various applications in modern
   society. Linalool, a much sought after compound in the flavor and
   fragrance industry is a monoterpene alcohol which occurs naturally in
   many aromatic plants. Linalool and linalool-rich essential oils are
   known to exhibit various biological activities such as antimicrobial,
   anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-oxidant properties and several in
   vivo studies have confirmed various effects of linalool on the central
   nervous system. The applications of linalool are not confined to simply
   adding or enhancing a specific scent to domestic products such as soaps,
   detergents and shampoos. Linalool also plays an import role in nature as
   a key compound in the complex pollination biology of various plant
   species to ensure reproduction and survival. Linalool is also a key
   compound for the industrial production of a variety of fragrance
   chemicals such as geraniol, nerol, citral and its derivatives, as well
   as a lead compound in the synthesis of vitamins A and E. The repellent
   properties of linalool on various crop-destroying insects has been well
   documented accentuating the application of this molecule in eco-friendly
   pest management. This review aims to highlight the various biological
   properties of linalool and to emphasize the value of linalool and
   linalool-rich essential oils in phytotherapy.}},

Pages = {{275-281}},
Abstract = {{In urban environments, the green areas often are used for human
   recreational activities, which increase notably during weekends,
   inducing cyclic changes in wildlife activity. Potential pollinators are
   influenced by the number of flowers, the quantity and quality of nectar,
   the density and connectivity of plants, and habitat characteristics.
   However, the temporal dynamics of human activities is also likely to
   influence visitation rates. In this study, I analyzed the spatial and
   temporal variation of nectar feeding by a population of House Sparrows
   (Passer domesticus) on a public garden of Aloe arborescens plants
   located on a recreational area along the coast of Mar del Plata City
   (Argentina). During the weekends there was an increase in vehicle and
   pedestrian traffic and a decrease in the number of visits by the House
   Sparrows to. A. arborescens. Spatially, the number of visits by House
   Sparrows on A. arborescens was positively correlated with the number of
   inflorescences during both weekend days and working days, but during
   weekend days also was correlated negatively with the distance between
   plants. These results suggest that there are weekly cycles in the
   nectarivory levels of House Sparrows, highlighting the importance of
   analyzing the effects of human disturbance in urban environments.}},

Abstract = {{The use of artificial feeders has grown as a result of people wanting to
   attract hummingbirds to their yards. This has caused an increase in the
   density, and diversity of these birds in urban and suburban habitats.
   Feeders represent a bonanza for hummingbirds but also can represent a
   decrease in the number of hummingbirds visiting native plants. In the
   present study, we document changes in diversity and abundance of
   hummingbirds inhabiting a suburban park at the south of Mexico City, and
   experimentally assessed the effect of artificial feeders on visits and
   seed production of two native plant species. Feeding activity of the
   hummingbirds increased in the transects where feeders were available for
   one year, but the number of bird species did not differ between
   transects. Visit rates to plants were reduced by the presence of
   feeders, and only for Salvia fulgens was seed production lower in the
   plants located near feeders. S. mexicana was visited by hummingbirds but
   also by native bees that were not attracted by feeders, thus possibly
   compensating for the reduction in the-hummingbird visits, and so in
   pollination efficiency. Feeders can have a positive effect, on
   hummingbirds but can have an indirect one reducing visits, and thus
   pollination of native plants. However, the increase in hummingbird
   abundances can produce a compensatory effect that neutralizes the
   negative effect over the plants.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main restrictions in the production of watermelon (Citrullus

   sp. niveum (Fon). Soil disinfections were commonly used by farmers
   without obtaining satisfactory results and the use of watermelon
   cultivars with resistance to F. oxysporum were not efficient in heavily
   infected soils. In 1985, with the marketing of Japanese hybrids, began
   the use of grafted watermelon, which continues to date with excellent
   results. Therefore in areas like Almeria and Valencia, more than 95\% of
   the watermelon grown is grafted. The trial was conducted in a typical
   ``parral{''} greenhouse at Almeria, Spain. Triploid watermelon cv. Reina
   de Corazones grafted plants were grown without honeybee pollination,
   cultivated on artificial cover soil and fruit induction with 200 ppm of
   CPPU {[}1-(2-Cloro-4-piridi)-3-fenilurea]. The highest production values
   were obtained with the combination of `Reina de Corazones' scion with
   Citrullus lanatus, Lagenaria siceraria or the inter-specific hybrid
   RS841 (Cucurbita maxima x Cucurbita moschata) rootstock. These
   rootstocks didn't have rooting and incompabilities problems. Sycios
   angulatus, called cucumber star (Lee, 2003), showed incompatibility
   problems and C. mosehata showed poor rooting. These rootstocks produced
   the lowest yield. The rootstocks RS841, C mosehata, C. lanatus and

   different methods (adhesive traps and direct standardized field
   observations) to assess the colonization sequence of a diverse fig wasp
   fauna associated with Ficus citrifolia, section Americana, in Brazil.
   They consistently showed a temporal partitioning in colonization among
   non-pollinating fig wasp species. Idarnes species belonging to the
   flavicollis and incerta groups colonized figs just before or during the
   fig receptive phase. In contrast, Idarnes females belonging to the carme
   group oviposited one to three weeks later, mainly in the middle of the
   inter-floral phase. Eurytoma, Heterandrium, Physothorax and Torymus were
   later colonizers, and laid eggs either in the middle or during the late

Abstract = {{The segregation of 141 polymorphic expressed sequence tag-simple
   sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers in an F1 intergeneric citrus
   population was studied to build the first extensive EST maps for the
   maternal sweet orange and paternal Poncirus genomes. Of these markers,
   122 were found segregating in sweet orange, 59 in Poncirus, and 40 in
   both. Eleven linkage groups with 113 markers in sweet orange, 8 with 45
   markers in Poncirus, and 13 with 123 markers in the cross pollinator
   (CP) consensus of both, were constructed. About 775.8 cM of sweet orange
   genome and 425.7 cM of Poncirus genome were covered. Through comparison
   of shared markers, three cases were found where two linkage groups in
   one map apparently were colinear with one group of the other map;
   Poncirus linkages Ar1a and Ar1b and consensus linkages CP1a and CP1b,
   were both collinear with one sweet orange linkage, Sal, as were sweet
   orange Sa3a and Sa3b with Poncirus Ar3 and consensus CP3, and sweet
   orange Sa7a and Sa7b, and consensus CP7a and CP7b with Poncirus Ar7.
   These EST-SSR markers are particularly useful for constructing
   comparative framework maps for related genera because they amplify
   orthologous genes to provide anchor points across taxa. All SSR primers
   are freely available to the citrus community.}},

Abstract = {{Climate-based models simulating the growth, development, and potential
   productivity of sour cherry have been developed in order to determine
   the impacts of climate in past and projected future time frames on
   production areas in the Great Lakes region of the USA. A model of the
   phenological development of sour cherry flower buds was developed driven
   by growing degree-day accumulations estimated from maximum and minimum
   temperature. An empirical yield function was also developed from
   historical production data available for western Lower Michigan for the
   period 1982-2001. Following the examination of many potential
   climate-related influences, three factors were identified as primary
   determinants of yield: winter/cold injury, number of wet days during
   pollination, and the amount of precipitation preceding the end of the
   previous growing season. Time series of growth and yield were simulated
   at three sites across the region for historical time frames while for
   projected future time frames only preliminary analysis of growth and
   development were attempted. The simulations for the historical period
   suggest that phenological development (i.e., spring development) has
   occurred earlier in the last decades and that regional yields have been
   rather stable over time with only a slight increase in the last couple
   of decades. Projected future temperature scenarios suggest that the
   percentage of viable flower buds after last spring frost will be
   comparable to the present. However, the range of possible outcomes from
   the different scenarios suggests a much larger window of possibilities
   (i.e., varying from -70\% to +30\% of viable flowers in the northwest
   location of Maple City).}},

Abstract = {{This biotic inventory will document the species-level of dynastine
   scarabs, their spatial and temporal distributions, ecological
   preferences, and biology. The long term, multi-country research project
   explores a biotically megadiverse region that is seriously at risk from
   deforestation, environmental homogenization, invasive species, and urban
   sprawl. Objectives of this survey are: 1) to understand the biodiversity
   of dynastine scarab beetles in Mesoamerica; 2) disseminate this
   information in print and electronic forms; 3) train students,
   parataxonomists, and collection managers in the study area about
   dynastine taxonomy and identification, care of collections,
   dissemination of information, and conservation; and 4) assemble
   authoritatively identified voucher collections and associated databases
   in Mexico, Guatemala and the U.S. It fully complements our recently
   completed inventories of the dynastines in southern Mesoamerica. The
   electronic database and monograph will make information available to a
   broad user community of researchers, students, natural resource
   managers, government entities, and general public. Broader impacts of
   this research encompass discovery while promoting learning, solidifying
   partnerships to explore biodiversity, and enhancement of research
   infrastructure by creation/ augmentation/dissemination of databases,
   training of students and technicians, and establishment of
   authoritatively identified collections. Benefits to society include a
   better understanding of the importance of and threats to biodiversity,
   enhanced ability to monitor habitats using taxonomic knowledge,
   educating students and the public about science, training future
   scientists or technicians, and instilling in the peoples of developing
   tropical countries a greater interest in their own rich biota so they
   may benefit from it and better care for it.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between Ficus (Moraceae) and fig wasps is considered one
   of the most extreme examples of plant-insect mutualism. In the present
   study, we reported the fig wasp fauna associated with five Ficus species
   in the Central Amazon, Brazil, and considered some aspects of the
   pollination mode found in Ficus (Urostigma) cremersii, Ficus (Urostigma)
   greiffiana, Ficus (Urostigma) mathewsii, Ficus (Urostigma) pertusa e
   Ficus (Pharmacosycea) maxima. The study was carried out from April to
   July 2004, in the cities of Manaus and Presidente Figueiredo (state of
   Amazonas, Brazil). The number of fig wasp species per host tree varied
   from one to 13. Wasps of the genus Pegoscapus Cameron, 1906, pollinators
   of Ficus (Urostigma) spp., showed an active pollination mode. Indeed,
   these species have coxal combs and pollen pockets to collect and
   transport pollen. Tetrapus Mayr, 1885 species, pollinators of Ficus
   (Pharmacosycea) spp., demonstrated a passive pollination mode and they
   do not show morphological traits adapted to collect and transfer pollen
   grains. Besides fig wasps, E (Pharmacosycea) maxima and E (Urostigma)
   pertusa are associated with mites, ants (Solenopsis sp., Formicidae),
   beetles (Staphylinidae) and larvae of Diptera and Lepidoptera.}},

Abstract = {{The Callery pear (Pyrus calleryana Dcne. {[}Rosales: Rosaceae]), an
   Ornamental tree from China, has begun appearing in disturbed areas
   throughout the United States. To understand the relatively recent spread
   of this species into natural areas, we review its horticultural history,
   the traits promoting its invasiveness, and its current invasive status.
   Cultivated varieties (cultivars) of this species sold in the United
   States originate from different areas in China and represent genotypes
   that have been planted in high densities in residential and commercial
   areas in the introduced range. The species cannot self-pollinate because
   of a self-incomipatibility system, but recent fruit set is due to
   crossing between different cultivars or between the scion and rootstock
   of cultivated individuals. Consequently, individual cultivars themselves
   are not invasive, but the combination of cultivars within an area
   creates a situation in which invasive plants can be produced. Because of
   the established nature of this species in urban areas, the spread of
   wild P. calleryana will most likely continue, especially as new
   cultivars continue to be introduced into the mixture of cultivars
   already present.}},

Abstract = {{Field tests were conducted in 2004 and 2006 in Tifton, GA to document
   the effect of Meloidogyne incognita infection on watermelon yield.
   Experiments had 24 replications of two treatments: methyl bromide
   fumigated and non-fumigated. Each plot consisted of one row of nine
   plants: the first, fifth, and ninth plants in the row were pollinators
   (cv. Companion), and the other six plants were cv. Cooperstown seedless
   watermelons. Neither maximum vine length nor vigor rating three weeks
   after transplanting differed between methyl bromide-treated plots and
   non-treated plots in 2004. Both `Cooperstown' and `Companion'
   watermelons had significantly greater galling in non-fumigated plots
   than in the ftimigated plots in both years. The level of galling on
   `Companion' generally was the same as that on `Cooperstown'.
   Significantly more fruit and greater total weight were harvested from
   methyl bromide-fumigatcd plots in both 2004 and 2006 due to more fruit
   and greater weight being harvested during the first harvest; fruit
   number and weight were not different between fumigated and non-fumigated
   plots for the second harvest in either year. Nematode parasitism reduced
   the weight of the first harvest by 30\% in 2004 and 24\% in 2006.
   Fumigation increased yields by increasing the number of fruit during the
   first harvest but not the weight of individual fruit.}},

   involved in abnormal embryo sacs and unfertilized ovules. In seedy
   cultivars and lines, embryos developed to the cotyledon stage by 14

   embryos only developed to the early stages of zygote or embryo
   development. These results indicate that the seedless expression of the

Title = {{Silk abscission in two sweet corn (Zea mays L.) hybrids that differ in
   susceptibility to common smut infection of ears}},

Abstract = {{Host resistance is the most efficient way to control common smut
   (Ustilago maydis) in sweet corn, but resistance to U. maydis is not
   understood well. All meristematic tissues are susceptible, but infection
   is localized. Ear galls result from infection of ovaries. Infection and
   resistance can be affected by plant morphology. For example, ovaries are
   protected from U. maydis infection when an abscission zone forms at the
   base of the silk 6-24 h after a pollen tube reaches an ovary. The
   objective of this study was to determine if the rate of silk abscission
   differed between two related sweet corn hybrids that differed in
   susceptibility to smut infection of ears. The two hybrids, Green Giant
   Code 3 (GG3) and Green Giant Code 46 (GG46), were evaluated for the
   occurrence of infected ears in 58 paired plots at four locations near Le
   Sueur, MN, from 1993 to 1999. The rate of silk abscission in the two
   hybrids was evaluated in two field trials in Urbana, IL, in 2002 and
   2004. Incidence and severity of ear smut were significantly (P < 0.05)
   greater and about twice as much on GG3 than on GG46. Silk abscission was
   more rapid on GG46 than on GG3. Although this association does not prove
   that decreased susceptibility of GG46 to ear infection is due to silk
   abscission, it is a logical basis from which to hypothesize that silk
   dynamics and other aspects of maize floral biology play important roles
   in resistance to ear infection by minimizing the time period that all
   ovaries on an ear are exposed to infection by U. maydis. This hypothesis
   is discussed in relation to the results of this and other research.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is a worldwide concern about anthropogenic, causes of
   pollinator declines, little is known about how specific land use
   practices, such as agriculture, urbanization, and logging, influence the
   diversity and abundance of native bees. We investigated the impact of
   logging on native bees (Apoidea) in the Adirondack Mountains of New York
   State (USA) in an area isolated from the effects of both agriculture and
   introduced honey bees. Specifically, we measured midsummer bee abundance
   and diversity on matched 5-acre plots two and three years after
   experimental logging cuts to remove 30, 60, and 100\% of the trees. We
   obtained additional data on floral abundance and weather in relation to
   bee abundance. We found that bee abundance and diversity was highest in
   areas where the most trees had been removed. Also, we found little
   difference in diversity between the two study years, despite major
   differences in weather. The observed diversity patterns were best
   explained by the observed increase in abundance of flowering plants such
   as Rubus and Solidago. Despite the overall relationship between logging
   and bee diversity, the abundance of four species of Lasioglossum were
   significantly greater in the 60\% tree removal plot than the 100\%
   removal clear cut. Overall, our results suggest that a small-scale tree
   removal within a northern hardwood forest increases diversity and
   abundance of many bee species in the short term.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of non-pollinating fig wasps over fig-fig wasp mutualism.
   Mutualism is the name given to interspecific interactions which result
   in benefit for all partners involved. However, such cooperation is open
   to opportunistic strategies: individuals that extract the benefit from
   the partner, but do not offer any benefit in exchange. The fig-fig wasp
   interaction is an appropriate case to study mutualistic interactions and
   opportunistic strategies (parasites of mutualism). Plants of the genus
   Ficus maintain a mutualistic interaction with tiny pollinating wasps
   (Agaonidae) and are exploited by other non-pollinating fig wasp species.
   This study aimed to assess the effect of non-pollinating wasps over the
   mutualistic relation between Ficus citrifolia (Moraceae) and its
   pollinator Pegoscapus tonduzi Grandi, 1919 (Hymenoptera, Agaonidae). We
   compared both seed (female plant function) and pollinating female (male
   plant function) production rates among samples of high- and low-infested
   figs by non-pollinating wasps, sampled in three Brazilian cities,
   Londrina (state of Parana), Campinas and Ribeir (a) over tildeo Preto
   (state of S (a) over tildeo Paulo), Brazil. Our results have shown a
   negative impact over both female and male floral reproductive
   components. This effect was higher on the male plant component
   (production of pollinating females). Pollinator production was
   approximately seven times lower in infested figs, whereas seed
   production was 1.5 times lower in those figs. We discuss hypotheses
   about mutualism stability with the occurrence of opportunistic species.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Several studies have investigated the association between
   pollen exposure and asthma emergency admissions, but only 2 have
   investigated the effect of airborne allergens on consultations for
   rhinitis or conjunctivitis and none has used drug consumption as the
   health indicator.
   Objective: To analyze the short-term association between pollen exposure
   and antiallergic drug consumption in the urban area of Clermont-Ferrand,
   France, taking into account the potentially confounding effect of air
   pollution and meteorological factors.
   Methods: We used the French health insurance database to select all
   individuals from the Clermont-Ferrand urban area having benefited from
   reimbursement for antiallergic treatment from January 1, 2000, through
   December 31, 2001, and from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2004.
   An episode of treated allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitus, or
   conjunctivitis (ARC) was defined as the association of an oral
   antihistamine and a local antiallergic drug on the same prescription.
   The relations between daily changes in pollen concentrations and daily
   changes in the number of treated ARC cases were analyzed using a Poisson
   regression model with penalized spline functions.
   Results: The risk of treated ARC associated with an interquartile
   increase in pollen concentration increased significantly for Poaceae
   (5\%, P <.001), Fraxinus (7\%, P <.001), Betula (7\%, P <.001), and
   Corylus (2\%, P <.02). This increase was significant in all age groups
   for Poaceae and Fraxinus pollen and in people younger than 65 years for
   Betula pollen. The effect was mainly concentrated on the present day,
   except for Poaceae pollens, for which the risk remained significantly (P
   <.001) increased until 3 days lag time.
   Conclusions: This study showed a significant increase in treated ARC
   cases related to Poaceae, Fraxinus, and Betula. Specific risks are
   difficult to evaluate for species that share the same pollination
   period. Time-series studies based on drug consumption are useful to
   highlight and to supervise pollen-related diseases requiring ambulatory
   care.}},

Abstract = {{Intergeneric sexual hybridizations were conducted between two genera of
   Rutaceae, with Satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc) and Red tangerine
   (C. reticulata Blanco) as maternal parents, and Poncirus trifoliata (L.)
   Raf as the paternal parent, in an effort to generate hybrid populations
   for both molecular mapping and rootstock breeding. Embryo rescue is
   important for citrus sexual breeding because polyembryony can interfere
   with hybrid embryo recovery. Immature embryos of 80, 85, 90 days after
   pollination (DAP) from the Satsuma mandarin (S) x trifoliate orange (P)
   cross, 80 and 85 DAP from the Red tangerine (R) x trifoliate orange (P)
   cross, were cultured on MG1.0 medium consisting of MT basal medium
   supplemented with 1.0 mg l(-1) GA(3) and 4\% sucrose. The results showed
   that 80 DAP was the optimal time for embryo rescue of the tested
   crosses, as evidenced by embryos at this stage exhibiting high
   germination rates, 37.3\% for S x P and 51.3\% for R x P. Among the
   eight tested media, MT medium supplemented with 0.5 mg l(-1) GA(3) was
   the best one for Satsuma mandarin, and MT plus 1.0 mg l(-1) GA(3) for
   Red tangerine. A total of 85 plants were obtained from S x P, and 340
   from R x P. Out of them, 44 progenies from S x P and 111 from R x P were
   sufficiently confirmed to be hybrids by morphological characterization

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1142-1151}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. Trophic relationships are often depicted as networks, in which
   species are connected by links representing predatory interactions.
   Network analyses have also been applied to non-trophic species
   interactions, such as pollination and seed dispersal mutualisms, to
   summarize community-level patterns in mutually beneficial interactions.
   However, the processes responsible for common network properties such as
   degree distributions (the number of interactions maintained by each
   species in the network) and nestedness (the tendency for specialists to
   interact with perfect subsets of the species interacting with
   generalists) are poorly understood.
   2. I evaluated the network properties of a novel type of species
   interaction, commensal interactions between epiphytes and their host
   trees. I quantified the occurrence of 19 vascular epiphyte species on
   seven host tree species in a metacommunity of epiphytes in New Zealand.
   I then developed null models to test whether observed network properties
   result from the frequency of species interactions, which is a commonly
   cited but rarely tested explanation for degree distributions and
   nestedness.
   3. Results showed that degree distributions of both epiphyte and host
   tree species were consistent with a null model that randomly populated
   hosts with epiphytes. Several null models that test for nestedness by
   randomly linking pairs of interacting species showed significantly
   higher nestedness in the real community. In fact, the observed level of
   nestedness was among the highest yet recorded for any type of ecological
   interaction. A second null model that randomized species interactions
   according to their overall frequencies of occurrence in the community
   confirmed support for nestedness.
   4. Results indicate that the degree distributions were consistent with
   randomized expectations; the number of interactions maintained by both
   epiphyte and host tree species appears to be determined by their
   frequency of occurrence in the community. However, interaction
   frequencies could be ruled-out as an explanation for nestedness. Nested
   epiphyte-host interactions may instead result from a predictable
   sequence of epiphyte succession, wherein earlier colonists ameliorate
   environmental conditions within host trees for later recruiting species.}},

Abstract = {{Early development and growth of fruit in the domesticated tomato Solanum
   lycopersicum cultivar Money Maker and two of its wild relatives, S.
   peruvianum LA0385 and S. habrochaites LA1777, were studied. Although
   small differences exist, the processes involved and the sequence of
   events in fruit development are similar in all three species. The growth
   of developing fruits is exponential and the relative growth rate
   accelerates from 5 days after pollination (DAP 5) to DAP 8, followed by
   a decline during further development. Growth is positively correlated to
   the standard ``Brix plus starch'' in the period DAP 8-DAP 20.
   Carbohydrate composition and levels of sugars and organic acids differ
   in fruits of the wild accessions compared to domesticated tomato. The
   wild accessions accumulate sucrose instead of glucose and fructose, and
   ripe fruits contain higher levels of malate and citrate. The enzymes
   responsible for the accumulation of glucose and fructose in domesticated
   tomatoes are soluble invertase and sucrose synthase. The regulation of
   initial carbohydrate metabolism in the domesticated tomato differs from
   that in the wild species, as could be concluded from measuring
   activities of enzymes involved in primary carbohydrate metabolism.
   Furthermore, changes in the activity of several enzymes, e.g., cell wall
   invertase, soluble invertase, fructokinase and phosphoglucomutase, could
   be attributed to changes in gene expression level. For other enzymes,
   additional control mechanisms play a role in the developing tomato
   fruits. Localization by in-situ activity staining of enzymes showed
   comparable results for fruits of domesticated tomato and the wild
   accessions. However, in the pericarp of S. peruvianum, less activity
   staining of phosphogluco-isomerase, phosphoglucomutase and
   UDP-glucosepyrophosphorylase was observed.}},

   clementina and C. sinensis, and 2-3 days for C. unshiu. Pollen tube
   development did not appear to be a limiting factor, whereas C.
   clementina and C. sinensis stigmatic receptivity closely fit the
   effective pollination period and thus appeared to be the main factor
   determining seed set in these two species. In C. unshiu, shorter ovule
   longevity appeared to be the factor determining seed set.
   We conclude that Citrus flower receptivity is genotype-dependent either
   on ovule longevity, as in C. unshiu, or stigmatic receptivity, as in C.
   clementina and C. sinensis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Population genetic effects of urban habitat fragmentation in the
   perennial herb Viola pubescens (Violaceae) using ISSR markers}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Fragmentation of natural habitats can negatively
   impact plant populations by leading to reduced genetic variation and
   increased genetic distance as populations become geographically and
   genetically isolated from one another. To test whether such detrimental
   effects occur within an urban landscape, the genetic structure of six
   populations of the perennial herb Viola pubescens was characterized in
   the metropolitan area of Greater Cincinnati in southwestern Ohio, USA.
   Methods Using three inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, 51 loci
   amplified across all urban populations. For reference, four previously
   examined agricultural populations in central/northern Ohio and a
   geographically distant population in Michigan were also included in the
   analysis.
   Key Results Urban populations retained high levels of genetic variation
   (percentage of polymorphic loci, PP 80.7 \%) with similar genetic
   distances among populations and an absence of unique alleles. Geographic
   and genetic distances were correlated with one another, and all
   populations grouped according to region. Individuals from urban
   populations clustered together and away from individuals from
   agricultural populations and from the Michigan population in a principle
   coordinates analysis. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance
   (AMOVA) revealed that most of the genetic variability was partitioned
   within populations (69.1 \%) and among groups (22.2 \%) of southwestern
   Ohio, central/northern Ohio and Michigan groups. Mean F-st was 0.308,
   indicating substantial population differentiation.
   Conclusions It is concluded that urban fragmentation does not appear to
   impede gene flow in V. pubescens in southwestern Ohio. These results are
   consistent with life history traits of this species and the possibility
   of high insect abundance in urban habitats due to diverse floral
   resources and nesting sites. Combined with the cleistogamous breeding
   system of this species, pollinator availability in the urban matrix may
   buffer populations against detrimental effects of habitat fragmentation,
   at least in larger forest fragments. Consequently, it may be
   inappropriate to generalize about genetic effects of fragmentation
   across landscapes or even across plant species with different
   pollination systems.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of ecosystem services depends on both social and
   ecological features. Here we focus on management, its ecological
   consequences, and social drivers. Our approach combined (1) quantitative
   surveys of local species diversity and abundance of three functional
   groups of ecosystem service providers (pollinators, seed dispersers, and
   insectivores) with (2) qualitative studies of local management practices
   connected to these services and their underlying social mechanisms,
   i.e., institutions, local ecological knowledge, and a sense of place. It
   focused on the ecology of three types of green areas (allotment gardens,
   cemeteries, and city parks) in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. These are
   superficially similar but differ considerably in their management.
   Effects of the different practices could be seen in the three functional
   groups, primarily as a higher abundance of pollinators in the informally
   managed allotment gardens and as differences in the composition of seed
   dispersers and insectivores. Thus, informal management, which is
   normally disregarded by planning authorities, is important for ecosystem
   services in the urban landscape. Furthermore, we suggest that informal
   management has an important secondary function: It may be crucial during
   periods of instability and change as it is argued to promote qualities
   with potential for adaptation. Allotment gardeners seem to be the most
   motivated managers, something that is reflected in their deeper
   knowledge and can be explained by a sense of place and management
   institutions. We propose that co-management would be one possible way to
   infuse the same positive qualities into all management and that improved
   information exchange between managers would be one further step toward
   ecologically functional urban landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{A suspected global decline in pollinators has heightened interest in
   their ecological significance. In a worst-case scenario, the decline of
   generalist pollinators is predicted to trigger cascades of linked
   declines among the multiple specialist plant species to which they are
   linked, but this has not been documented. I Studied a portion of a
   pollination web involving a generalist pollinator, the oil-collecting
   bee Rediviva peringueyi, and a community of oil-secreting plants. Across
   27 established conservation areas located in the Cape Floral Region, I
   found substantial variation in the bees' occurrence in relation to soil
   type and the successional stage of the vegetation. Anthropogenic
   declines were detectable against this background of naturally occurring
   variation: R. peringueyi was absent from small conservation areas (<385
   ha) in an urban matrix. In the absence of the bee, seed set failed in
   six specialist plant species that are pollinated only by R. peringueyi
   but remained high in a pollination generalist, which had replacement
   pollinators. The findings are consistent with theoretical predictions of
   the importance of generalist pollinators in maintaining the structure of
   pollination webs.}},

Abstract = {{Sucrose phosphate synthase {[}SPS (EC 2.4.1.14)] is thought to play a
   critical role in sucrose accumulation in muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.)
   fruit. A full-length cDNA clone encoding sucrose phosphate synthase was

   reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The clone, designated
   CmSPS1, contains 3377 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 3162
   nucleotides. The deduced 1054 amino acids sequence showed high
   identities with other plant sucrose phosphate synthases. Northern blot
   analysis indicated that CmSPS1 was expressed in leaves, stems, and
   mature fruit, but was not detected in roots or flowers. Moreover, the
   mRNA accumulation of CmSPS1 started at 25 days after pollination (DAP)
   and reached highest level in mature fruit. Interestingly, both sucrose
   content and SPS activity increased dramatically between 20 and 30 DAP
   during fruit development, suggesting that sucrose accumulation may be

Abstract = {{The number of airborne pollen produced from plants is visible as a haze
   mixed with urban air pollution in an urban area when atmospheric
   conditions are proper for pollination of pollen from April to May in
   Korea. The big loading of airborne pollen can cause further visibility
   degradation in an urban area. In order to investigate physico-chemical
   characteristics of visibility impairment by airborne pollen, chemical
   aerosol measurements, optical aerosol monitoring, and scenic monitoring
   were performed during the intensive monitoring period from April 19 to
   May 2, 2005 in the urban area of Seoul, Korea. The particles collected
   on filters were examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM)
   interfaced with an energy dispersive X-ray analysis to characterize
   size, elemental composition, and count of airborne pollen. During the
   airborne pollen period, the daily averaged number concentrations of
   airborne pollen; P-PM2.5 and P-PM10 were calculated to be 8.4 +/- 6.9
   and 113.7 +/- 91.1 m(-3), respectively. The daily averaged light
   extinction coefficicnt (b(cxt)), light scattering coefficient for open
   path (b(scat)), light scattering coefficient for dry particle in the
   fine regime (b(scat,fine)), and light absorption coefficient in the fine
   regime (b(abs,fine)) were measured to be 459 +/- 267, 357 +/- 214, 263
   +/- 165, and 44 +/- 30 Mm(-1) respectively. And mass concentration of
   PM2.5 and PM10 were measured to be 46.5 +/- 29.1 and 97.0 +/- 41.7 mu g
   m(-3). The average light absorption coefficicnt by airborne pollen was
   estimated to be about 30 Mm(-1) and the average light scattering

Abstract = {{The spread of alien plant species is a critical ecological event
   worldwide, but the forces that control this spread are not well
   documented. Alien plant species are well known to disrupt ecological
   services of native ecosystems, change the composition of native
   habitats, and often lead to the extirpation of native flora and fauna.
   Here, we report on life history patterns of plant species with rapidly
   spreading and declining ranges in North America's major urban region. We
   tested for differences in life history traits between the 466 native and
   alien woody flora of the New York metropolitan area. We also examined
   the relationship between life history traits and change in distribution
   in the New York metropolitan area between 1900 and 2000. Native and
   alien species of the New York metropolitan area differ with respect to
   pollination vector and breeding system. However, pollination vector and
   breeding system are not associated with success, defined here as
   increasing range spread in the urban environment; instead, fruit type
   (dispersal), life form and origin are important determinants of success.
   Alien species that are deciduous trees, shrubs or vines with fleshy
   fruit are the most successful in increasing their distribution in this
   urban landscape. Newly introduced species with these characteristics are
   expected to have a better chance at establishing in similar urban
   landscapes and should be targets for intensive management. The ability
   to predict which alien species will become invasive is also a valuable
   tool for the prevention of invasions by newly introduced plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Remnant plants in urban fringes and native plants in gardens have the
   potential to contribute to the conservation of threatened plants by
   increasing genetic diversity, effective size of populations, and levels
   of genetic connectedness. But they also pose a threat through the
   disruption of locally adapted gene pools. At Hyams Beach, New South
   Wales, Australia, four bushland stands of the rare shrub, Grevillea
   macleayana McGillivray, surround an urban area containing remnant and
   cultivated specimens of this species. Numbers of inflorescences per
   plant, fruits per plant, and visits by pollinators were similar for
   plants in urban gardens and bushland. Urban plants represented a
   substantial but complex genetic resource, displaying more genetic
   diversity than bushland plants judged by H-c, numbers of alleles per
   locus, and number of private alleles. Of 27 private alleles in urban
   plants, 17 occurred in a set of 19 exotic plant. Excluding the exotic
   plants, all five stands displayed a moderate differentiation (F-ST =
   0.14 +/- 0.02), although the urban remnants clustered with two of the
   bushland stands. These patterns may be explained by high levels of
   selfing and inbreeding in this species and by long-distance dispersal
   (several seeds in the urban stand were fathered by plants in other
   stands). Genetic leakage (gene flow) from exotic plants to 321 seeds on
   surrounding remnant or bushland plants has not occurred. Our results
   demonstrate the conservation value of this group of urban plants, which
   are viable, productive, genetically diverse, and interconnected with
   bushland plants. Gene flow has apparently not yet led to genetic
   contamination of bushland populations, but high levels of inbreeding
   would make this a rare event and difficult to detect. Remnant plants in
   urban gardens could successfully contribute to recovery plans for
   endangered and vulnerable species.}},

Journal = {{HORTSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{42}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Pollination is one problem with intensive seedless watermelon (Citrullus
   lanatus Thunb.) production under unfavorable environmental conditions
   (low solar radiation and temperature) due to the lowered activity of
   pollinating insects, such as the bee (Apis mellifera L.). An alternative
   to overcome these problems is the use of plant growth regulators. For
   this reason, experiments were conducted for 2 years in plastic
   greenhouses in the fields of Almeria, southwestern Spain, to evaluate
   the production and quality of `Reina de corazones' triploid watermelon
   grafted onto RS841 rootstock (Cueurbita maxima x Cucurbita moschata).
   Two phytoregulators were used for the development of the ovary:
   1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3-phenylurea (CPPU) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
   acid (2,4-D). Concentrations of CPPU evaluated were 50, 100, 150, and
   200 mg(.)L(-1). An application of 0.6 mL was applied to each ovary in
   addition to 4, 6, 8, or 12 mg(.)L(-1) of 2,4-D to the foliar mass at a
   proportion of 1000 L(.)ha(-1). Results showed that the production and
   number of fruit obtained with CPPU treatments were similar to what is
   obtained by using bees for fruit pollination. Maximum production was
   reached at concentrations of 100-200 mg(.)L(-1). Average production was
   32\% to 83\% higher than results from 2,4-D at 8 mg(.)L(-1). The number
   of fruit per plant was 33\% to 35\% higher as well. In the first assay,
   a positive correlation was also observed between production and CPPU
   concentration. CPPU treatments had a lower accumulation of sugars than
   those with 2,4-D; nevertheless, both treatments showed values of
   commercially acceptable soluble solids.}},

Abstract = {{The consequence of a proposed pollinator decline for agriculture is a
   subject of much ongoing debate. However pollination requirements of many
   cultivated plants remain unknown. Citrus is complex in terms of
   pollination needs because of great variation in breeding systems among
   and within species, and even among and within cultivars. The objective
   of this study was to evaluate pollinator dependence of three cultivers
   of grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.) planted in northwestern Argentina.
   Bagged flowering branches were assigned to different pollination
   treatments: emasculation, spontaneous self-pollination, hand
   self-pollination, and hand cross-pollination, and the results compared
   with those from open-pollinated flowers. We counted the number of pollen
   grains and pollen tubes in the style, fruit set, and seed pro- duction.
   We also assessed differences in germi- nation rates of self- vs.
   cross-pollen grains. We found that hand and open-pollinated flowers set
   about six times more fruit than emasculated and bagged (insect excluded)
   flowers. In addition, cross-pollen performed better in terms of grain
   germination and tube growth than selfpollen. Although being fully
   self-compatible, apomixis and wind pollination are not important factors
   for grapefruit reproductive success. Thus, insect pollinators represent
   a critical and potential limiting resource for seedless grapefruits from
   northwestern Argentina.}},

Abstract = {{Tecoma stans (L.) Kunth is an exotic plant in Brazil, commonly
   distributed in urban areas, which is considered an invasive species in
   crop and pasture areas. In this study, the floral biology and the
   behavior of bees in flowers of T stans from three urban areas in
   southeastern Brazil were investigated. In all study sites, T stans was
   an important food resource to the Apoidea to 48 species of bees. Centris
   tarsata Smith and Exomalopsis fulvofasciata Smith (Hymenoptera: Apidae)
   were the effective pollinators more abundant, while Scaptotrigona
   depilis Moure (Hymenoptera: Apidae) was the more frequent robber
   species. The most part of T stans visitors (87.5\%) exploited
   exclusively nectar, which varied in sugar concentration depending on the
   day period and flower phase. In all flower stages, higher averages of
   nectar concentration (26.4\% to 32.7\%) occurred from 10 am to 2 pm. The
   presence of osmophore in the petals and protandry were detected. In two
   urban areas the number of visitors varied significantly during the day.
   The greatest abundance of pollinators occurred when pollen availability
   was higher and flowers showed receptive stigma, which could be
   contributing to the reproductive success of T stans. The results
   indicate that the production of fruits increased in plants that received
   a higher number of effective pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{The use of nectar feeders has grown a lot as a result of people wanting

   one case (Salvia fulgens) produced fewer seeds than the controls. Salvia
   mexicana was not only visited by hummingbirds but it was also by bees
   that were not attracted to the feeders, probably resulting in the lack

Abstract = {{Lebanon's native flora is threatened by loss of natural habitat to rural
   and urban development and the increased demand of plant materials for
   landscaping. Despite Lebanon's floristic richness, most taxa used for
   landscaping are non-native. This study was done to determine if Cercis
   siliquastrunt (L.) is amenable to container production. Therefore, six
   open pollinated seeds sources native to Lebanon were grown under two
   fertilizer rates to study growth, N, P, K uptake efficiency, and
   partitioning. Two-year-old seedlings were planted in 11 L containers in
   a 3:1 pine bark:compost substrate. Seedlings within each seed source or
   mother tree were grown at either 25 or 100 mg N L-1 from 21N-3.1P-5.9K
   water-soluble fertilizer. Seedlings of all sources grown under 25 mg N
   L-1 had greater dry weight than those grown at 100 mg. Nutrient loading
   occurred in plants under the high fertilizer rate, although total plant
   N, P, and K content were not affected by fertilizer rate. There were
   significant differences in mineral nutrient uptake and nutrient use
   efficiencies among the seed sources. The results show that C.
   siliquastrum is amenable to container production. The great variation in
   growth rate and nutrient use efficiency among the limited number of seed
   sources studied suggest that significant improvement can be made through
   mother tree selection and/or clonal propagation of superior individual
   plants within a source. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The obligate interaction between figs and their pollinating wasps is
   often cited as an extraordinary example of reciprocal species
   specificity and evolutionary cospeciation. However, recent studies have
   shown that breakdowns in one-to-one specificity are not rare (30-60\% of
   species depending on the locality). Combined with evidence of
   hybridization in some species, this led researchers to propose that a
   better evolutionary model was one of groups of genetically well-defined
   pollinators coevolving with groups of frequently hybridizing figs.
   Nevertheless, these recent studies still indicate that a majority of fig
   species have one or more host-specific pollinator. The extent to which
   specificity barriers in these species are leaky will have important
   consequences for the evolutionary process in Ficus. At Lambir Hills
   N.P., Sarawak, a single individual of Ficus acamptophylla has become
   recently isolated from conspecifics through clearance of its specialized
   habitat, but adjacent forest has a diverse fig flora, including 16
   species with congeneric pollinators. Thus, when this individual flowered
   I was able to investigate the maintenance of its specificity barriers in
   the absence of competition from the normal pollinator. Only 1 percent of
   inflorescences were entered by a single pollinator species, which had
   very low reproductive success, and no viable seeds were produced.
   Nonpollinating wasps also failed to reproduce in any of the
   inflorescences. These results indicate the maintenance of strict
   specificity barriers in this fig individual.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to study the relation between climate change
   and the earliness of Birch pollination, a tree that produces allergenic
   pollen, which is of particular importance in north-western Europe. The
   study allowed us to make projections for the next few years in order to
   evaluate the evolution of Birch pollination starting date according to
   spring temperatures. It has been done in ten European locations, Kevo
   and Turku (Finland), London (United Kingdom), Paris and Lyon (France),
   Brussels (Belgium), Zurich (Switzerland), Vienna (Austria), Poznan and
   Cracow (Poland). The study period ranged from six to twenty-eight years
   depending on the city. Pollens were recorded daily thanks to volumetric
   Hirst traps, and the data were compared to monthly temperatures from
   January to May using correlations and multiple regressions. Except in
   Kevo where the trend is towards colder springs and a later pollination,
   in the other cities the results showed a spring warming associated with
   an earlier starting date of pollination: this trend is very well marked
   in Turku, Zurich, London, Vienna and Brussels, less evident in France
   while there is no trend in Poland. The results of this work should lead
   to an updating of the pollen calendars and the pollen forecast models,
   in the cities where there is a pronounced trend. (C) 2006 Elsevier

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{It is important for conservation biologists to understand how well
   species persist in human-dominated ecosystems because protected areas
   constitute a small fraction of the Earth's surface and because
   anthropogenic habitats may offer more opportunities for conservation
   than has been previously thought We investigated how an important
   functional group, pollinators (bees; Hymenoptera: Apiformes), are
   affected by human land use at the landscape and local scales in southern
   New Jersey (USA.). We established 40 sites that differed in surrounding
   landscape cover or local habitat type and collected 2551 bees of 130
   species. The natural habitat in this ecosystem is a forested, ericaceous
   heath. Bee abundance and species richness within forest habitat
   decreased, not increased, with increasing forest cover in the
   surrounding landscape. Similarly, bee abundance was greater in
   agricultural fields and suburban and urban developments than in
   extensive forests, and the same trend was found for species richness.
   Particular species groups that might be expected to show greater
   sensitivity to habitat loss, such as floral specialists and bees of
   small or large body size, did not show strong positive associations with
   forest habitat Nevertheless, 18 of the 130 bee species studied were
   positively associated with extensive forest, One of these species is a
   narrow endemic that was last seen in 1939. Our results suggest that at
   least in this system, moderate anthropogenic land use may be compatible
   with the conservation of many but not all, bee species.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to investigate the ability of Acidovorax avenae
   ssp. citrulli, the causal agent of bacterial fruit blotch of cucurbits
   (BFB), to colonize female watermelon blossoms, and to explore the
   relationship between blossom inoculum dosage and seed infestation. Under
   greenhouse conditions A. avenae ssp. citrulli colonized stigmas and
   styles of female watermelon blossoms reaching populations of approximate
   to 10(7) to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU) per blossom for 96 h after
   inoculation. Acidovorax avenae ssp. citrulli growth on stigmas was
   slower than that of Pseudomonas syringae Cit7, a non-pathogenic, foliar
   epiphyte of tomato. While pollination reduced growth of A. avenae ssp.
   citrulli, but P. syringae Cit7 was unaffected. Both bacteria colonized
   style tissues but bacterial growth in the style was significantly less
   than the stigma. Blossom inoculation with approximate to 1 x 10(3)A.
   avenae ssp. citrulli CFU/blossom led to 36-55\% infested seedlots within
   symptomless fruits. On average 14\% of the seedlings produced from these
   seedlots displayed BFB symptoms. There was a strong positive correlation
   between A. avenae ssp. citrulli inoculum concentration applied to
   blossoms and the percentage of infested seedlots, as determined by the
   seedling grow-out assay (R-2 = 0.94). However, this relationship was
   weaker when seedlot infestation was determined by a polymerase chain
   reaction-based assay (R-2 = 0.34). There was also a strong positive
   linear relationship between A. avenae ssp. citrulli blossom inoculum
   dose and the mean percentage of BFB-infected seedlings (R-2 = 0.99)
   produced in seedling grow-out assays. These data support the hypothesis
   that blossom colonization might be involved in seed infestation under
   field conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Year-round flowering is widely reported in fig trees and is necessary
   for the survival of their short-living, specialized Agaonid pollinators.
   However, seasonality in both fig and leaf production has been noted in
   almost all published phenological studies. We have addressed the
   following questions in the present study: (1) Are reproductive and
   vegetative phenologies seasonal and, consequently, related to climate?
   (2) Does Ficus citrifolia produce ripe figs year round? (3) Is the fig
   development related to climate? And, (4) Are reproductive and vegetative
   phenologies independent? By investigating these questions with a F.
   citrifolia population over a two-year period, at the southern edge of
   the tropical region in Brazil, we detected phenological seasonality that
   was significantly correlated with climate. Our findings can be
   summarized as follows: (1) Trees became deciduous during the cold and
   dry months; (2) The flowering onset was asynchronous among individuals,
   but with moderate concentration during the hot and rainy months; (3)
   There was a correlation between the onset of flowering and vegetative
   phenology, with significantly higher crop initiations in individuals
   with full-leaf canopy; (4) Fig developmental time was longer in cold
   months; and (5) Ripe fig production occurred year-round and was not
   correlated with climate. Our results suggest that there are strong
   selection pressures that maintain the year-round flowering phenology in
   figs, for we have observed little seasonality in the phenology of such
   species despite the strong seasonality in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Coincya monensis is represented in the British flora by two,
   cytologically distinct subspecies. Coincya monensis ssp monensis is an
   endemic diploid with a coastal sand dune distribution that includes a
   number of isolated populations. Coincya monensis ssp cheiranthos is a
   tetraploid alien, well established in South Wales in early successional
   habitats. Both subspecies share similar life form traits, flowering
   times and pollinators. Cluster analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction
   based on sequences of the mitochondrial nad4 gene confirmed the
   distinction between alien and endemic taxa. Tetraploid populations carry
   more polymorphic RAPIDS loci and their genetic diversity is partitioned
   more within than among populations. In contrast, C. monensis ssp
   monensis has a distinct population genetic structure. Analysis of the
   multilocus genetic data confirmed a structure of genetically isolated,
   endemic population clusters in Scotland, Arran, the Isle of Man and
   South Wales. Experimental hybridisation showed the two subspecies are
   interfertile. Multivariate analysis of RAPDs data resolved hybrids
   between alien and endemic clusters and hybrids contained a proportion of
   alien-specific polymorphic loci. Hybrids of alien maternal parentage
   contained the mitochondrial nad4 sequence characteristic of the alien
   subspecies. Since the alien subspecies can invade mobile sand dune
   communities from urban sites and compete for pollinators, there is a
   risk that alien and endemic populations will mix and introgress.
   Conservation of endemic genetic diversity in Britain will require
   protection for all C. monensis ssp monensis populations. Currently, the
   most disjunct endemic population in South Wales is most at risk from
   introgression.}},

Title = {{Foraging patterns of the southeastern blueberry bee Habropoda laboriosa
   (Apidae, Hymenoptera): Implications for understanding oligolecty}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Previous observations have suggested that the blueberry bee (Habropoda
   laboriosa,Apidae) is oligolectic on blueberries (Vaccinium sp.) but
   visits a number of secondary plant species for nectar. To examine how
   oligolecty persists in human modified habitats: (1) observations were
   made of plants it visited in both urban and rural habitats, (2) the type
   of pollen on its body was measured when foraging on either Vaccinium or
   Gelsernium, and (3) foraging behavior on Vaccinium, Gelsemium, and
   Azalea was studied across an rural/suburban/urban land use gradient in a
   foraging preference experiment.
   Male and female blueberry bees were recorded foraging on a wide range of
   plants in urban, suburban, and rural areas for both pollen and nectar.
   Female bees collected pollen from five genera in four families. Pollen
   on male and female bees collected on either Vaccinium or Gelsemium was
   predominantly from the species from which it was collected, but many
   specimens had both pollen types present. There were significant
   differences in foraging preferences among the three plant species and
   between gender. Overall, females preferred Gelsemium to Vaccinium, but
   males showed the opposite pattern. For both females and males, Azalea
   was the least preferred. Variation in the local abundance of flowers
   among the sites was not related to foraging preference. The foraging
   patterns of H. laboriosa in the landscape of human modified ecosystems
   suggests that H. laboriosa may be a mesolectic bee, using pollen from a
   few unrelated species, as opposed to a narrow oligolege (using pollen
   from only a few related species of Vaccinium). The preference for
   Gelsemium among female bees suggests that plantings of Gelsemium might
   be useful in enhancing populations of H. laboriosa in blueberry
   cultivation.}},

Abstract = {{The progeny of 87 BC1 hybrids of `Murcott' tangor and Wra' sweet orange,
   genotyped with fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism
   (fAFLP) markers, was used for the construction of genetic maps for both

   2.0 (LOD score >= 3.0 and <= 0.40) and JoinMap 3.0 software (LOD score !
   3.0 and 0: 0.25), respectively. Genetic map distances (in cM) between
   the linked fAFLPs were estimated, in both packages, by the Kosambi's
   function. Maps of both parents were constructed in Mapmaker with 121 of
   the 202 fAFLP markers showing 1: 1 Mendelian segregation rates
   ('Murcott' map: 65 fAFLPs, average distance between them 29.5 cM,

   analysis of 347 fAFLP markers with 3:1 or 1: 1 segregation rates by
   using JoinMap, resulted in the linkage of 227 markers with an average
   distance of 4.25 cM among them, divided into 9 LGs of 845 cM. fAFLP loci
   showing distorted segregation and/or clustered were observed in
   different LGs of the maps generated by all the software. The use of

Title = {{Behavior of Platanus hispanica pollen, an important spring aeroallergen
   in northwestern Spain}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIONAL ALLERGOLOGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{145-156}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objective: Platanus hispanica trees are considered an
   important source of airborne pollen allergens in many cities of Western
   Europe. As the prevalence of sensitization to this species is 8\% to 9\%
   in northwestern Spain, our objective was to propose models predicting
   both the onset of the pollen season and the mean daily pollen
   concentrations.
   Methods: Airborne Phispanica, pollen was monitored from 1993 through
   2002 with 2 Hirst volumetric spore traps in Ourense and Santiago de
   Compostela in northwestern Spain. The pollination start dates were
   determined and the data were fitted to predictive regression models,
   which were tested for the year 2002.
   Results: P hispanica pollen is present in the atmosphere from March to
   April. The main pollination period is short with a mean duration of
   around 40 days. The mean maximum daily concentrations exceeded 100
   pollen grains/ml. As temperature is the parameter that most influences
   atmospheric pollen levels, this variable was chosen as the basis for
   models predicting both the onset of the pollen season and daily pollen
   concentrations. The predicted onset date was a few days later than the
   real start date in 2002. However, the model gave an accurate prediction
   of the mean daily pollen concentration.
   Conclusions: The mean daily concentrations of P hispanica pollen are
   high, and given the allergenic potential of this species, it should be
   taken into account as one of the most important local spring allergens.
   The weather-related models proposed help us to predict P hispanica
   pollen concentrations in the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{The commercial date industry in the United States is located primarily
   in the Sonoran Desert of southeast California and southwest Arizona. The
   industry comprises about 3800 hectares, of which 78\% is found in
   California and the rest in Arizona. While date palms were introduced to
   the United States by the Spaniards, small quantities were imported for
   experimental purposes beginning in the late 1800's, and commercial
   quantities were imported in the early 1900's. During this period, most
   imported offshoots originated from Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia and Iraq.
   Important varieties that were imported include `Deglet Noor',
   `Khadrawi', `Zahidi', `Hayany' and `Halawy'. More recently, the
   `Medjool' from Morocco was introduced. This variety is becoming
   increasingly popular because of its large size and high sugar content.
   Date palm operations are moving from areas that are under pressure from
   urbanization to more remote locales. Low volume drip and microjet
   irrigation is beginning to replace the tradition flood and basin
   irrigation methods. Some dates are produced using organic methods
   because of consumer demand. Farm operations begin in January when the
   trees are dethorned. Operations that occur later in the year include
   pollination, training the fruit arms, strand thinning, fruit thinning,
   supporting the arms, spreading the strands, bagging the developing fruit
   and harvest. Individual growers are increasingly forming cooperatives to
   pack the fruit at a centrally located packinghouse. At the house, fruit
   are graded, then packed, and placed in storage until shipment. Dates
   from the region are marketed by individual growers, and by the grower
   cooperatives, and sold to customers around the world. Palm trees are
   also sold for landscape purposes to customers across the United States.}},

Abstract = {{Paphippedilum, commonly known as the ``lady's slipper orchid{''} is a
   fascinating genus of orchids. The wild populations are under the threat
   of extinction as a result of over-collection and habitat destruction,
   and species are listed in the Convention on International Trade in
   Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The improvement of
   germination percentage could provide a practical way to re-establish
   plants in the wild and for commercial propagation. In this report, we
   study the effects of seed maturity and seed pretreatments on the
   asymbiotic germination of six Paphippedilum species (P. bellatulum, P.
   godefroyae, P. niveum, P. helenae, P. henryanum, and P. spicerianum).
   The timing of seed collection is critical in maximizing germination
   percentage in these six species. In P. bellatulum and P. niveum, the
   seeds collected from 120 to 150 days after pollination (DAP) were the
   optimum for culture in vitro. In P. godefroyae, the optimum time was
   found from 90 to 120 DAP. In P. niveum, the optimum time was found from
   120 to 150 DAP. In P. henryanum and P. spicerianum, the optimum time was
   found from 120 to 180 DAP. Pretreatment of the mature seeds of six
   species with 1\% NaOCI for 60 to 75 min improved the germination
   percentage. The pretreatment may scarify the seed coat and increase the
   permeability of seed, which improves germination of mature seeds.}},

Abstract = {{The Podostemaceae are a large family (48 genera and 270 species) of
   aquatic flowering plants that grow attached to rocks and boulders
   exclusively in running water or under cataracts in the tropical and
   subtropical regions of the Old World and the New World. The family is
   divided into two subfamilies-the Tristichoideae and the Podostemoideae.
   The plants of this family are characterized by a set of unusual
   morphological, anatomical, embryological, developmental and evolutionary
   features not found in such a combination in any other group of
   angiosperms.
   The podostemad plant body is thalloid and lacks air spaces
   characteristic of aquatic macrophytes. It deviates markedly from the
   classical root shoot (CRS) model of typical angiosperms. Evolutionary
   forces seem to have modified these plants to such an extent that
   morphological entities such as root, stem and leaf cannot be applied
   with 1:1 homology, leading to `fuzzy morphology'. The organ identity of
   the thallus and its components has been a subject of much dispute ever
   since the first podostemad was discovered. The prevalence of high
   plasticity, perplexing polymorphism and marked structural reductionism
   make the taxonomic delimitation a despairing experience. The genus
   Polypleurum has so many forms that each one of them has been given the
   status of a species.
   Podostemaceae have often been cited as an embryological family because
   of absence of antipodal cells, triple fusion, endosperm, and occurrence
   of a 4-nucleate mature embryo sac, single fertilization and a
   pseudo-embryo sac. With increasing interest in the search for lineages
   of the ancient flowering plants, the simple module of the podostemad
   embryo sac with a single fertilization offers an interesting system for
   evolutionary studies. Double fertilization is considered a ubiquitous,
   defining, ancestral feature of angiosperms. Nevertheless, its absence in
   all the podostemads investigated so far suggests either a polyphyletic
   origin of angiosperms or embryological reductionism. The mature
   podostemad embryo is highly simplified as it lacks an identifiable shoot
   apical meristem and a root apical meristem. In the absence of the two
   apical growing points, how, when and from where does a thalloid plant
   body arise has been a subject of our research for many years. As it is
   almost impossible to investigate seed germination in the environment of
   a turbulent river, we conducted studies using an aseptic method with a
   modified nutrient medium. Five members of Podostemoideae studied by us
   show that the radicular pole remains quiescent. A shoot apical meristem
   is initiated at the putative plumular region that eventually
   differentiates a highly reduced, determinate primary axis. The main
   plant body arises as a lateral outgrowth of the shoot apical meristem
   that subsequently ruptures the hypocotyl to emerge and spread
   diageotropically on the substratum. in two species namely- Polypleurum
   stylosum and Indotristicha ramosissima, plants have been grown to
   maturity and induced to flower under experimental stress conditions.
   In nature the podostemads complete their vegetative phase and initiate
   flowering while they are still submerged. Pollination and fruit
   formation generally occur above water. Our research group has studied
   the reproductive biology and traced pollination strategies beginning
   from autogamy under aerial conditions to cleistogamy under submerged
   situation. Contrary to the general condition noticed in aquatic
   angiosperms,. seed set is very high. Some taxonomic literature points to
   the affinities of the Podostemaceae with Rosaceae, Saxifragaceae,
   Hydrostachyclaceae and Crassulaceae. Interestingly, the recent
   phylogenetic studies using rbcL data suggest a possible sister group
   relationship of Podostemaceae (within Malphigiales clade) to
   Crassulaceae (Saxifragales).}},

Abstract = {{Golf courses and estates are one form of development threatening coastal
   vegetation in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. They occupy
   substantial tracts of land, fragmenting indigenous vegetation. This
   study investigates the effects on bird community structure and function
   of replacing natural Strandveld vegetation with a 170-ha golf estate in
   which 46 ha of Strandveld vegetation was retained in conditions ranging
   from pristine to moderately degraded. Bird assemblages of the remaining
   Strandveld patches in the golf estate were compared with those of an
   adjacent Strandveld conservation area. Field work was conducted during
   the birds' breeding season, in October and November 2005. The golf
   estate was more species rich overall, but many species were uncommon,
   several were present only as a consequence of the creation of new
   habitats, and species were not evenly distributed across the remaining
   Strandveld fragments. Bird diversity and abundance were significantly
   higher in the adjacent conservation area. It is estimated that more than
   8500 individual birds were displaced by construction of the golf estate
   and four Strandveld species were not represented at all within the
   estate. Within the estate, species richness rose with increasing
   Strandveld patch size and the minimum area of continuous pristine
   vegetation required to maintain the natural species assemblage was
   estimated at 51 ha. The golf estate was characterized by a high
   proportion of generalist and granivorous species, but at the cost of
   reduced numbers of frugivores and nectarivores. Energy flow through the
   bird communities in the two areas was thus markedly different, and
   pollination and fruit dispersal potential within the golf estate were
   reduced substantially. Golf courses and golf estates inevitably will not
   substitute for the natural habitats they have replaced, but careful
   design with input from ecological theory can reduce the adverse effects
   of fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{With the introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops, predictive
   tools modelling wind velocity and pollen concentration fields as well as
   pollen deposition rate over heterogeneous canopies are required to
   assess the cross-pollination rates between GM and conventional crops.
   Over the last decade several numerical flow models have been developed
   to simulate dynamic mean and turbulent fields within and above the
   vegetation layer. In this paper, an Eulerian advection-diffusion
   conservation equation for pollen particles has been incorporated into
   one of these flow models, Aquilon. The relative velocity between air
   parcels and particles is simply represented through the addition of a
   particle settling velocity, i.e. the particle fall velocity in still
   fluid. The dynamic part of this model has been previously validated in
   two-dimensional heterogeneous cases (roughness change, forest edge flow)
   and tested in a more complex three-dimensional heterogeneous case (urban
   forested park). In order to test the ability of this Eulerian approach
   to simulate accurately airborne pollen concentration and pollen
   deposition rate within and above heterogeneous vegetation canopies, the
   model is validated against two field experiments where the airborne
   concentration and the deposition rate of maize pollen (Zea mays) were
   measured downwind from source plots. We also compare the outputs of
   Aquilon with those of a Lagrangian model previously tested against the
   same dataset. Generally speaking the model performs well, with a similar
   accuracy to the Lagrangian model. However, both models underestimate the
   measured maximum in ground pollen deposition just downwind from the
   maize plot. It is shown that this discrepancy may be due to an
   underestimation of the pollen settling velocity in this region. As the
   Stokes number, defined as the ratio between the maize pollen response
   time and the characteristic time of the turbulent structures at
   dissipation-range scale, is about 1 in the wake region behind the source
   plot, it is likely that turbulence leads to an increase in the apparent
   settling velocity there. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination provided by bees enhances the production of many crops.
   However, the contribution of wild bees remains unmeasured for many
   crops, and the effects of anthropogenic change on many bee species are
   unstudied. We experimentally investigated how pollination by wild bees
   affects tomato production in northern California. We found that wild
   bees substantially increase the production of field-grown tomato, a crop
   generally considered self-pollinating. Surveys of the bee community on
   14 organic fields that varied in proximity to natural habitat showed
   that the primary bee visitors, Anthophora urbana Cresson and Bombus
   vosnesenskii Radoszkowski, were affected differently by land management
   practices. B. vosnesenskii was found primarily on farms proximate to
   natural habitats, but neither proximity to natural habitat nor tomato
   floral abundance, temperature, or year explained variation in the
   visitation rates of A. urbana. Natural habitat appears to increase B.
   vosnesenskii populations and should be preserved near farms. Additional
   research is needed to determine how to maintain A. urbana.
   Species-specific differences in dependency on natural habitats
   underscore the importance of considering the natural histories of
   individual bee species when projecting population trends of pollinators
   and designing management plans for pollination services. Thus, to
   maintain an entire bee community, multiple approaches, including
   maintaining natural habitat, should be implemented. (c) 2006 Elsevier

   extends from September through May. Anthesis occurs from 5:30 a.m. to
   5:00 p.m. and nectar and pollen are available during all the anthesis.
   Many species of beetles, hemipterans, flies, wasps, bees and butterflies
   visit their flowers, but bees and butterflies are the most frequent
   visitors. The flowers are generally small, gathered in dense showy
   inflorescences. A complex of floral characteristcs, such as violet-blue
   color of flowers, long floral tubes, without scents, nectar not exposed,
   high concentration of sugar in nectar (about 32\%), allowed
   identification of floral syndromes (melittophily and psicophily) and
   function for each visitor. The bees, Bombus morio, B. atratus,
   Trigonopedia ferruginea, Xylocopa brasilianorum and Apis mellifera and
   the butterflies Corticea mendica mendica, Corticea sp., Vehilius
   clavicula, Urbanus simplicius, U. teleus and Heraclides thoas
   brasiliensis, are the most important pollinators.}},

Title = {{Economic valuation of a seed dispersal service in the Stockholm National

Abstract = {{Most economic valuation studies of species derive from stated
   preferences methods. These methods fail to take into account
   biodiversity values that the general public is not (made) informed about
   or has no experience with. Hence, production function (PF) and
   replacement cost (RC) approaches to valuation may be preferable in
   situations where species perform key life support functions in
   ecosystems, such as seed dispersal, pollination, or pest regulation. We
   conduct an RC analysis of the seed dispersal service performed by the
   Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) in the Stockholm National Urban Park,
   Sweden. The park holds one of the largest populations of giant oaks in
   Europe, and the oak (Quercus robur and Quercus petrea) represents a
   keystone species in the hemiboreal forests. The primary objective was to
   estimate the number of seed-dispersed oak trees that resulted from jays
   and to determine the costs of replacing this service though human means.
   Results show that depending upon seeding or planting technique chosen,
   the RC per pair of jays in the park is SEK 35,000 (USD 4900) and SEK
   160,000 (USD 22,500), respectively. Based on the park's aggregated oak
   forest-area, average RC for natural oak forest regeneration by jays is
   SEK 15,000 (USD 2100) to SEK 67,000 (USD 9400) per hectare,
   respectively. These estimates help motivating investments in management
   strategies that secure critical breeding and foraging habitats of jays,
   including coniferous forests and jay movement corridors. The analysis
   also illustrates the need for detailed ecological-economic knowledge in
   a PF or RC analysis. The continuous temporal and spatial oak dispersal
   service provided by jays holds several benefits compared to a man-made
   replacement of this service. PF and RC approaches are particularly
   motivated in cases of known functional ecological relationships, and
   critically important in estimating management measures where mobile link
   organisms and keystone species form key mutual relationships that
   generate high biodiversity benefits. In relation to obtained results, we
   discuss insights for conducting valuation studies on particular species.

Abstract = {{Honey bees are important avocado pollinators. However, due to the low
   attractiveness of flowers, pollination is often inadequate. Previous
   work has revealed that avocado honey is relatively unattractive to honey
   bees when compared with honey from competing flowers. We characterized
   avocado honey and nectar with respect to their odor, color, and
   composition of sugars, phenolic compounds, and minerals. Furthermore, we
   tested how honey bees perceive these parameters, using the proboscis
   extension response bioassay and preference experiments with free-flying
   bees. Naive bees were indifferent to odors of avocado and citrus flowers
   and honey. Experienced bees, which were collected in the field during
   the blooming season, responded preferentially to odor of citrus flowers.
   The unique sugar composition of avocado nectar, which contains almost
   exclusively sucrose and a low concentration of the rare carbohydrate
   perseitol, and the dark brown color of avocado honey, had no negative
   effects on its attractiveness to the bees. Phenolic compounds extracted
   from avocado honey were attractive to bees and adding them to a solution
   of sucrose increased its attractiveness. Compared with citrus nectar and
   nonavocado honey, avocado nectar and honey were rich in a wide range of
   minerals, including potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, sulfur, iron, and
   copper. Potassium and phosphorus, the two major minerals, both had a
   repellent effect on the bees. Possible explanations for the presence of
   repellent components in avocado nectar are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the time-activity budgets of Amazilia amazilia, a
   territorial hummingbird, and its preferences for different flower
   species and perches in the gardens of Lima (Peru) in September 2001. A.
   amazilia spent an important part of its time resting on perches (ca.
   80\%) and only 15.5\% for foraging, devoted essentially to flower
   visitation and only 0.3\% for hunting and drinking water. Territorial
   defence accounted for 2\% of total time, mostly against Coereba
   flaveola, an introduced nectarivorous species that seem to be an
   important competitor of A. amazilia. Flower use is not directly related
   to flower abundance (chi(2)(9) = 1 546, p < 0.0001), with Justicia
   brandegeana and red-flowered Salvia splendens being selected and
   Impatiens balsamina being rejected. The large amount of time spent on
   the perches makes them an important element of the habitat. The perches
   selected are typically on trees, close to the flowers visited, and in a
   low vertical and middle horizontal position, surrounded by low foliage
   density, probably to minimize heat loss.}},

Abstract = {{Plants could potentially compensate for floral herbivory by regrowing
   flowering stalks and by forming additional vegetative stems. Because
   scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis aggregata (Pursh) V. Grant) is described as
   monocarpic, its ability to regrow multiple flowering stalks following
   the removal of its primary inflorescence has been cited as the species'
   primary means of compensating for herbivory. However, ancillary rosette
   formation could also contribute to compensation in subsequent years. To
   determine if herbivory induces ancillary rosette formation and whether
   energy diverted to vegetative regrowth reduces reproductive output, we
   analyzed the response of scarlet gilia to elk herbivory in the Wenatchee
   National Forest of Washington State. Control plants were protected from
   herbivory by wire enclosures; clipped plants were hand-cut to simulate
   herbivory; and grazed plants were left vulnerable to elk herbivory.
   Ninety percent of plants that lost inflorescences regrew multiple
   flowering stalks; these plants produced fewer fruits and seeds than
   protected plants, indicating that scarlet gilia undercompensated for
   herbivory despite greater aboveground biomass. The plants that regrew
   multiple flowering stalks were also more likely to form ancillary
   rosettes, which could increase compensation over multiple seasons.
   Although herbivory reduced initial fecundity, grazing generated
   morphological changes that could enable the plant to achieve a greater
   degree of compensation over time.}},

Abstract = {{Carotene pigments in flowers and fruits are distinct features related to

   biosynthesis pathway in papaya, we took a candidate gene approach to
   clone the lycopene beta-cyclase gene, LCY-B. A papaya LCY-B ortholog,
   cpLCY-B, was successfully identified from both cDNA and bacterial
   artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries and complete genomic sequence was
   obtained from the positive BAC including the promoter region. This
   cpLCY-B shared 80\% amino acid identity with citrus LCY-B. However, full
   genomic sequences from both yellow- and red-fleshed papaya were
   identical. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) revealed similar levels of
   expression at six different maturing stages of fruits for both yellow-
   and red-fleshed genotypes. Further expression analyses of cpLCY-B showed
   that its expression levels were seven- and three-fold higher in leaves

   but was fitted by power-law models, implying a large contribution from
   distant fields to the catches observed. After allowance for this
   `background' by applying Fourier transforms to deconvolve the mixture of
   distant and local sources, the data were best fit by power-laws with
   exponents between 1.5 and 2. We also demonstrate that for a simple model
   of area sources, the median dispersal distance is a function of field
   radius and that measurement from the source edge can be misleading.
   Using an inverse-square dispersal distribution deduced from the
   experimental data and the distribution of rapeseed fields deduced by
   remote sensing, we successfully predict observed rapeseed pollen density
   in the city centres of Derby and Leicester (UK).}},

Abstract = {{Increases in phospholipase D {[}PLD (EC 3.1.4.4)] and lipoxygenase
   {[}LOX (EC 1.13.11.12)] activities are thought to play a critical role
   in senescence of mesocarp tissues in netted and normetted muskmelon
   (Cucumis melo L.) fruits. We have cloned and characterized two
   full-length cDNAs, CmPLD alpha 1 and CmLOX1, encoding PLD alpha and LOX
   proteins in honeydew melon (C. melo Inodorus Group cv. Honey Brew).
   Relative levels of expression of the corresponding genes were determined
   by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in developing and mature fruit mesocarp
   tissues {[}20-60 d after pollination (DAP)], as well as in roots,
   leaves, and stems from 4-week-old and flowers from 6- to 7-week-old
   plants. The coding regions of CITIPLD alpha 1 and CmLOX1 cDNAs are,
   respectively, 2427 and 2634 nucleotides long, encoding proteins 808 and
   877 amino acids in length. CmPLD alpha 1 is very similar to PLD alpha
   genes from castor bean (Ricinis communis L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata
   L.), strawberry (Fragaria xananassa Duch.) and tomato (Lycopersicon
   esculentum Mill.) (77\% nucleotide identity), and is the first PLD gene
   cloned from a cucurbit species. CmLOX1 has 94\% nucleotide identity to a
   cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) LOX gene expressed in roots and 80\%
   identity to cucumber cotyledon lipid body LOX. In general, transcript of
   CmPLD alpha 1 was much more abundant than that of CmLOX1, but relative
   levels of transcript in the various organs and tissues were similar for
   the two genes. Expression was highest in roots, flowers, and fruit
   mesocarp tissues. CmPLD alpha 1 expression in fruit was essentially
   constitutive throughout development, although maximum levels occurred at
   50 and 55 DAP, respectively, in middle and hypodermal mesocarp. CmLOX1
   expression was generally higher in middle than in hypodermal mesocarp
   with maximum transcript levels occurring at 55 and 50 DAP, respectively.
   Overall, the patterns of expression of CmPLD alpha 1 and CmLOX1 are
   consistent with a model in which their encoded enzymes act in tandem to
   promote or accelerate senescence in fruit mesocarp tissues.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine if and how the honeybee reduces
   the blooming period of canola (Brassica napus). Colonies were installed
   in different fields of canola in the Chaudiere-Appalaches (two
   replicates) and Quebec City (one replicate) regions to create a density
   gradient of zero to three colonies per hectare. To calculate the
   blooming period under these conditions, 10 labelled plants were caged in
   the field, out of the reach of pollinators, and 10 others were labelled
   in the field and exposed to foragers. The number of flowers found on
   each plant was recorded daily. This study also aims at demonstrating
   that the canola plant will produce new flowers as long as it does not
   reach its maximum carrying capacity, thereby extending the blooming
   period. To simulate the fall of unfertilized flowers, a predetermined
   number of flowers from 20 randomly selected plants in one of the
   replicates were cut off every day. The plant, when it reaches its
   maximum carrying capacity, stops producing new flowers. With three
   colonies per hectare, the blooming period was reduced by 3.8 days, or 17
   \% compared with in the absence of pollinators. Because of the efficient
   pollen transfer to the stigma, the honeybees do not only cause the
   flower to live for a shorter period of time, but they also bring about a
   decrease in the number of flowers produced by the plant, thereby
   reducing the duration of blooming period.}},

   Curacao from 1993 to 2003}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{In view of their ecological importance and the abundance of threats on a
   developing Caribbean island, we surveyed the bats of Curacao,
   Netherlands Antilles, and examined changes in the populations of seven
   threatened species over a decade, using previously published data as a
   baseline for comparison. The most important caves for bats (in terms of
   species representation and reproduction) were visited yearly, and
   monthly in 2001. Noctilio leporinus still occurs on the island, but does
   not appear to be numerous (six observed in 2003). We captured Myotis
   nesopolus nesopolus, but its roosting sites remain unknown.
   Leptonycteris curasoae curasoae numbers varied greatly, even within a
   year, and it may travel to and from other islands and Venezuela.
   Overall, however, the population of this species on Curacao seems to be
   declining (1000 in 1993 and 625 in 2003); the disappearance of this
   pollinator could have severe consequences for the Curacao ecosystem.
   Mormoops megalophylla intermedia is declining as well; in 2003, we
   counted 403 individuals including 75 pups, from 500 to 600 adults in the
   10 previous years, representing a 25-30\% decline in 1 year. We
   estimated the population of Natalus tumidirostris to be 890 in 2003. We
   also found a group of 60 Pteronotus davyi in Kueba di Raton in 2003.
   Glossophaga longirostris elongata (1417 individuals counted) is the only
   species for which our data indicate relative stability over 10 years; L.
   curasoae and Mor. megalophylla are declining and other species must be
   monitored closely. Most caves are disturbed; four major caves require
   attention for the conservation of the most fragile species. Without
   immediate attention, Mor. megalophylla, in particular, risks imminent
   extinction. Despite problems associated with bat counts on Curacao, it
   is clear that regular surveys are crucial to understand bat populations
   and their fluctuations in caves, and to allow management responses to
   declines, particularly for areas undergoing rapid urbanization.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Elevated environmental pollen levels result in allergic and
   asthmatic symptoms in sensitive individuals. Objective: To present data
   collected during a 15-year period demonstrating the seasonal pollen
   variation in a metropolitan area.
   Methods: Pollen was collected daily except for weekends. Pollen counts
   were counted using light microscopy and \%vere used to calculate the
   average daily pollen count per month between March 1 and October 31 of
   each calendar year. The month in which each class of pollen reached the
   highest level (peak) was analyzed across the sampling period. Spearman p
   correlation coefficients were calculated to show changes in peak pollen
   levels across time.
   Results: The average daily pollen level (tree, grasses, and weeds) for
   each month was analyzed (1987-2002). Tree pollen peaked in May and
   composed 98.7\% of the measurable pollen between March and May. Grass
   pollen had a biphasic peak (June and September). representing 42.9\% of
   measurable pollen in July and 6.4\% in September. Weed and ragweed
   levels peaked in September. Total weed pollen constituted 93.5\% of the
   measurable pollen between August and October. The combined total pollen
   levels peaked in May. The highest annual peak tree pollen count was
   observed between 1992 and 1997, with a linear relationship between tree
   and total pollen (R-2 = 0.97); highest levels of grass pollen were
   observed between 1993 and 1997: and highest levels of weed pollen were
   observed between 1993 and 1995. A trend toward declining levels of total
   pollen was observed between 1993 and 2002. This declining trend was most
   pronounced for weed pollen.
   Conclusions: Aeroallergens pollinate sequentially, starting with trees
   in the spring, grass throughout the summer, and weeds in late summer to
   early fall. Pollen levels have declined from 1993 to the present. The
   most pronounced drop has been in weed pollen levels. Grass pollen
   demonstrates a biphasic pattern. Tree pollen composes most annual pollen
   measured in the northern New Jersey-New York City area.}},

Abstract = {{Honey bees are important avocado pollinators, but due to low
   attractiveness of avocado flowers pollination is often inadequate. Since
   honey is of nectar origin, we used it to test the effect of nectar
   composition on the preference of honey bees and we identified avocado
   honey due to its perseitol concentration. Bees preferred feeders
   containing non-avocado honey to avocado honey even when total sugar
   concentration in the avocado honey was higher. Crop loads were smaller
   for bees feeding on avocado than non-avocado honey. Finally, the
   learning performance of bees in a proboscis extension conditioning
   experiment was lower when they were rewarded with avocado honey than
   with non-avocado honey or sucrose solution. Moreover, only for avocado
   honey did the percentage of bees refusing to consume reward increase
   during the experiment. Our results indicate that honey bees prefer honey
   whose floral origin is of a competing flora over that of avocado. We
   conclude that avocado nectar composition may contribute to the low
   attractiveness of avocado flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Declines in bee populations have been documented in several parts of the
   world. Bees are dependent upon flowering plants for resources, and
   flowering plants often depend upon bees for pollination services. Bees
   can therefore serve as indicator species of habitat degradation due to
   these relationships with flowering plants. This study investigates how
   the bumble bee community in San Francisco has responded to urbanization
   and which urban park characteristics are important for the current
   community's structure. To answer these questions we. sampled bumble
   bees, in 18 urban parks and two nearby wild parks. We estimated park
   characteristics and used multiple regression analysis to determine which
   characteristics predicted bumble bee abundance and species richness.
   Bumble bee abundance was positively associated with resource
   availability or proxies of resource availability; ``natural area{''}
   (areas that contain remnant fragments that have been largely unchanged
   by human activity) in 2003 and nest site abundance and openness of the
   surrounding matrix in both 2003 and 2004. Bumble bee species richness
   was negatively associated with abundance of a dominant species, Bombus
   vosnesenskii, in 2004. The importance of the surrounding matrix suggests
   that these parks do not act as islands. Accordingly, area of park did
   not explain species richness, while abundance of the dominant competitor
   did. The species that was most influenced by competition, Bombus
   sitkensis, uses rodent holes as nest sites and is possibly excluded from
   nest sites by the early emerging B. vosnesenskii, another subterranean
   nester. The species least influenced by competition, Bombus melanopygus,
   is able to use both rodent holes and abandoned bird nests as nest sites.

Abstract = {{Native plants in gardens can potentially aid conservation by
   contributing to genetic diversity and buffering small and otherwise
   isolated populations from extinction. However, gene flow from such
   plantings may threaten the genetic integrity of natural populations. We
   assessed the morphological and genetic diversity of garden plants in an
   urban population of Grevillea macleayana in south-eastern Australia.
   There were two main groups of garden plants: some similar to plants in
   nearby natural populations; others with unusual morphology. Multivariate
   analysis of morphological characters separated these groupings, which
   were confirmed by genetic analysis. Both groups produced seeds and
   flowering phenologies overlapped, indicating a potential for gene flow.
   Hand pollination showed that plants in each group could fertilize
   flowers of the other. Thus, these garden plants contributed to genetic
   variation in an urban/bushland metapopulation but there was potential
   for gene flow from the unusual plants. Unless carefully managed, garden
   plants may therefore cause disruption of the genetic integrity of nearby

Title = {{Complex responses within a desert bee guild (Hymenoptera : Apiformes) to

Abstract = {{Urbanization within the Tucson Basin of Arizona during the past 5 years
   has fragmented the original desert scrub into patches of different sizes
   and ages. These remnant patches and the surrounding desert are dominated
   by Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), a long-lived shrub whose flowers
   are visited by > 120 native bee species across its range. Twenty-one of
   these bee species restrict their pollen foraging to L. tridentata. To
   evaluate the response of this bee fauna to fragmentation, we compared
   species incidence and abundance patterns for the bee guild visiting L.
   tridentata at 59 habitat fragments of known size (0.002-5 ha) and age
   (up to 70 years), and in adjacent desert.
   The 62 bee species caught during this study responded to fragmentation
   heterogeneously and not in direct relation to their abundance or
   incidence in undisturbed desert. Few species found outside the city were
   entirely absent from urban fragments. Species of ground-nesting L.
   tridentata specialists were underrepresented in smaller fragments and
   less abundant in the smaller and older fragments. In contrast,
   cavity-nesting bees (including one L. tridentata specialist) were
   overrepresented in the habitat fragments., probably due to enhanced
   nesting opportunities available in the urban matrix. Small-bodied bee
   species were no more likely than larger bodied species to be absent from
   the smaller fragments. The introduced European honey bee, Apis
   mellifera, was a minor faunal element at > 90\% of the fragments and
   exerted little if any influence on the response of native bee species to
   fragmentation. Overall, bee response to urban habitat fragmentation was
   best predicted by ecological traits associated with nesting and dietary
   breadth. Had species been treated as individual units in the analyses,
   or pooled together into one analysis, these response patterns may not
   have been apparent. Pollination interactions with this floral host are
   probably not adversely affected in this system because of its longevity
   and ability to attract diverse pollinators but will demand careful
   further study to understand.}},

Title = {{The relationship between pollen and extant vegetation across an arid
   urban ecosystem and surrounding desert in Southwest USA}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{573-591}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Aim In this paper, we explore the relationship between pollen
   concentration in surface soil and extant perennial vegetation across a
   rapidly urbanizing arid ecosystem along with its surrounding
   agricultural and native Sonoran Desert land. We also investigate whether
   taxa behave as expected from known pollination characteristics (e.g.
   anemophilous vs. zoophilous) and whether the pollen-plant relationship
   differs between the undeveloped desert and agro-urban regions.
   Location We used a probability-based sampling scheme at 200, 900-m(2)
   sites across the Central Arizona-Phoenix region, a 6400-km(2) area of
   the south-western USA.
   Methods Pollen-plant abundances were mapped across the study area using
   interpolation techniques, summary bar charts and scatterplots, then two
   statistical approaches were applied to examine the data quantitatively.
   Firstly, we used regression analysis of paired pollen concentration and
   plant cover data; secondly, PC-ORD was used on a cross-matrix
   (contingency table) containing the presence/absence scores of both
   pollen and plants for each taxon at each site.
   Results Mapping and quantitative analysis revealed that pollen-plant
   relationships do vary both between anemophilous and zoophilous groupings
   and by individual taxon. They also revealed that distribution patterns
   of both pollen and plant abundance vary consistently across the three
   main landscape types (desert, urban, agricultural) and that pollen taxa
   groupings are consistent with pollination method and source plant
   distribution regardless of landscape type.
   Main conclusions These findings provide a broad range of comparative
   data to facilitate palynological reconstruction of past vegetation and
   aid in assessing types of prehistoric impacts on this vegetation. They
   also document that significant variation can occur in pollen rain across
   a city, even for taxa with widely distributed pollen, leading to the
   conclusion that forecasting pollen distribution patterns for
   allergy-related pollen types using only one or a few pollen traps is
   likely to entail substantial error.}},

Abstract = {{Toledo is one of the main tourist spots of Spain, attracting around two
   million visitors per year. Its geographical situation in the vast and
   scarcely monitored Region of Castilla La Mancha and the high number of
   tourists (especially in the spring) has resulted in the Spanish
   Aerobiology Network (REA) making this city a major study objective. Air
   monitoring studies carried out using REA sampling procedures commenced
   in October 2002. Thirty-two pollen types were identified during the
   sampling period (October 2002 to October 2004). The annual Pollen Index
   (PI) was 44124 for the agricultural year October 2002-October 2003, and
   29666 in the same period of 2003-2004. The most abundant taxa were, in
   decreasing order of dominance: Cupressaceae, Quercus, Poaceae, Populus,
   Olea, Urticaceae, Platanus, Pinus and Ulmus. Other, less
   well-represented pollen taxa included Salix, Alnus, Fraxinus and
   Tamarix, which were characteristic of riverside areas, and Morus,
   Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae. The presence of Castanea pollen grains
   originating from chestnut crops far away from the city was clearly an
   example of long-distance transport. The highest concentrations of
   airborne pollen were detected from March to May and also in January, due
   to the flowering of Cupressaceae species. In general, there was a
   correlation between pollen and meteorological parameters: a positive
   correlation with temperature and a negative correlation with rainfall
   and humidity during the pre-peak period. A negative correlation between
   temperature and some tree pollen taxa was detected in the principal
   pollen period correlation analysis due to their long pollination
   periods.}},

Abstract = {{This field study investigated the relationship between indoor and

   the Cincinnati area (overall, 15 pairs of samples were taken in each
   home). The measurements were conducted during three seasons - spring and
   fall 2004, and winter 2005. The concentration of culturable
   actinomycetes was mostly below the detection limit. The median
   indoor/outdoor ratio (I/O) for actinomycetes was the highest: 2.857. The
   indoor of fungal and pollen concentrations followed the outdoor
   concentrations while indoor levels were mostly lower than the outdoor
   ones. The I/O ratio of total fungal spores (median = 0.345) in six homes
   was greater than that of pollen grains (median = 0.025). The low I/O
   ratios obtained for pollen during the peak ambient pollination season
   (spring) suggest that only a small fraction penetrated from outdoor to
   indoor environment. This is attributed to the larger size of pollen
   grains. Higher indoor concentration levels and variability in the I/O
   ratio observed for airborne fungi may be associated with indoor sources
   and/or higher outdoor-to-indoor penetration of fungal spores compared to
   pollen grains.}},

Abstract = {{1. Over the last decade, there has been much concern about the decline
   in pollinator abundance and diversity caused by different types of
   anthropogenic disturbances, including deforestation and habitat
   fragmentation. However, little empirical information exists documenting
   this decline and its consequences for cultivated flowering crops. We
   tested the hypothesis that remnants of natural habitats act as a source
   of flower-visiting insects for neighbourhood crops.
   2. Over 3 consecutive years we evaluated flower-visiting insect
   diversity, visitation frequency and composition in four grapefruit
   Citrus paradisi Macf. plantations at increasing distances (edge, 10,
   100, 500 and 1000 m) from remnants of subtropical premontane forest in
   NW Argentina.
   3. The frequency of visits to grapefruit flowers decreased by more than
   twofold as distance to the forest increased and the flower-visiting
   fauna became more depaupurate. Even the feral africanized honeybee Apis
   mellifera, the dominant flower visitor to grapefruit flowers, showed a
   decline at distances > 500 m from the forest edge. However, the greatest
   relative declines occurred among stingless and solitary bees as well as
   other native flower visitors, which were rarely seen a few hundred
   metres inside the plantations. In addition, flower-visiting insect
   faunas among plantations became more homogeneous as distance from the
   edge increased.
   4. These trends were consistent over years and among plantations up to
   50 km apart. Thus, we can conclude that negative forest edge effects on
   flower-visiting insects inside grapefruit plantations are widespread in
   the increasingly deforested landscape of NW Argentina.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study provides empirical evidence
   for considering remnants of natural habitats as a source of both native
   and alien flower-visiting insects that can be potential pollinators for
   agriculture. Increasing edge density in agricultural lands, through
   preservation and restoration of natural habitats, can foster stocks of
   diverse and abundant insect pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Ever since a feral population of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris was
   found in suburban Hobart, on the Australian island of Tasmania, there
   has been ongoing debate surrounding the capacity of this species to
   utilise Australian native vegetation. Although several studies have
   reported B. terrestris foraging on Tasmanian native vegetation, doubts
   have been raised as to whether this reflects successful breeding in
   native vegetation. This study documents the success of a colony of B.
   terrestris in a Tasmanian National Park, isolated from urban and
   agricultural areas by 10 km of sea. Examination of the larval cocoons
   revealed that this colony had produced at least 304 new queens and 939
   workers and drones. Pollen stores found in the colony were mostly from
   native plants, particularly Eucalyptus. These results strongly suggest
   that B. terrestris is able to reproduce successfully in parts of
   Australia that still support almost exclusively native vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Madagascar has a distinctive fruit bar community consisting of Pteropus

   we observed fruit bat visits to flowering baobabs (Adansonia suarezensis
   and Adansonia grandideri) and kapok trees (Ceiba pentandra) during the
   austral winter. Eidolon dupreanum was recorded feeding on the nectar of
   baobabs and kapok, P rufus was observed Feeding oil kapok only and no R.
   madagascariensis were seen. Three mammals species, two small lemurs
   (Phaner furcifer and Mirza coquereli) and E. dupreanum, made
   nondestructive visits to flowering A. grandidieri and are therefore all
   potential pollinators of this endangered baobab. This is the first
   evidence to show that A. grandidieri is bit-pollinated and Further
   demonstrates the close link between fruit bats and some of Madagascars
   endemic plants. Eidolon dupreanum was the only mammal species recorded
   visiting A. suarezensis and visits peaked at the reported limes of
   maximum nectar concentration. Pteropus rufus visited kapok mostly before
   midnight when most nectar was available, but E. dupreanum visited later
   in the night. These differences in timing of foraging on kapok can be
   explained either by differing distances from the roost sites of each
   species or by resource partitioning. We advocate increased levels of
   protection, education awareness, and applied research oil both
   mammal-pollinated baobab species and fruit bats, and suggest that both
   baobabs and bats are candidate ``flagship species{''} for the threatened

Abstract = {{Hong Kong (22 degrees N) is on the northern margins of the Asian tropics
   and has a native fig flora of 24 species. A total of 3.4 km(2) of the
   urban area on Hong Kong Island was surveyed for spontaneous and planted
   fig plants of reproductive size. The 1124 individuals included 14
   species in four subgenera: seven native species (F. fistulosa, F. hirta,
   F. hispida, F. microcarap, F. pumila, F. subpisocarpa, and F.
   variegata), four of which were sometimes planted, one probably native
   (F. virens), one naturalizing species (F. religiosa), and five exotic
   species that occurred only in cultivation, two of which (F. altissima,
   F. rumphii) are pollinated and produce viable seeds. The native species
   in the two most common subgenera form distinct ecological guilds: those
   in subgenus Sycomorus bear large, many seeded, green or yellow figs and
   are bat-dispersed pioneers on exposed soil; those in subgenus Urostigma
   bear small, few-seeded, dark-purple figs and are largely bird-dispersed
   and epilithic. The density of potentially fruiting fig plants in the
   study area (2.3/ha) was within the range reported for tropical forests
   and between them they were visited by the entire urban frugivore fauna.
   This study shows the importance of the urban fig flora to urban wildlife
   and also highlights the risk of cultivated Ficus species becoming
   invasive, despite their obligate species-specific pollinator mutualisms.}},

Journal = {{FLORA}},

Volume = {{201}},

Abstract = {{Citharexylum myrianthum is an example of cryptic dioecy in
   morphologically perfect flowers. Flowers are small, tubular,
   white-colored, and crepuscular, with a sweet, pleasant scent and occur
   in raceme-like inflorescences. Functionally, male flowers have a less
   developed ovary and females have anthers lacking pollen. They are
   pollinated by five species of Sphingidae. The low fruit set under
   natural conditions, compared with the very high fruit set after
   hand-pollination, apart from other possible factors, suggests that
   pollen flow is limited mainly by pollinators. The overabundance of
   nectar provided by C myrianthum flowers attracts a large number of
   opportunistic nectar foragers in the morning. Hummingbirds, the most
   frequent visitors, are nectar thieves and display territorialism, being
   aggressive even to Passeriformes. Despite its visitor diversity C
   myrianthum is pollinated by sphingids, and in this sense this species is
   a specialist rather than a generalist. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that fragmentation effects on pollinators may
   drive plant species to extinction even if their immediate habitats are
   not affected. We hypothesize that species at high risk of suffering this
   ``pollination crisis{''} are characterized by the following set of
   traits: self-incompatibility with synchronous flowering; reliance on a
   small number of pollinator species whose pollinators are specialists;
   and the existence of only a few, sparse populations. Iris bismarckiana
   fits this description perfectly. We studied two populations separated by
   recent urban development in order to (a) determine if the species is
   suffering a ``pollination crisis{''}, (b) assess which stage of the
   process limits reproductive success, and (c) evaluate artificial
   pollination as a viable conservation means for this species. We
   performed pollination experiments in two populations of I. bismarckiana.
   The overall natural fruit-set of open-pollinated inflorescences was
   around 13\%, while supplementary cross-pollination by pollen from the
   same population substantially increased the fruit-set to 44\%. An even
   greater fruit-set of 78\% resulted from cross-pollination with pollen
   from the second population. Artificial cross-pollination also increased
   the number of seeds per capsule. Our results suggest that fragmentation
   may link the effects of inbreeding depression and pollinator activity to
   generate a ``pollination crisis{''}, expressed as significant reduction
   in sexual reproduction. We propose that supplementary cross-pollination,
   as well as transplanting of seeds, seedlings, and adult plants, may
   increase seed production and improve the survival chances of I.
   bismarckiana.}},

Abstract = {{Ornamental plants cultivated in urban regions may help to sustain local

   This 3-year study examined the abundance of flowering, nectar and pollen
   production as well as insect visitation to six ornamental Deutzia
   species and cultivars. In Poland, the blooming of the observed taxa
   lasted from early June to the end of July. The number of developed
   florets strongly depended on the weather conditions before and during
   the flowering period. All deutzias showed abundant secretion of highly
   concentrated nectar. The mean amount of sugars secreted in nectar per 10
   flowers ranged from 11.8 mg (D. scabra) to 18.7 mg (D. gracilis).
   Average pollen mass produced by the same number of florets was similar
   in all species and reached 17.8 mg. The highest estimated nectar (71.1
   g) and pollen (74.1 g) crop per plant was obtained from D. scabra cv.
   Watereri. Deutzia flowers attracted numerous insects, mainly honey bees,
   bumble bees and solitary bees. The species and cultivars investigated
   are highly valuable honey plants. Increased use of these shrubs in
   gardens and parks should be encouraged in order to enrich nectar and
   pollen pasture for honey bees and wild Apoidea. However, their use is
   limited to areas of mild climate and adequate water supply.}},

Abstract = {{The urban environment was used to study the plant reproductive system in
   small fragmented populations as well as the potential adaptations of
   plants to urban conditions. We examined the effect of density on the
   pollination process and on reproduction in urban populations of the
   allogamous species Crepis sancta. The habitat is composed of small
   uncultivated square patches (c. 2 m(2)) regularly spaced along the
   pavement in streets of the city of Montpellier, France.
   Pollinator behaviour (the presence of pollinators, the number of flowers
   visited and the duration of each visit) and seed set as a function of
   the number of plants in patches and selfing rates, determined using
   progeny array analysis, were studied. The propensity for the urban
   populations to produce seeds by self-fertilization in insect-proof
   glasshouse was also analysed.
   We found strong evidence of reduced pollinator activities at low
   densities, resulting in reduced pollination and a reduction in seed set
   from 80 to 20\% of ovules fertilized (the Allee effect).
   Progeny array analysis revealed a slight increase (marginally
   significant) in selfing rates in urban populations compared with large
   populations. In spite of lower pollinator activity, urban populations
   did not show a greater ability to self-fertilize compared with rural
   populations from the nearby countryside.}},

Abstract = {{In Japan, one of the major problems in producing high quality blueberry
   fruit is that the harvesting season of many highbush blueberry cultivars
   occurs during the rainy season (June and July). For this reason, some
   growers are interested in forcing blueberries into producing mature
   fruit before the rainy season begins. In this study, many cultivars with
   a low chilling requirement, `Bladen', `Blue Ridge', `Cape Fear',
   `Cooper', `Duplin', `Flordablue', `Georgiagem', `Magnolia', `Misty',
   `O'Neal', `Reveille', `Sharpblue' and `Summit' (southern highbush
   blueberry -SHb), `Weymouth' (northern highbush -NHb) and `Climax'
   (rabbiteye blueberry -Rb) controls were used. The flowering and
   harvesting time, fruit set, yield and fruit quality parameters were
   investigated. Potted 3 to 4-year-old old plants were transferred from
   outdoors into a plastic film greenhouse on 10 Feb. 2002 and 20 Jan. 2003
   (used different plants each year). Temperature was maintained between 10
   degrees C-35 degrees C with heating continued through 10 May each year.
   A small bee colony was provided for pollination during the flowering
   period. Both flowering and harvesting times were advanced 30-40 days
   under heated culture as compared to the natural environment. When
   comparing the cultivars, 20\% of the total fruit yield was harvested
   earliest in `Weymouth' during the last week of April, followed by
   `Cooper', `Blue Ridge', `Reveille', `O'Neal', `Bladen', `Misty',
   `Flordablue', `Georgiagem', and `Sharpblue'. `Climax' was the latest
   with 20\% of yield harvested on the last week of June. Harvest of all
   cultivars except `Climax' was completed by the last week of May (before
   the rainy season). Higher fruit set (over 75\%, harvested fruit /
   flower) and higher fruit yield were obtained on `Bladen', `Blue Ridge',
   `Cape Fear', `Flordablue', `Georgiagem', `Reveille' and `Sharpbluel.
   Fruit size was larger (over 2.0g per fruit at 20\% harvest time) on
   `Blue Ridge', `Cooper', `Magnolia', `Misty' and `Summit'than on
   `Bladen', `Reveille' and `Climax'(under 1.4g).'Duplin', `Georgiagem',
   `Magnolia', `O'Neal' and `Climax' had higher soluble solids (over 12\%)
   content. The highest concentration of citric acid, and lowest fruit pH
   was found in `Blue Ridge'. Considering the harvest time, percent fruit
   set, yield, fruit size and taste, `Blue Ridge', `Flordablue',
   `Georgiagem', `Misty' and `Sharpblue' southern highbush blueberry are
   recommended for forcing culture in Japan.}},

Abstract = {{This is a review of the recent advances in genetic improvement of walnut
   cultivars and rootstocks. There has been an active walnut breeding
   program at UC Davis since 1948. `Chandler', `Howard', `Vina', `Tulare'
   and `Serr' are examples of cultivars released by the program. Recently,
   three new cultivars, ('Sexton', `Gillet' and `Forde'), were released
   (patent pending). These cultivars, developed through controlled
   pollinations, are characterized by high early yields, low blight scores,
   large light-colored kernels and harvest dates before Chandler. Several
   cultivar selections for hypersensitivity to the cherry leafroll virus,
   causal agent of blackline disease, have also been made. These are
   derived from two to three generations of backcross breeding from Paradox
   (Juglans hindsii x J regia) with J. regia as the recurrent parent.
   Superior clonal Paradox rootstock selections have been identified and
   are in retesting or field trials. These include an extremely vigorous
   individual that appears to tolerate nematode (Pratylenchus vulnus)
   infestation, but is not resistant per se, 5 selections of a vigorous
   blackline-tolerant hybrid (J hindsh x J. regia) x J regia, three clones
   that are less damaged than others by Phytophthora citricola in
   greenhouse tests, and one clone that exhibits limited gall formation
   when challenged by (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) in preliminary tests.
   Genetic engineering through gene silencing has also resulted in clones
   that do not exhibit crown galls after inoculation in vitro. Many
   different researchers have been involved in the efforts to genetically
   improve walnuts.}},

Abstract = {{There is much interest in seedless watermelons in the consumer market.
   Soft X-ray irradiated pollen and CPPU hormone were evaluated to produce
   diploid seedless watermelon. Pollen was irradiated with soft X-ray at
   800 Gy before pollination. Three concentrations of CPPU were applied as
   50 ppm sprayed on ovary, 100 ppm rubbed on female flower pedicel and
   1000 ppm applied on both sides of the shoot near female flower
   attachment. Seedlessness was almost similar in all CPPU treatments (95
   \%). TSS and rind thickness was slightly higher in CPPU treated fruits
   than in the control. Similarly X-ray irradiated pollen also depicted
   higher TSS (12.0 Bx) than the control (10.8) but yielded similar fruit
   weight. However, higher concentration of CPPU showed cracks in fruits
   (95 \%). In a second set of experiments CPPU (50 ppm), soft X-ray
   irradiated pollen (800 Gy) and a combined application of X-ray (800 Gy)
   pollen and CPPU (50 ppm) were compared. The combined application yielded
   more fruit set (90 \%), seedlessness (95 \%), TSS (11.8 Bx) and
   marketable fruits (90 \%). CPPU (50 ppm) showed higher rind thickness
   (13.7 mm), harvest time (50 days after anthesis) and large aborted seeds
   than the X-ray treatment. This also indicated high sink strength up to
   15 days post anthesis but over all fruit weight was at par.}},

Abstract = {{Urban green spaces provide socially valuable ecosystem services. Through
   an historical analysis of the development of the National Urban Park
   (NUP) of Stockholm, we illustrate how the co-evolutionary process of
   humans and nature has resulted in the high level of biological diversity
   and associated recreational services found in the park. The ecological
   values of the area are generated in the cultural landscape. External
   pressures resulting in urban sprawl in the Stockholm metropolitan region
   increasingly challenge the capacity of the NUP to continue to generate
   valuable ecosystem services. Setting aside protected areas, without
   accounting for the role of human stewardship of the cultural landscape,
   will most likely fail. In a social inventory of the area, we identify 69
   local user and interest groups currently involved in the NUP area. Of
   these, 25 are local stewardship associations that have a direct role in
   managing habitats within the park that sustain such services as
   recreational landscapes, seed dispersal, and pollination. We propose
   that incentives should be created to widen the current biodiversity
   management paradigm, and actively engage local stewardship associations
   in adaptive co-management processes of the park and surrounding green

Abstract = {{Humans depend on ecosystem services, yet our ecological understanding of

   decided to protect the Catskill Watershed rather than build an expensive

   be the cheaper option, even if they underestimated the area required by
   half. Such reasoning reflects our inability to predict how to manage
   lands to provide ecosystem services of sufficient quantity and quality.
   Human domination of the biosphere is rapidly altering the capacity of
   ecosystems to provide a variety of essential services; we therefore need
   to develop a better understanding of their ecological underpinnings, and
   to integrate this knowledge into a socioeconomic context to develop
   better policies and plans to manage them. We present a three-part

Abstract = {{Interploid crosses of diploid Kinnow mandarin, Succari sweet orange and
   Sweet lime with tetraploid Kinnow were made reciprocally for the
   production of triploid plants. Low fruit set and occurrence of
   underdeveloped or empty seeds was common in all interploid crosses. The
   hybrid fruits harvested after 12-14 weeks or 7 months after pollination
   produced many underdeveloped and few developed seeds; however,
   tetraploid Kinnow as seed parent yielded more developed seeds per fruit.
   The under developed seeds were devoid of endosperm. Nucellar embryony
   was higher in the diploid than in the tetraploid strain of Kinnow.
   Immature embryos of seeds harvested 12-14 weeks after pollination were
   cultured in vitro on MS media supplemented with adenine sulphate (20 mg
   l(-1)) and malt extract (500 mg l(-1)). Maximum germination (75\%) of
   hybrid embryos from underdeveloped seeds was obtained in 4x x 2x cross
   of Kinnow strains. The germinated plantlets were transferred into pots
   and noted 59-89.3\% survival rate in various crosses. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The pollinic data base of the RNSA makes it possible to follow the
   influence on pollination that weather modifications in France may have
   had over a period of more than 15 years. The climate of a particular
   place can be characterized by its latitude, its distance from the ocean
   and its topography. Climate can have number of actions on pollination:
   Direct action of CO, on the growth of plants; a mild winter can lead to
   early flowering of trees; precipitation and relative humidity can
   influence the sedimentation of pollen; air pollution can modify the
   allergenic potential of pollen; and modification of the sensitivity of
   allergic individuals. Using RNSA data going back to 1987, it was
   possible to establish curves on the evolution of the starting date of
   pollination of the principal allergenic taxa, of the duration of this
   pollination, and of the number of days with significant allergic risk in
   a number of French cities. In the majority of the sites studied, it was
   observed that the beginning of tree pollination is becoming
   progressively earlier, going from just a few days in 1987 to more than
   20 days earlier in 2003. Furthermore, the duration of tree pollination
   is in general becoming longer in all the sites studied, from just a few
   to more than 20 days. The evolution of the number of days that the
   allergic risk related to pollens is judged to be average, high or very
   high was found to vary considerably over the period studied, going from
   just a few days longer to a doubling of the number of days between 1987
   and 2003. For grass pollen and ambrosia pollen, the onset of pollination
   was not significantly different over this period. On the other hand, the
   number of days with an average allergic risk level going to a higher
   risk level was found to have increased between 1987 and 2004. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The seed coat serves as a multifunctional organ with a role in
   protection and for the supply of nutrients to the embryo sac during
   development. The composition of the legume seed coat differs from other
   seed tissues in many ways including its protein composition. An abundant
   24 kDa protein (SC24) has been purified and identified from soybean
   (Glycine max {[}L.] Merr) seed hulls. The corresponding cDNA and genomic
   DNA clones for SC24 were isolated and characterized, and expression
   patterns were determined. The deduced protein sequence of 219 amino
   acids included an N-terminal signal peptide. Transcripts encoding SC24
   were present in the seed coat from 30 days after pollination (DAP) until
   maturity, but the protein was not detected until the final stages of
   seed maturation. In mature seeds, most of the SC24 protein was localized
   to the parenchyma and aleurone layers of the seed coat. The expression
   of SC24 was also induced in vegetative tissues by pathogen infection and
   by wounding. The SC24 protein bound to an affinity column containing an
   isophthalic acid ligand, and was eluted with 7 mM citrate. Polyclonal
   antibodies raised against recombinant SC24 cross-reacted with the seed
   coat peroxidase enzyme, suggesting that these two proteins may share an
   antigenic determinant. Overall, the results indicate that SC24 belongs
   to a novel class of plant defence proteins with carboxylate-binding
   activity.}},

Abstract = {{In fig wasps, mating occurs among the offspring of one or a few
   foundress mothers within the fig, from which the mated females disperse
   to found new broods. Under these conditions, males will compete with
   each other for mating, and such local mate competition can result in
   female-biased sex ratios. In addition to pollinating wasps,
   non-pollinating wasp species are also associated with figs and develop
   in flower ovaries or parasitize the larvae of primary galling wasps.
   While studying the fig wasp Pegoscapus tonduzi, which pollinates Ficus
   citrifolia in Brazil, we examined the influence of non-pollinating fig
   wasps on the sex ratio of species that pollinate F. citrifolia to
   determine whether the presence of non-pollinating wasps resulted in a
   distorted sex ratio. There was a positive relationship between the sex
   ratio of P. tonduzi and the number of non-pollinating wasps that was
   independent of the number of foundresses and brood size. In addition,
   the number of non-pollinating wasps correlated negatively with the
   number of pollinating females, but was not significantly related to the
   number of pollinating males. This finding suggested that non-pollinating
   wasps had a direct effect in distorting the sex ratio of P. tonduzi
   broods. Our results indicate that the secondary sex ratio may not
   precisely reflect the primary sex ratio when there is a high infestation
   of non-pollinating fig wasps.}},

Abstract = {{In 1990 the Africanized honey bee, a descendent of Apis mellifera
   scutellata, was identified in south Texas {[}Hunter, L.A., Jackman,
   J.A., Sugden, E.A., 1992. Detection records of Africanized honey bees in
   Texas during 1990,1991 and 1992. Southwestern Entomol. 18, 79-89]. The
   potential impact of this immigrant on feral and managed colonies was the
   subject of considerable speculation. The goal of this study was to
   investigate the diversity of feral honey bee races in pine forest
   landscapes of east Texas, subsequent to immigration of A. m. scutellata.
   The specific objectives were (i) to assess the immigration of A. m.
   scutellata into east Texas pine forest landscapes and (ii) to evaluate
   the suitability of the pine forest landscape to feral honey bees. This
   mesoscale landscape study was conducted on the Sam Houston National
   Forest in east Texas. Swarm traps and aerial pitfall traps were used to
   monitor feral honey bees. Spatial databases were used to evaluate
   suitability of the pine forest landscape for honey bees.
   Scoring mitochondrial DNA type (mitotypes), we found representatives of
   A. mellifera scutellata, eastern European, western European, and A.
   mellifera lamarckii races in pine forest landscapes of east Texas. The
   conclusions that follow from this aspect of the investigation are (i)
   honey bees are a ubiquitous component of the pine forest landscape in
   east Texas, (ii) mitotype diversity persists subsequent to the
   immigration of A. rn. scutellata, and (iii) A. m. scutellata is an added
   element of the mitotype diversity in the landscape.
   To evaluate quantitatively the suitability of the pine forest to feral
   honey bees, we used a spatial database for the study area and FRAGSTATS.
   The landscape structure in 1256 ha units surrounding six swarms of honey
   bees captured in the swarm traps was examined. The metrics used to
   characterize the kind, number, size, shape, and configuration of
   elements forming the landscape, defined a heterogeneous environment for
   honey bees that included sufficient food and habitat resources needed
   for survival, growth, and reproduction. The conclusions that follow from
   this aspect of the investigation are (1) although classified as a pine
   forest, management practices and other human activities have altered the
   landscape and thereby created food and habitat resources suitable for
   honey bees, (2) the forestry practices associated specifically with road
   corridor maintenance, stream side corridor protection, RCW management,
   and Wilderness Area management introduce structural heterogeneity to the
   forest landscape which enriches the diversity and abundance of early
   successional flowering plants and provides cavity sites needed by honey
   bees, (3) ranching, fanning, and urbanization within the study area also
   create these conditions, and (4) based on inferences from
   melissopalynology, honey bees provide pollination services for a broad
   representation of native and introduced flowering plant species of the
   pineywoods ecoregion. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) are important pollinators of triploid

   production since staminate flowers contain mostly nonviable pollen. Six
   honey bee visitation treatments-1) no visitation control, 2) two visits,

   plot compared to all other honey bee visitation treatments. Fruit set,
   and fruit numbers and weights per plot increased linearly as number of
   honey bee visits to pistillate flowers increased from 0 (no visit
   control) to the open-pollinated control (about 24 visits). This study
   indicated that between 16 and 24 honey bee visits are required to
   achieve maximum triploid watermelon fruit set and yields at a 33\%
   pollenizer frequency, which is twice the number of honey bee visits
   required by seeded watermelons to achieve similar results. This is
   probably due to many honey bees visiting staminate triploid watermelon
   flowers (that are in close proximity) before visiting pistillate flowers
   thus providing mostly nonviable pollen that is useless for fruit set and
   development. Therefore, more honey bee visits to pistillate triploid
   watermelon flowers would be required to achieve maximum fruit set and
   subsequent development compared to seeded watermelons.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of native pollinators in agricultural systems,
   little is known about the potential competitive interactions among them
   or the way they exploit crops' floral resources. This study determines
   the temporal use of floral resources by, and interspecific interactions
   between, native bees and Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in
   experimental plots of squash, Cucurbita moschata (Duchesne ex Lam.)
   Duchesne ex Poir. (Cucurbitaceae), and watermelon, Citrullus lanatus
   (Thimb.) (Cucurbitaceae). General and specific niche overlap analyses
   were done to determine whether temporally differential use of floral
   resources occurred. Direct displacement interactions at the floral level
   were quantified. The species with the greatest abundances were Peponapis
   limitaris Cockerell (Apidae), Partamona bilineata Say (Apidae), and A.
   mellifera. Overall, the niche overlap analyses in both crops suggested
   that floral resources are not used simultaneously by different bee
   species. Winner events during aggressive encounters suggested a
   hierarchy among bee species, with A. mellifera being one of the species
   with more winner encounters in both crops. It is suggested that those
   deciding whether or not to introduce A. mellifera into crops should
   consider whether the abundance of native bee species is sufficient to
   ensure efficient fruit production.}},

Abstract = {{Several species of the Erica genus are broadly represented in northwest
   Spain, being among the shrubs that form the substitution stage following
   forest degradation as a result of human activity, caused mainly by fire
   or other antrophic causes. Therefore airborne pollen from Erica is
   frequent. From 1995 to 2002, an aerobiological study of Ericaceae family
   pollen was undertaken in the atmosphere of the city of Vigo (Northwest
   Spain) using a Lanzoni VPPS 2000 (Lanzoni srl, Bologna, Italy) sampler
   placed in the left margin of the Vigo fiord (42 degrees 14'15 `' N, 8
   degrees 43'30 `' W). Despite being a taxon of eminently entomophillous
   pollination, the pollen of Ericaceae was well represented in the
   atmosphere above the study zone. Erica arborea L. is the main species
   represented in the annual pollen curve. This taxon shows a long main
   pollen season and higher pollen concentrations were recorded during the
   months of April and May, which is why beekeepers place their beehives at
   specific locations in April to ensure a considerable contribution from
   this pollen to the composition of the honey. The maximum daily average
   concentration was detected in 1997, with a concentration of 156
   grains/m(3). Throughout the day, maximum values occur at 5/6 h and
   between 17:00 and 18:00 h. Finally, correlation statistical analyses
   were developed in order to determine the degree of association between
   the daily average of meteorological parameters and daily mean airborne
   pollen concentrations. Rainfall exerts a clear influence on Ericaceae
   pollen season characteristics, with precipitation registered in March
   being responsible for the decrease in total annual pollen values.}},

Abstract = {{Production of seedless mandarins such as `Nules' clementine mandarin
   (Citrus clementina Hort. Ex Tan.) and `Afourer' mandarin {[}C. sinensis
   (L.) Osbeck x C. reticulata Blanco] is increasing in California as
   consumers' interest in seedless, easy peeling, and good tasting
   mandarins increases. The fruit would produce seeds if cross-pollination
   with compatible pollen source occurred. It is almost impossible to
   prevent cross-pollination between compatible mandarin cultivars by
   honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) within the multi-faceted agricultural
   environment in California. To produce seedless mandarin, growers either
   plant a single cultivar in a large solid block or try to use
   pollen-sterile navel oranges (C. sinensis) or satsuma mandarins (C.
   unshiu Marco.) as buffers to prevent cross-pollination. The question of
   how many rows of buffer trees or spacing can effectively prevent
   cross-pollination by honeybees between compatible mandarins is unclear.
   We initiated a study using fluorescent-labeled AFLP markers to determine
   the pollen parentages of `Nules' clementine seedlings and `Afourer'
   mandarin seedlings from two orchards in California. The longest distance
   of pollen flow at an orchard near Madera was 521 m. The pollen of
   `Minneola' tangelo (C. reticulata x C. paradisi Macf.) was able to
   disperse across a minimum of 92 rows of `Lane Late' navel oranges plus
   two rows of `Afourer' mandarins to pollinate `Afourer' mandarins. We
   also found that all the seedlings of `Nules' clementine mandarin at an
   orchard near Bakersfield had been pollinated by `Afourer' mandarin
   pollen. The pollen of `Afourer' mandarin was able to disperse up to
   distances between 837 and 960 m to pollinate `Nules' clementine. The
   pollen dispersal distance found in this study was at least 16 times
   longer than previously reported in a citrus orchard. Growers need to
   consider a much larger space or buffer rows to prevent cross-pollination
   and produce seedless mandarins in California.}},

Abstract = {{In 1999, bees were sampled from several flowering individuals of the
   leguminous tree, Andira inermis (Papilionoideae), at two sites in
   northwestern Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica. One site, city outskirts
   of Liberia, was experiencing steady encroachment of human development,
   whereas the other was a moderately impacted cattle ranch/wildland area
   near the small town of Bagaces. A standardized method was employed to
   sample the bees, which had been used previously in 1996 in the same tree
   populations at the same two sites (Frankie et al., 1997).
   Results of the 1999 samples were compared with those taken in 1996 to
   examine possible changes in bee diversity and abundance. During this
   three-year period, El Nino and La Nina climatic events had occurred
   back-to-back, and this combination of weather patterns provided an
   opportunity to evaluate possible short-term changes in the bee taxa that
   use A. inermis as one of their preferred host plants. Other bee host
   plants at both sites were also surveyed for seasonal flowering, the
   results of which formed a broader context for assessing the A. inermis
   bee samples.
   The comparison revealed the follwing. 1) The composition of bees had
   changed with reductions in large bees from 1996 to 1999; most noticeably
   some anthophorids and especially Centris and Epicharis. Africanized
   honey bees and smaller bee taxa remained about the same in composition
   and overall abundance. 2) During El Nino and La Nina years from mid 1997
   through early 1999, the flowering of key resources for large bees,
   especially Byrsonima crassifolia, was substantially delayed (and
   sometimes reduced) to the point where building and provisioning of bee
   nests was likely reduced, which apparently led to declines in large bee
   taxa. Other possible causes of decline, including increasing
   agricultural development in the region, are also discussed. 3) Intertree
   variation in attraction of bees to A. inermis was documented in both
   1999 and 1996, but persistence of this variable attraction on the same
   individual trees could be only partially evaluated in 1999. The
   flowering pattern(s) of individual A. inermis trees has proved to be
   highly variable within and between the two study sites.}},

Abstract = {{In 2004, the first Ficus microcarpa seedlings were observed
   self-establishing in Brisbane, Queensland. Prior to this the only F
   microcarpa in the city were cultivated specimens. This
   self-establishment is a certain indicator of the presence of Eupristina
   verticillata, the obligate pollinator wasp of F microcarpa. A Ficus
   species must exceed a critical population size (CPS) for its pollinator,
   a species of agaonid wasp, and other non-pollinator symbionts to
   colonize a new area and then maintain their new population. This CPS has
   often been estimated to be approximately 300 mature trees. The CPS for F
   microcarpa has been exceeded in Brisbane for some time. Brisbane has
   been colonized by the wasps Odontofroggatia galili (a gall species),
   since at least 1975, and E. verticillata, since at least 2004.
   Previously, the southern extreme of the range of E. verticillata was
   central Queensland, approximately 600 kin north of Brisbane. This was

Abstract = {{Insects are one of the most important groups in the natural world. They
   affect the life and welfare of humans in many different ways. While some
   insects are referred to as pests, others are beneficial to humans. For
   example, they may serve a function as pollinators of many cultivated
   plants, as natural enemies of harmful species, or as producers of
   valuable materials such as honey and silk. Several insect species,
   however, are not currently known as being harmful or beneficial.
   Nevertheless they are extremely important as essential components of
   both natural and modified ecosystems. In China, only 1\% of insect
   species described are major pests. The majority of insects are either
   neutral or beneficial to humans. China, with its vast territory, diverse
   climate and ecosystems, is amongst the richest countries in insect
   diversity. However, as a result of the economic and population growth
   and development, China's insect diversity is now faced with habitat
   degradation, species extinction, and a decline in the natural enemies of
   harmful pests. These problems are due to the expansion of agriculture,
   urbanization, industrialization, pollution, mining, tourism, introduced
   species, hunting, and the illegal trade in endangered species. In order
   to exploit the beneficial components of insects as biological resources
   and to effectively control their harmful aspects, many national
   strategies, legal actions and capacity-building activities have been
   developed and implemented. These efforts work towards the goal of insect
   diversity conservation in China.}},

Abstract = {{Ambrosia arrived in Hungary from northern Mediterranean in the 1920s,

   In Southern Hungary (northern part of Serbia-Montenegro included),
   Ambrosia pollen concentrations during the peak season are about one
   order of magnitude higher than the counts in the rest of Europe. The aim
   of the study is to survey the history of Ambrosia in the Carpathian
   Basin and analyse some Ambrosia pollen characteristics (season start,
   duration, average diurnal count and total count) focusing on a
   medium-sized city, Szeged, Southern Hungary. The data consists of daily
   Ambrosia pollen counts for the 15-year period between 1989 and 2003.
   Although Ambrosia pollen counts fluctuate considerably, no significant
   trends can be detected in their temporal course. According to the
   Makra-test, the highest pollen counts in Szeged are detected between 20
   August and 11 September. This period is in good correspondence with both

Abstract = {{The genus Sennu (K. Bahuin) Miller (Cassieae) is represented in
   Argentina by 35 species and several varieties distributed in temperate,
   tropical and subtropical regions, and presents a high degree of
   endemism. Some taxa are used for medicine, animal foraging and
   ornamental purposes. Floral morphology, phases, rewards, attractants,
   visitors, pollen, reproductive system, P/O ratio, OCl and ISI indexes of
   enantiostylous Senna corymbosa were analyzed for morphological
   androccial differentiation and possible related functional differences
   between stamens groups. The study was carried out over three consecutive
   flowering seasons in March of 1999, 2000 and 2001, in two populations
   near the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The species has a
   buzz-pollination syndrome. The pollinators are Bombus atratus that
   vibrate the stamens, leading to nothotribic or sternotribic deposition
   of pollen. P/O ratio and pollen production were high thanks to the
   precise pollinating mechanism that needs a large delivery of pollen to
   ensure effective pollen deposition. P/O ratio also indicates that the
   species is xenogamous, although geitonogamy and autogamy (only induced,
   not spontaneous) were also recorded. The species is self-compatible.
   There were differences in hand-pollination treatments between long and
   medium stamens in fruit set, as well as in vitro differential fertility
   between their pollen grains. Hence, there are morphological and
   functional androecium differences: the medium stamens play a nutritional
   role while the long ones play a reproductive one. These differences are
   reflected in the breeding system. Moreover, differential fertility and
   enantiostyly may diminish the effects of self-compatibility by partially
   reducing the contribution of geitonogamy to selfing.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although seasonal patterns of tree pollination have been
   reported, it is unknown if aerobiologic data correlate with patterns of
   in vivo sensitization.
   Objective: To evaluate the relationship between regional tree pollen
   exposure and patterns of in vivo percutaneous reactivity to specific
   tree pollen extracts in a local patient population with seasonal
   allergic rhinitis.
   Methods: Patients with spring seasonal allergic rhinitis and
   percutaneous sensitivity to 1 or more regional tree pollens were
   studied. Tree pollen counts were collected at the same urban site from
   1997 to 2002 and at a suburban site in 2002. Patients underwent skin
   prick testing with commercial extracts of 15 indigenous tree species.
   Serum specific IgE measurements were assayed in a subset of sensitized
   patients.
   Results: Of 127 patients who reported symptoms consistent with seasonal
   allergic rhinitis during the spring pollen season, 93 qualified based on
   demonstration of at least 1 positive skin prick test result. Mean 5-year
   pollen counts (1997-2001) and 2002 urban counts were highly correlated
   (Spearman r = 0.95, P <.001), indicating that year-to-year pollen counts
   were consistent. No significant correlation was found between mean
   seasonal pollen counts (urban site, 1997-2001) and frequencies of skin
   prick test reactivity to specific tree pollen allergens (Spearman r =
   -0.03, P =.93). No significant relationship was found between 5-year
   mean tree pollen counts and positive serum specific IgE tests for
   specific tree pollens (Spearman r = -0.42, P =.30). Eight of 15 species
   elicited percutaneous reactions in more than 50\% of patients (ie,
   satisfying definition of a major in vivo allergen). However, 6 of the 8
   major tree allergens each represented 5\% or less of 5-year mean total
   tree pollen counts.
   Conclusion: No correlation was found between overall frequencies of in
   vivo sensitization to tree pollen allergens in a local population and
   regional pollen exposure data.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{545-559}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A lack of food resources is often used as a reason for the decline in
   native birds in cities. This study investigated the use of exotic and
   native nectar resources by the nectarivore guild of birds, which often
   forms a major component of suburban bird communities in Australia. We
   investigated the food resource (nectar volume, concentration and sugar
   reward) of two common native and two exotic garden plant genera. We also
   determined the relative preference of the nectarivorous bird community
   for native and exotic plants and examined the relationship between
   nectarivore foraging preferences and particular garden characteristics.
   Banksias and grevilleas (native genera) produced significantly higher
   volumes of nectar than camellias and hibiscus (exotic genera) per floral
   unit, per plant and per cubic metre of foliage. Banksias also produced
   significantly more concentrated nectar and consequently a higher sugar
   reward per floral unit than the other three genera. Fourteen bird
   species were recorded using the study plants, although only three
   species were commonly observed feeding: the Red Wattlebird (Anthochaera
   carunculata), Little Wattlebird (Anthochaera chrysoptera) and Noisy
   Miner (Manorina melanocephala). Banksia and grevillea plants were
   preferred by all bird species, which spent significantly more time in
   banksia than in any other genus. Other variables influencing the time
   birds spent in a plant were the number of floral units per plant and the
   number of banksia and callistemon plants present in the garden. Overall,
   the native genera, banksia and grevillea were not only a more valuable
   source of food than the exotic genera, camellia and hibiscus, but they
   were also the preferred foraging sites for suburban nectarivorous birds.
   Whether the surplus of nectar from native shrubs is associated with
   territories of larger and aggressive honeyeaters competitively excluding
   small birds from gardens, is an important research agenda for
   understanding these urban bird communities. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Eucalyptus morrisbyi is an endangered eucalypt, restricted to four
   populations on the island of Tasmania. The two main populations are
   separated by 20 km, occurring in the Risdon Hills and on Calverts Hill,
   and differ markedly in size and health. Although they are both in
   reserves, the small population at Risdon Hills has experienced a marked
   decline in the last two decades. The other two populations (Lumeah Point
   and Honeywood Drive) are very small and under threat because of
   urbanisation. They are close to the large Calverts Hill population and
   may be remnants of a once larger population in this area prior to
   clearing for agriculture in the 19th century. A hypervariable
   chloroplast marker and six nuclear microsatellites, used to quantify
   genetic diversity among and within populations, indicated marked genetic
   differences between the two main populations ( Risdon and Calverts
   Hills), with virtually no sharing of chloroplast haplotypes and little
   sharing of microsatellite alleles among populations. Both of the main
   populations are clearly required to adequately conserve the genetic
   diversity in this species, whereas the Lumeah Point and Honeywood Drive
   populations are similar to the proximal Calverts Hill population. The
   two main populations showed equally high levels of genetic diversity
   (average H(E) = 0.69) in the adult trees, using microsatellites, and
   little difference in inbreeding levels despite the large difference in
   population size. Analyses of 366 offspring from 9-11 trees from each
   main population revealed high outcrossing rates, little biparental
   inbreeding and high genetic diversity (average H(E) = 0.65) in both
   seedling populations. This indicates that open-pollinated seed
   collections from these populations capture sufficient genetic diversity
   for ex situ conservation plantings. It is argued that the high genetic
   diversity maintained in the small Risdon Hills population is due to a
   combination of the longevity of its genotypes (possibly up to 1155-1523
   years) through a well developed mechanism of vegetative regeneration
   from lignotubers, coupled with high outcrossing rates maintained by a
   strong self-incompatibility mechanism.}},

Title = {{Does the introduced bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (Apidae), prefer
   flowers of introduced or native plants in Australia?}},

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Proponents of importation of the European bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (
   L.), into Australia for pollination of commercial greenhouse crops argue
   that this species will have little impact on Australian native
   ecosystems because it prefers to forage on flowers of introduced species
   of plants rather than Australian native plants. However, data presented
   as evidence of preference for introduced plants have been equivocal.
   This study compared the attractiveness of introduced and Australian
   native plants to free- foraging B. terrestris in a garden at the
   interface between an urban area and native vegetation in the Australian
   island of Tasmania, where a feral population of B. terrestris had been
   established for over 10 years. No evidence was found to support the
   proposal that B. terrestris forages on flowers of introduced plants in
   preference to those of Australian native plants. The numbers of B.
   terrestris seen foraging per 1000 flowers did not differ significantly
   between introduced plants and Australian native plants, and the
   preferred food sources of B. terrestris included flowers of both
   introduced and Australian native species. Because B. terrestris forages
   frequently on many species of both introduced and native plants,
   assessments of its ecological impacts must include the effects of
   altered pollination on recruitment rates in both introduced weeds and
   native plants, and reduced quantities of nectar and pollen of native
   plants on recruitment rates of dependent fauna.}},

Abstract = {{In the Jaboque wetland, located within Bogota's urban perimeter, we
   studied the taxonomic and trophic composition, the richness and the
   diversity of arthropod fauna associated with five plant communities
   dominated by: Juncus effusus, Juncus effusus-Polygonum punctatum,
   Schoenoplectus californicus, Typha latifolia and Bidens laevis. These
   vegetation communities are important because their great coverage within
   the wetland and their successful establishment under low perturbation
   conditions. 212 morphospecies were identified distributed in 48 families
   and seven orders. This richness qualifies the high andean wetlands,
   submitted to low perturbations conditions as centers of high
   concentration of arthropods species. Along the study 8944 individuals
   were collected representing a dry biomass of 9757.8mg. The order Diptera
   and its families Ephydridae, Chironomidae and Muscidae outstand by its
   predominance in richness, abundance and biomass level. Within the
   vegetation communities considered we appreciate a variable arthropod
   fauna in composition, high diversity of morphospecies and complex
   trophic diversity. There were also found six types of distribution
   patterns. Arthropod fauna elements were identified (16 morphospecies)
   that possibly have reproduction inference to some plants of the wetland,
   because of its floral visitor behaviour. Plants of the Asteraceae
   family, with an entomophilous pollination estrategy and the Poaceae
   family with an anemophilous strategy presented the highest concentration
   of anthophilous insects.}},

Abstract = {{The production of watermelon in soilless culture is increasing in
   importance as a complement of the grafting technique to control
   phytopathological problems. The influence of this crop production system
   in fruit quality, particularly in sugar accumulation patterns, have not
   been studied yet comparing different substrates and the production in
   soil. On the other hand, the use of the synthetic cytokinin CPPU as an
   alternative or complementary method to fruit setting in watermelon
   production is also increasing in importance and its influence on fruit
   quality are not well clarified. In the present experiment two setting
   procedures (CPPU sprayed to the pistilate flowers and hand pollination
   with male flowers of the diploid cultivar `Dulce Maravilla') were
   compared in three growing media (perlite, coir dust and rockwool) in
   watermelon plants of the triploid cultivar `Reina de Corazones' grafted
   onto `Shintoza'. Plants were grown in a greenhouse from April to July.
   Yields, fruit weight, Hunter colour parameters and soluble sugars
   accumulation were determined by sampling fruits at 20, 25, 30, 35, 40
   and 45 days after fruit setting. The substrate or fruit setting
   procedure did not influence yields. Fruit weight was significantly
   higher in plants grown in rockwool than in the other substrates and was
   not affected either by the fruit setting procedure. No interactions
   between both factors under study were found in any of the quality
   parameters analyzed. Sugar accumulation patterns and contents were
   similar to those found in other studies. CPPU delayed the internal
   redness colour and sugar accumulation, particularly of sucrose, but was
   dependent on substrates. The internal redness colour was faster in
   fruits grown in perlite. Little influence of the substrate was found in
   the fructose or glucose accumulation patterns but sucrose and total
   soluble solids were higher in fruits from plants cultivated in perlite.
   Since sugar accumulation in watermelon is affected by water
   availability, these results seem to be related to differences in the
   available water holding capacity of the substrates.}},

Title = {{Africanized honeybees: Biological characteristics, urban nesting
   behavior and accidents caused in Brazilian cities (Hymenoptera : Apidae)}},
Journal = {{SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{535-550}},
Abstract = {{In 1956 African honeybee queens (Apis mellifera scutellata) were
   imported from South Africa and Tanzania to Brazil, as part of a
   government project to increase Brazilian honey production. The European
   honeybees existing in that country had not adapted well to the tropical
   conditions and consequently, had a low productivity. The newly
   introduced bee was known to produce substantially more honey than the
   other subspecies, but was also famous for its great aggressiveness and
   quicker attack of intruders with less disturbance. Hoping to create a
   new hybrid bee that would be both docile and productive, the scientist
   Warwick Estevam Kerr tried to cross the African and the European
   subspecies under controlled conditions. However, an accident resulted in
   the escape of 26 swarms into the Brazilian countryside, where their
   queens mated with drones of the European resident honeybees. The
   poly-hybrid bees resulting from these crossings expressed
   scutellata-like reproductive, foraging, and defensive behaviors and, for
   this reason, were called Africanized honeybees. They spread rapidly from
   the introduction area of the African honeybees (near Rio Claro, Sao
   Paulo state) to as far south as mid-Argentina and to the north of Texas,
   also settling in Arizona, New Mexico, California and Nevada, due to
   their high adaptability to variable ecological conditions. In spite of a
   few undesirable behaviors, these bees have been invoking larger economic
   interest because they produce much more honey, have good resistance to
   diseases and are excellent pollinators. In Brazil, because people
   frequently disturb the environment, the occupation of urban refuges by
   Africanized honeybees has been increasing in the last years. The concern
   with accidents is generally associated with the high swarming frequency
   recorded during the year and the variety of shelters available in urban
   areas. This paper deals with the biological characteristics of the
   Africanized honeybees, their nesting behavior in urban environments, and
   accidents caused by these bees in Brazilian cities.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence of repellent properties in catnip, Nepeta cataria L., to flies
   and cockroaches was observed in preliminary studies. This study compared
   catnip essential oil from steam distillation and elemol, a major
   constituent of osage orange essential oil, to current commercial
   repellents. These comparative studies found both the catnip steam
   distillate and elemol to be as good, and in some cases better, at
   repelling house flies, Musca domestica L., and American cockroaches,
   Periplaneta americana L., than N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) or
   citronellal. Both short-term and long-term repellency bioassays were
   used to assess repellency. Catnip essential oil showed greater
   repellency than DEET and citronellal in the short term. Extended
   repellency bioassays showed elemol to be more repellent than catnip
   steam distillate, citronellal, and DEET. Nepetalactone, the major
   constituent of catnip essential oil, is present as two isomers, and
   previous studies have shown the E,Z-nepetalactone
   {[}2-(2-hydroxy-1-methylethenyl)-5-methyl-cyclopentancearboxylic acid
   delta lactone] isomer to be even more repellent to cockroaches than the
   dominant isomer, Z,E-nepetalactone. This study examined the seasonal
   variation of the two isomers, Z,E- and E,Z-nepetalactone, in catnip.
   Samples of fresh catnip mature leaves, immature leaves, and stems were
   steam-distilled separately, and isomer composition was analyzed using
   high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography (GC). An
   analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant differences by week. The
   mature leaf essential oil samples were tested in a repellency bioassay
   and exhibited significant repellency to German cockroaches, Blattella
   germanica L. The catnip floral volatiles were sampled using solid phase
   microextraction, and analysis with GC/mass spectrometry showed the
   presence of Z,E-nepetalactone, E,Z-nepetalactone, and beta-caryophyllene
   as the major constituents. Phytophagous insects and potential
   pollinators present on sampling dates were recorded.}},

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean coast of Lebanon is being destroyed by urban expansion

   Pancratium maritimum L. (Amaryllidaceae), to contribute to knowledge of
   these highly threatened habitats and investigate possible strategies for
   their conservation. Ecogeographic surveys, population dynamics and
   molecular analysis were undertaken. Individual populations occupied
   areas ranging from 704 and 32,000 m(2) and differed in their structure
   and reproductive ability. Clump density ranged between 0.002 to 5.6
   Clumps m(-2). Percent fecundity varied significantly between populations
   and ranged between 0.07 and 57.4\%. In contrast, seedling recruitment
   and survival were consistently nil or low in all populations. The
   average Nei's unbiased genetic identity based on RAPD data was 0.09,
   suggesting that the species is self-pollinated. Cluster analysis
   indicated that populations did not group according to geographic
   proximity. F statistics revealed higher variation within than between

   the current status of P. maritimum in Lebanon is Vulnerable {[}VU B I ab

Abstract = {{Plants with highly specialized pollination systems may be particularly
   vulnerable to the effects of habitat fragmentation. The subcanopy tree
   Oxyanthus pyriformis subsp. pyriformis has deep tubular flowers (c. 90
   mm in length) that are specialized for pollination by long-tongued
   hawkmoths. Existing natural populations of this taxon appear to be
   confined to two suburban habitat fragments in the city of Durban, South
   Africa. Breeding system experiments showed that the trees are
   self-incompatible and thus completely reliant on pollen vectors for
   sexual reproduction. Hawkmoths were rarely observed to visit flowers,
   despite intensive monitoring over four seasons from 1997 to 2003. Fruit
   set as determined from examination of more than 150,000 flowers at the
   two sites was extremely low (0.04\% and 0.07\% of flowers), but
   increased to more than 70\% in flowers that were)hand-pollinated with
   pollen from another tree. This >1000-fold increase in the likelihood of
   fruit production following pollen-supplementation indicates that trees
   experience severe pollen-limitation of fruit set. Natural fruit set is
   so low that only a few dozen fruits were recorded in each population
   during two years of monitoring. This is of concern as O. pyriformis
   trees are dependent solely on seeds for recruitment. Demographic surveys
   showed that remaining natural populations have fewer saplings than adult
   trees and only two seedlings for every adult tree. The long-term
   viability of reintroduced populations of O. pyriformis is also in doubt,
   as we observed an almost complete lack of recruitment in a population
   that was established in a seemingly suitable forest site 20 years ago.
   Regular hand-pollination and, in some instances, further planting of
   saplings, may be the only way to safeguard these populations. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{We assessed bee diversity and abundance in urban areas of Vancouver,
   British Columbia, Canada, to determine how urban environments can
   support bees. Habitats examined were community and botanical gardens,
   urban wild areas, Naturescape flower beds and backyards, and traditional
   flower beds and backyards. A total of 56 bee species (Hymenoptera),
   including species of the genera Andrena Fabr. (Andrenidae), Bombus Latr.
   (Apidae), Osmia Panzer and Megachile Latr. (Megachilidae), and Halictus
   Latr. and Dialictus Pauly (Halictidae), were collected. Abundance
   exhibited strong seasonal variation. Wild bees were most abundant during
   late spring, whereas honey bees peaked at the end of the summer. The
   most abundant species seen was the managed honey bee Apis mellifera L.
   (Apidae), followed by wild Bombus flavifrons Cresson. Community and
   botanical gardens, and plants such as cotoneaster (Cotoneaster Medik.
   sp.) and blackberry (Rubus discolor Weihe \& Nees) (Rosaceae), centaurea
   (Centaurea L. sp.; Asteraceae), buttercup (Ranunculus L. sp.;
   Ranunculaceae), and foxglove (Digitalis L. sp.; Scrophulariaceae), had
   the highest abundance of bees, while bee populations in wild areas were
   the most diverse. Weeds such as dandelions (Taraxacum officinale G.H.
   Weber ex Wiggers; Asteraceae) dominated these wild areas and had one of
   the highest diversities of bee visitors. Traditional flower beds with
   tulips (Tulipa L. sp.; Liliaceae) and petunias (Petunia Juss. sp.;
   Solanaceae) had relatively poor diversity and abundance of bees
   throughout the year. Our study suggests that urban areas have the
   potential to be important pollinator reservoirs, especially if both
   bloom and habitat heterogeneity are maintained and enhanced through
   sustainable urban planning.}},

   Grafting the scion onto `Shintoza' (Cucurbita maxima X Cucurbita

   synthetic cytokinin CPPU {[}1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3-phenylurea]
   retarded the accumulation of sugar and development of the flesh colour
   of the fruit, compared to fruit from non-grafted, pollinated plants. The
   effects of grafting and of CPPU application on sugar accumulation were
   additive. At commercial maturity, the fruit of grafted and/or
   CPPU-treated plants had lower total soluble solids and sugar
   concentrations, and lower sucrose to hexose ratios, than fruit from
   control plants. Fruit from CPPU-treated plants also had a weaker red
   colour than fruit set by pollination. Despite this loss of quality,
   fruit from grafted plants, set with CPPU and grown in a heated

   from pollinated, non-grafted plants, grown outdoors.}},

Abstract = {{Bud pollination in seven self-incompatible Citrus cultivars was carried
   out to produce self-fertilized seedlings with genotypes homozygous for
   the self-incompatibility gene. Flower buds of the seven
   self-incompatible Citrus cultivars, `Banpeiyu' (C. grandis), `Hirado
   Buntan' (C. grandis), `Hassaku' (C. hassaku), `Shishiyuzu' (C.
   pseudogulgul), `Clementine' (C. clementina), `Tosa Buntan' (C.
   otachibana) and `Hyuganatsu' (C. tamurana), were emasculated at various
   stages of flower bud development, and self-pollinated with their fresh
   pollen from flower buds collected just before anthesis. Seeded fruits
   were obtained from flower buds of 6-8 mm length for `Clementine', 7-11
   mm for `Hyuganatsu', 11-15 mm for `Shishiyuzu', 6-14 mm for `Hassaku',
   12-19 mm for `Hirado Buntan' and 12-22 mm, for `Banpeiyu'. The optimum
   length of flower buds for self-fertilized seed production was 6-8 mm for
   `Clementine', 8-12 mm for `Hassaku', 9-13 mm for `Hyuganatsu', 11-14 mm
   for `Shishiyuzu', 12-17 mm for `Hirado' and 14-19 mm for `Banpeiyu'.
   Flower buds producing the largest number of perfect seeds in each
   self-pollination were about half the length of those just before
   anthesis. At or just after this stage of flower bud development,
   stigmatic exudate production occurred. The largest number of perfect
   seeds in self-pollinated fruits was almost the same as the average
   number of perfect seeds in open- or cross-pollinated fruits in six
   cultivars except for `Shishiyuzu' in which self-pollinated fruits
   contained a few seeds. These results suggested that half-sized flower
   buds in their development were the most optimum stage for the production
   of self-fertilized seeds by bud pollination in self-incompatible Citrus
   cultivars, and that self-in compatibility reaction increased after this
   stage. It was also suggested that in `Shishiyuzu' the
   self-incompatibility reaction is different from that in the other six
   Citrus cultivars. No difference was found in size between
   self-fertilized and cross-fertilized seeds. The self-fertilized seeds
   germinated and grew normally without any inbreeding depression.}},

Abstract = {{About 30\% of the Hungarian population has some type of allergy, 65\% of
   them have pollen sensitivity, and at least 60\% of this pollen
   sensitivity is caused by ragweed. The short (or common) ragweed
   (Ambrosia artemisiifolia = Ambrosia elatior) has the most aggressive
   pollen of all. Clinical investigations prove that its allergenic pollen
   is the main reason for the most massive, most serious and most
   long-lasting pollinosis. The air in the Carpathian Basin is the most
   polluted with ragweed pollen in Europe. The aim of the study is to
   analyse how ragweed pollen concentration is influenced by meteorological
   elements in a medium-sized city, Szeged, Southern Hungary. The data
   basis consists of daily ragweed pollen counts and averages of 11
   meteorological parameters for the 5-year daily data set, between 1997
   and 2001. The study considers some of the ragweed pollen characteristics
   for Szeged. Application of the Makra test indicates the same period for
   the highest pollen concentration as that established by the main
   pollination period. After performing factor analysis for the daily
   ragweed pollen counts and the 11 meteorological variables examined, four
   factors were retained that explain 84.4\% of the total variance of the
   original 12 variables. Assessment of the daily pollen number was
   performed by multiple regression analysis and results based on
   deseasonalised and original data were compared.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of streptomycin (SM) spraying on seed production in open
   pollinated fruit and effects of thinning time and trunk girdling on the
   set, development and fruit quality were investigated to develop a
   practical technique for producing seedless `Tosa Buntan' pummelo. Three
   spray application of 500 ppm SM to whole trees at 1-5\%, 50\% and 100\%
   full bloom significantly decreased the number of perfect seeds to 4.5
   seeds per fruit. Fruit thinning with leaf/fruit ratio of 90-100 in June
   24 (6 weeks after full bloom) promoted the development of open
   pollinated fruit, yielding mature fruit weighing about 470 g with 5.7
   seeds and the soluble solid and citric acid contents statistically the
   same as those of the hand pollinated control fruits. Trunk girdling on
   May 1 was ineffective. The combination of three, 500 ppm SM treatments
   and fruit thinning on June 24, yielded fruit averaging 464 g with 5.7
   seeds. Our analysis of the relationship fruit size in June 24 to seed
   number and fruit size in harvest time, indicate that fruit weighing
   450-530 g with about 4 seeds was possibly produced by keeping fruits
   large as 42-48 mm in diam. when thinning is done about June 24. Our
   results demonstrate that commercial production of near seedless `Tosa
   Buntan' pummelo fruit is possible by 1) three spray treatments with 500
   ppm SM at 1-5, 50 and 100\% full bloom, 2) fruit thinning in late June,
   3) retaining only fruits large as 42-48 mm in diam. and 4) maintaining a

Abstract = {{The control of rhythmic emission of floral volatiles emitted from Rosa
   damascena semperflorens cv. `Quatre Saisons' throughout floral
   development under various light regimes was studied. 2-Phenylethanol was
   the major volatile emitted in addition to monoterpenols, oxidised
   monoterpenols, monoterpenes and aromatic compounds. All detected
   volatiles were emitted rhythmically, with maximum peaks coinciding 8-10
   h into a 12-h photoperiod. For some compounds a secondary, nocturnal
   peak was apparent. The primary and secondary maxima both occurred at
   approximately 24-h intervals. Rhythms appeared to be regulated
   endogenously: rhythmic emission continued upon exposure to continuous
   light or continuous darkness, and a phase shift in emission was induced
   upon inversion of the photoperiod. Additionally, emission continued
   after flower excision. A similar profile of free volatiles was stored
   within the floral tissue, together with glycosidic forms of
   2-phenylethanol (>99\% beta-D-glucoside), benzyl alcohol, citronellol
   and geraniol. Regression analysis indicated a significant decrease in
   glycosylated 2-phenylethanol through the photoperiod. These results
   suggest that glycosylated volatiles stored within petals may be a source

Abstract = {{With regards to pollination there exist several mutualistic
   relationships between Hadena-species and Caryophyllaceae. As mutualists
   have both negative and positive effects on their partners, mutualism is
   often betoken as reciprocative exploitation which may shift to
   parasitism if the exploitation of one partner becomes prevalent.
   Several Silene- and Saponaria-species are considered to be larval host
   plants of Hadena bicruris. Although Silene latifolia ssp. alba and S.
   dioica are frequently cited as hosts of the seed eating larvae, field
   and laboratory observations at Ulm were suggestive for only S. latifolia
   ssp. alba being a suitable host. Records of the oviposition behavior of
   H. bicruris made it evident that in fact a considerable number of eggs
   could be found in planted stands of both species. On the other hand,
   phenological data of the flowering periods and of the oviposition
   behavior of H. bicruris showed that S. latifolia ssp. alba is clearly
   preferred for oviposition if host selection is possible due to
   contemporaneous flowering of individuals of both plant species growing
   at close range. In addition, the flowering periods of S. latifolia ssp.
   alba and the periods of moth activity overlap to a large extent. This is
   not the case in S. dioica. Feeding experiences first indicated that the
   caterpillars may not prefer one of the species to the other, but
   comparison of the pupal weight of the animals reared on fruits of
   exclusively one of the species showed that the seeds of S. latifolia
   ssp. alba were more profitable for nutrition than those of S. dioica;
   the pupal weight of animals reared on seeds of the former species
   significantly exceeded that of animals reared on seeds of the latter
   one. The question arises if the symbiosis of H. bicruris and its hosts
   constitutes a stable situation or if an evolutionary shift to mutualism
   or parasitism will take place.}},

Abstract = {{Archontophoenix palms, utilized both as ornamental species and as a
   source of high-quality heart of palm, are susceptible to sooty mold, a
   disease coupled with aphid infestation, which affects photosynthesis and
   causes unpleasant, darkish palm appearance. Scoring rates for sooty mold
   resistance and three growth traits were assessed under field conditions
   in 24 open-pollinated half-sibs families, 28 months after planting,
   aiming to identify genetic variability for sooty mold resistance;
   estimate genetic parameters for this trait and plant height, diameter
   and number of leaves; estimate genetic and phenotypic correlation for
   the four traits and evaluate selection methods for heart of palm
   production through multi-trait index selection based on growth traits.
   There were genetic differences among families for all traits. The low
   coefficient of variation for sooty mold (9.48\%) indicates that the
   visual rating method adopted was effective and feasible for comparing
   aphid plus sooty mold infestation levels in Archontophoenix. Narrow
   sense heritability estimates were low and medium for growth traits
   (0.10, 0.26 and 0.26 for leaves number, plant diameter and height,
   respectively) and very high (0.91) for sooty mold resistance. Genetic
   correlation was found between sooty mold resistance and plant height.
   This positive relationship indicates that culling of very susceptible
   palms can be done possibily without interference in the follow up
   indirect selection for heart of palm yield. Some selection strategies
   were presented, showing that possible genetic gain could range from 6.23
   to 11.83\%, depending on the selection method adopted and on the
   effective restriction of the population size.}},

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{592-602}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Several studies have reported markers linked to a putative resistance
   gene from Poncirus trifoliata (Ctv-R) located at linkage group 4 that
   confers resistance against one of the most important citrus pathogens,
   citrus tristeza virus (CTV). To be successful in both marker-assisted
   selection and transformation experiments, its accurate mapping is
   needed. Several factors may affect its localization, among them two are
   considered here: the definition of resistance and the genetic background
   of progeny.
   Two progenies derived from P. trifoliata, by self-pollination and by
   crossing with sour orange (Citrus aurantium), a citrus rootstock
   well-adapted to arid and semi-arid areas, were used for linkage group-4
   marker enrichment. Two new methodologies were used to enrich this region
   with expressed sequences. The enrichment of group 4 resulted in the
   fusion of several C. aurantium linkage groups. The new one A(7+3+4) is
   now saturated with 48 markers including expressed sequences.
   Surprisingly, sour orange was as resistant to the CTV isolate tested as
   was P. trifoliata, and three hybrids that carry Ctv-R, as deduced from
   its flanking markers, are susceptible to CTV. The new linkage maps were
   used to map Ctv-R under the hypothesis of monogenic inheritance. Its
   position on linkage group 4 of P. trifoliata differs from the location
   previously reported in other progenies. The genetic analysis of
   virus-plant interaction in the family derived from C. aurantium after a
   CTV chronic infection showed the segregation of five types of
   interaction, which is not compatible with the hypothesis of a single
   gene controlling resistance. Two major issues are discussed: another
   type of genetic analysis of CTV resistance is needed to avoid the
   assumption of monogenic inheritance, and transferring Ctv-R from P.
   trifoliata to sour orange might not avoid the CTV decline of sweet
   orange trees.}},

Abstract = {{Alnus pollen is an early component of the annual atmospheric aerosol of
   the north-west regions of Spain, which causes the first occurrence of
   allergic symptoms. Seasonal and intra-daily variation of Alnus
   pollination, and the influence that main meteorological parameters
   exert, was studied in this paper. Monitoring was carried out from
   1993-2002, by using two Lanzoni VPPS 2000 volumetric samplers. Once the
   atmospheric behaviour of this pollen had been identified, the final
   objective was to elaborate predictive models to determine the onset of
   the Alnus pollen season and its concentrations during the pollination
   period in two localities of north-west Spain (Santiago and Ourense).
   Winter chilling required to overcome the bud-dormancy period was similar
   in both cities, with around 800 Chilling Hours (C.H.) and 5.5degreesC
   threshold temperature. Calculation of heat requirement for bud growth
   was carried out with maximum temperature, with around 50 Growth Degree
   Days (G.D.D.degreesC) needed, with VC threshold temperature. Data from
   2002 were used in order to determine the real validity of the models,
   This year was not taken into account to establish the aforementioned
   models. The variation between the predicted start of the pollen season
   and the observed season was smallest in Ourense. Verifying the proposed
   models for predicting daily mean concentrations of Alnus pollen during
   the pollen season shows that the predicted curves fits the observed
   variations of daily mean concentrations.}},

   globe-shaped similar to an orange, easy to peel, ripens in September and
   attains an orange coloring. It is as productive as `Maribel'; the
   tangor. `Valentina' has fruits of excellent quality, midseason ripening
   and is less productive than the former. The 16/73 selection is also
   productive, its fruits are oblique, smooth skinned and the color is pale
   yellowish. It is difficult to peel. The 16/10 selection produces
   large-sized tangerines with tender skinned segments, palatable and not
   very intense but brilliant orange color that gives it good eye appeal.
   The selections 16/49 and 17/6 were less promising.}},

   and another some weeks later when crop load is reduced as excess
   fruitlets are shed. Climatic conditions (cool temperatures or water

   bud induction process, whereas climatic stress and internal limitations
   from lack of pollination, adverse hormonal levels or competition for

Abstract = {{The subtropical horticultural sector in Australia has undergone profound
   change in the last 20 years and there is now a strong emphasis on
   quality of produce. Pollination is an important influence on quality in
   subtropical fruit and nut crops and pollination with different pollen
   genotypes is known to influence quality variables such as sugar content,
   fruit size and seediness. The effect of two cross pollen genotypes,
   `Murcott' tangor and `Imperial' mandarin, and the effect of self pollen,
   bagging and no pollination on `Oroval Clementine' mandarin in Bundaberg,
   Australia were tested. `Oroval Clementine' fruit set was reduced in the
   self, bagged and unpollinated treatments (P<0.01). These treatments
   produced 0 to 5\% fruit set, less than one third of the fruit set for
   cross-pollinated treatments (15\%). There was no significant difference
   between the cross-pollinated treatments. Fruit weights were also
   significantly affected by pollination (P<0.01). `Oroval Clementine'
   fruit from cross pollen treatments weighed 1.5 times more than fruits of
   the unpollinated treatments. However, the cross-pollinated fruits were
   very seedy and contained 15 to 20 seeds per fruit. These results show
   that `Oroval Clementine'may have very low parthenocarpic fruit set under
   Australian conditions. Higher fruit set and larger, more seedy fruits
   are likely to be obtained by interplanting `Oroval Clementine' with
   `Imperial' mandarin and `Murcott' tangor.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common allergic problem
   in Kuwait. Most of the patients who have either AR or asthma are
   referred to the Al-Rashed Allergy Center. Objective: To determine if
   there is a seasonal variation in AR in Kuwait and to correlate it with
   the daily pollen count. Methods: Information about the new patients
   referred to the center over a 5-year study period (1996-2000) was
   extracted from the center's records. The daily pollen count in Kuwait
   city was obtained from the Air Biology Laboratory. Results: There was a
   significant seasonal variation with a bimodal increase in the number of
   patients with AR referred to the center. The main peak in the number of
   patients occurred in September October, and there was a smaller peak in
   April-May. The mean number +/-SD of new patients per month over the
   5-year period varied from 87 +/- 32 for December to 367 +/- 104 for
   September. Similarly, the average daily pollen count varied from 3.7 +/-
   1.0 pollens per mm(3) in January to 124 +/- 92 in October. There was
   high correlation between the number of new AR patients and the average
   total pollen count (Pearson correlation, r = 0.77, p ! 0.001), as well
   as with Chenopodiaceae and Amaranthaceae (weed) pollens (r = 0.75, p <
   0.001), while there was no correlation between the number of new
   patients and either tree or grass pollens. Conclusion: Seasonal AR
   occurs during two periods in Kuwait, i.e. September October and
   April-May, with September-October being the main season. The rise in AR
   during late summer in Kuwait is mainly associated with the pollination
   of Chenopodiaceae species. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.}},

Abstract = {{The origin and evolution of the Japanese nocturnal Hemerocallis citrina
   var. vespertina (Asparagales: Hemerocallidaceae) were studied. Flower
   longevity and 13 external morphological characters were measured and
   compared with a molecular phylogenetic tree obtained from the nucleotide
   sequences of three noncoding chloroplast regions, the rbcL-atpB
   intergenic region, the trnL (UAA) intron, and the spacer region between
   trnL (UAA) 3' exon and trnF (GAA). We found evolutionary changes not
   only in qualitative traits but also in quantitative traits. Results from
   the molecular phylogenetic analyses showed that H. citrina var.
   vespertina did not form a monophyletic group; that clades in the
   molecular tree contained both species, indicating that Japanese H.
   citrina var. vespertina had multiple origins and originated from at
   least three different lineages that invaded the Japanese Archipelagoes
   separately through different routes; and that evolutionary adaptation
   for flower longevity occurred in parallel. Based on morphological,
   phenological, and molecular analyses, we suggest that
   pollinator-mediated evolutionary changes in floral characters were
   accompanied by adaptive evolution for flower longevity.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of adapted, high-quality, easy-to-peel, seedless
   mandarin/mandarin hybrid cultivars is paramount for the future success
   of the Florida tangerine industry. The primary approach of the CREC
   cultivar improvement team to achieve this objective is to develop
   superior triploid cultivars, which should be seedless regardless of
   cross pollination. At present, the most efficient method for producing
   large populations of genetically diverse triploids for selection is via
   interploid crosses of monoembryonic diploid females with tetraploid
   pollen parents. A broad germplasm base will facilitate the
   identification of superior interploid parental combinations. We have
   been using somatic hybridization to expand our base of superior
   tetraploid breeding parents, and in this report we introduce 12 new
   hybrids produced from parents selected for fruit quality,
   cold-hardiness, and late maturity as follows: `Murcott' tangor +
   `Sunburst' tangerine; `Murcott' + {[}'Clementine' x `Satsuma' hybrid];
   `Murcott' + `Washington' navel orange; `Murcott' + `Osceola' mandarin

Abstract = {{The origins of modern fruit culture occurred in the Fertile Crescent in
   the late Neolithic and Bronze Age (6000 to 3000 BCE) with date palm,
   olive, grape, almond, fig and pomegranate. Central Asian temperate
   fruits including pome fruits (apple, pear, quince and medlar) and stone
   fruits (almond, apricot, cherry, peach, and plum) were fully
   domesticated by antiquity. Citrus fruits were domesticated early in
   China but reached the West in waves starting with citron. A number of
   popular fruits (strawberry, blueberry, cranberry, and kiwifruit) were
   only domesticated in the 18(th), 19(th), and 20(th) centuries while many
   fruits, although extensively collected and marketed, remain to be
   domesticated (lingonberry, various cacti and durian). Domestication of
   fruit crops resulted from vegetative propagation of elite natural
   variants with further improvement from selection of natural recombinants
   produced by natural intercrosses involving improved types. Cultural
   practices often unique to each crop, such as irrigation, pollination
   control, grafting, rootstocks, pruning and training, storage, and
   processing, were developed to increase productivity, improve quality and
   extend use. Genetic variants that were selected included breakdown of
   dioecy, improvement of fruit size, increased sugars or oil, ease of
   vegetative propagation, seedlessness, parthenocarpy, loss of thorns,
   breakdown of self-incompatibility, pest resistance, and increased
   productivity, quality, storage and shelf life. Factors contributing to
   improvement include mutation, interspecific recombination,
   polyploidization through unreduced gametes, and selection involving
   generations of sexual recombination. However, not until the beginning of
   the 19(th) century was selection purposely imposed through cycles of
   seed propagation (Jean Baptiste Van Mons, 1765-1842, in pear) nor
   hybridization pursued (Thomas Andrew Knight, 1759-1838, in apple and
   pear, redcurrant and strawberry, and cherry, nectarine, and plum).
   Current progress has been achieved through intensification of the same
   forces that have occurred naturally with emphasis on increased
   adaptability through hardiness, chill requirements, photoperiod
   insensitivity and resistance to biotic stress. Because many of our
   fruits are essentially little changed from wild types, continued
   progress should be possible. Molecular techniques hold out the promise
   of increasing the efficiency of selection through molecular markers and
   insertion of individual genes through transgene technology.}},

Abstract = {{Seedlessness is an important trait in citrus cultivars for the fresh
   fruit market. It can be obtained by selection of self-incompatibility
   and sterility genes or by triploid methodology. Auto-incompatibility
   phenomena induce sterility but cross pollinations restore fertility.
   INRA and CIRAD-FLHOR are exploring triploid methodology to create new
   hybrids for diversification of the easy peeler citrus group. One of the
   possibilities is to select for spontaneous triploids occurring naturally
   in citrus progenies. These result from gametic cell fusions between a
   haploid gamete and an unreduced diploid gamete. We crossed three
   selections of clementine and a mandarin with different citrus species.
   Considering that the unbalanced level of ploidy between endosperm cells
   and embryo cells could affect seed development, we screened seeds, and
   extracted embryos which were then cultivated in vitro. From 99 triploid
   hybrids, we saved 88 by macro-grafting. We determined the parental
   origin of diplogamy for 72 triploid hybrids using isozymes. We have
   found that 2n ovum production (diplogyny) is very frequent, and 2n
   pollen production (diploandry) is a rare event (less than 2\%). A few
   triploid hybrids have started to fruit. Comparison of seed yield per
   fruit for triploid hybrids and their genitors showed a dramatic decrease
   of female fertility leading most of the time to total sterility. Pollen
   of triploid hybrids was totally sterile.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses social-ecological dynamics in the greater
   metropolitan area of Stockholm County, Sweden, with special focus on the
   National Urban Park (NUP). It is part of the Millennium Ecosystem
   Assessment (MA) and has the following specific objectives: (1) to
   provide scientific information on biodiversity patterns, ecosystem
   dynamics, and ecosystem services generated; (2) to map interplay between
   actors and institutions involved in management of ecosystem services;
   and (3) to identify strategies for strengthening social-ecological
   resilience. The green areas in Stockholm County deliver numerous
   ecosystem services, for example, air filtration, regulation of
   microclimate, noise reduction, surface water drainage, recreational and
   cultural values, nutrient retention, and pollination and seed dispersal.
   Recreation is among the most important services and NUP, for example,
   has more than 15 million visitors per year. More than 65 organizations
   representing 175,000 members are involved in management of ecosystem
   services. However, because of population increase and urban growth
   during the last three decades, the region displays a quite dramatic loss
   of green areas and biodiversity. An important future focus is how
   management may reduce increasing isolation of urban green areas and
   enhance connectivity. Comanagement should be considered where locally
   managed green space may function as buffer zones and for management of
   weak links that connect larger green areas; for example, there are three
   such areas around NUP identified. Preliminary results indicate that
   areas of informal management represent centers on which to base adaptive
   comanagement, with the potential to strengthen biodiversity management
   and resilience in the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Traps baited with synthetic lures (ammonium acetate and putrescine)
   captured as many Mexican fruit flies as the traditional torula
   yeast/borax slurry, but with far fewer (ratio 5:1) nontarget insects.
   Ninety percent of the nontarget insects were dipterans. Consequently,
   neither trap is efficacious against other citrus Pests, which are mainly
   Hemiptera or Lepidoptera. Although the nontarget catch is sometimes
   referred to as ``trash,{''} many nontarget insects are beneficials,
   including predators and parasites (especially tachinids). The traps with
   synthetic lures killed fewer of these beneficials by a ratio of 4:1
   compared with the yeast-baited traps. Certain taxa, notably the
   chrysopids and halictid bees, exhibited a somewhat greater preference
   (10 and 50\%, respectively) for the synthetic lures. Overall, with
   regard to the deployment of the newer baits, the threat to predators,
   parasites, and pollinators was found to be negligible, and certainly
   much less than that posed by the traditional traps.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of planting density on fruit size of vertically trained
   watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. et Nakai) plants was
   investigated with regard to light-interception characteristics and
   photosynthetic production. Watermelon plants, grafted on bottle gourd,
   were grown in a glasshouse at different planting densities. Two vines
   per plant were allowed to grow and trained vertically. One
   hand-pollinated fruit per plant was set around the 15th, node on either
   vine. The solar radiation and photosynthetic rate of individual leaves
   during fruit development period were determined by an integrated
   solarimeter film and a portable photosynthesis system, respectively.
   Fruit size was significantly decreased as the planting density
   increased, whereas soluble solids content of the fruits was affected
   little. The solar radiation and the photosynthetic rate of the
   individual leaves gradually decreased as the leaf position became lower
   at all planting densities on account of shading; those at lower leaves
   tended to decrease as the planting density increased. Fruit size was
   closely related to both the total solar radiation and the photosynthetic
   production per plant. In conclusion, the difference in fruit size among
   the planting densities is attributed to the photosynthetic productivity
   of the whole plant, which is mainly a function of the total solar
   radiation. This paper appears to be the first trial relating the
   influence of light interception and photosynthetic rates in high density
   plantings of vertically trained watermelon plants on fruit size.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation biologists, evolutionary ecologists and agricultural
   biologists require an improved understanding of how pollinators utilize
   space and share resources. Using microsatellite markers, we conducted a
   genetic analysis of space use and resource sharing at several spatial
   scales among workers of two ecologically dissimilar bumble bee species
   (Bombus terrestris and B. pascuorum) foraging in an urban landscape
   (London, UK). At fine scales, the relatedness of workers visiting small
   patches of flowers did not differ significantly from zero. Therefore,
   colonies shared flower patches randomly with other colonies, suggesting
   that worker scent-marks deterring visits to unrewarding flowers have not
   evolved as signals benefiting nestmates. To investigate space use at
   intermediate scales, we developed a program based on Thomas \& Hill's
   maximum likelihood sibship reconstruction method to estimate the number
   of colonies utilizing single sites. The average number of colonies (95\%
   confidence limits) sending workers to forage at sites of approximate to1
   ha in area was 96 colonies (84-118) in B. terrestris and 66 colonies
   (61-76) in B. pascuorum. These values are surprisingly high and
   suggested that workers travelled far from their colonies to visit the
   sites. At the landscape scale, there was little or no genetic
   differentiation between sites. We conclude that urban habitats support
   large bumble bee populations and are potentially valuable in terms of
   bumble bee conservation. In addition, bumble bee-mediated gene flow in
   plants is likely to occur over large distances and plant-bumble bee
   conservation requires landscape-scale action.}},

   nucellar plants of Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. in an open pollinated
   population, and to evaluate the efficiency of the morphology and
   vigor-based selection method of nucellar plants. Seeds from mature
   fruits were sowed in plastic tubes of 50 cm(3). After 150 days the
   plants were transferred to plastic bags of 4,8 dm(3). Leaf morphology
   and height of plants were evaluated 300 days after sowing. Genetic
   characterization was carried out by isoenzymatic systems. In average,
   1.07 plants were obtained per seed and the maximum value was two plants
   per seed. In these cases, both plants were characterized as nucellar by
   isoenzymes, although showing different and smaller size than the average
   of the rest of the plants. Zygotic plants identified were 5.9\% of the
   population and were distributed in the classes of smaller size, showing
   genetic depression. Plants showing hybrid vigor were not observed. The
   differentiation of nucellar from zygotic plants was not possible by leaf
   morphological characters. The visual elimination of the smaller plants,
   about 30\% of the population, is an efficient method to select
   trifoliata nucellar plants produced in plastic tubes under protected

Abstract = {{The reproductive ecology of Medicagocitrina was studied in the

   large floral visitors for tripping and pollination. Several

   adaptation to an isolated environment characterised by scarcity of
   appropriate pollinators. As a result of this scarcity, fruit and seed
   set under natural conditions were significantly lower compared to
   hand-pollination treatments. The main flower visitors were mostly flies

   dehiscence. Chamaecrista keyensis received substantially more visits by
   X. micans, but fewer visits from Melissodes spp. in urban-edge vs.
   forest sites. Aerial mosquito spraying may exacerbate the existing
   pollinator limitation suffered by C keyensis by reducing the number of
   visits by the buzz-pollinating bees. Individuals of C. keyensis at urban
   edges produced fewer seeds per fruit than did individuals in a pristine
   forest mainly because of greater insect seed predation.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-year male phenological field study was performed on the represented
   species of the genus Cupressus in the city of Cordoba (Spain): Cupressus
   arizonica, C. macrocarpa and C. sempervirens. A new and complete
   description of the phenological stages of the male flower of Cupressus
   was obtained. Five phenological phases were described using internal and
   external bud/flower traits. In general, different pollination periods
   were recorded for the 3 years. C. arizonica flowered from 20 to 23 days
   before the others. C. macrocarpa and C. sempervirens flowered almost
   simultaneously, although the former appeared to flower slightly earlier.
   The total number of trees per square kilometre was estimated taking into
   account the total number of trees of each species in the city and
   surrounding area (5 km radius from the city centre). Data corresponding
   to total pollen production per tree were taken from a previous study in
   which the partial contribution of each species to atmospheric pollen was
   estimated. Considering all these parameters, a theoretical airborne
   pollen model was proposed. A correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.46 was
   obtained when comparing this model with the average airborne pollen
   concentrations for the last 18 years. According to the proposed model, C
   macrocarpa trees accounted for 78\% of total airborne pollen, while C.
   sempervirens and C. arizonica accounted for only 18\% and 4\%,
   respectively. The final objective of this study was to provide
   additional biological information on these species responsible for
   winter pollinosis in the Mediterranean area. Forecasting pollen emission
   and dispersion has an important application in public health warnings.}},

Abstract = {{Seed set, size, viability and germination requirements were investigated
   for two rare (Acacia ausfeldii and A. williamsonii) and three common (A.
   pycnantha, A. genistifolia and A. paradoxa) co-occurring congeners in
   box-ironbark eucalypt forests near Bendigo, south-east Australia to
   investigate correlates of rarity. Seed size was significantly smaller
   for the two rare species and germinants were less able to emerge from
   deeper sowing depths than were the larger seeded common congeners. All
   species had a strong heat-stimulated germination response. While the
   rare A. ausfeldii showed strong germination only at the highest
   temperature treatment (100degreesC), the common and widespread A.
   pycnantha showed strong germination across a broad range of temperatures
   (60-100degreesC) likely to be experienced by soil-stored seeds during a
   fire. Seed viability, number of seeds per plant, and number of firm,
   aborted and eaten seeds per pod varied between species, but the pattern
   of variation was not related to rarity. Small seed size and a very
   specific temperature requirement for germination may help to explain
   rarity in A. ausfeldii, and to a lesser extent in A. williamsonii. Fires
   are often patchy and heating of the soil is likely to be highly
   spatially variable, so species with germination responses to a broad
   range of temperatures have an advantage over those that respond only to
   a narrow range. A narrower range of soil depths from which seeds can
   emerge will further reduce the proportion of the seed bank that might
   recruit following fire. Human impacts on species habitats, such as
   fragmentation, loss of topsoil through mining, timber harvesting,
   grazing and urbanization, and consequent reduction in fire intensity,
   are likely to have further contributed to rarity in these species. The
   role of pollination and other factors in relation to population size is
   the subject of further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Consequences of habitat fragmentation have garnered much attention over
   the past few decades. The resulting literature has been useful for
   understanding how land-use changes influence population viability and
   community structure, but we are still hampered by a major aspect of the
   conceptual framework within which most fragmentation work arises.
   Specifically, habitat between fragments ('matrix') is usually treated as
   uniform and ecologically irrelevant. However, recent work on animals
   shows that matrix habitat can profoundly influence within-fragment
   dynamics. We review related evidence for plants. Various matrix types
   (e.g. clear-cutting, agriculture, or urbanization) can act in different
   ways to alter resource availability and movement of pollinators, seed
   dispersers, and herbivores. Inclusion of matrix qualities in
   fragmentation studies is further complicated since most matrices are not
   static; sites in which timber harvesting or agriculture occur develop
   through succession or change as crops are rotated, respectively, such
   that their influence on within-fragment processes vary temporally. Also,
   many plants are not restricted to remnants of original habitat. Using
   studies of forest understory plants, we summarize work showing how
   diversity can change significantly through time in matrix. Understanding
   the persistence of a species across fragmented landscapes will require
   more attention to matrix habitat, and to the species utilizing the
   matrix.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important goals in the genetic improvement of lemon in
   the Mediterranean area is certainly the obtainment of new genotypes
   tolerant or resistant to mal secco disease. Two lemon cybrids (one
   diploid and one autotetraploid) with an intermediate degree of
   resistance to mal secco disease, spontaneously obtained by symmetric
   protoplast fusion between `Valencia' orange and `Femminello' lemon, were
   used as mother plants in backcrosses with a diploid clone of
   `Femminello' lemon tolerant to the mal secco disease (LTMS) to improve
   tolerance and fruit quality. Since `Femminello' lemon normally
   reproduces apomictically by nucellar embryony, an embryo-rescue
   technique was applied 105 days after pollination to recover zygotic
   embryos. Sixty-six plantlets were regenerated as follows: 20 from the
   4nX2n cross and 46 from the 2nX2n cross. In order to distinguish zygotic
   embryos from nucellars, flow cytometry was applied on all the 66
   plantlets; and a modified amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP)
   technique and microsatellite analysis were carried out on a sample of 20
   seedlings (six triploids and 14 diploids). Here, we report the
   usefulness and reliability of the tested techniques and discuss the
   results obtained. Flow cytometry (FCM) was useful only in interploid
   crosses. identifying six triploids, four of which were also detected by
   simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis and only two by modified AFLP.
   Among the 14 tested diploids, five zygotic genotypes were identified by
   SSR and four by modified AFLP. In our hands. the SSR technique appeared
   to be more suitable than modified AFLP. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

   presence of gynanadromorphs at low frequencies in two species suggests

Abstract = {{The extreme male dimorphisms exhibited by some non-pollinating fig wasps
   have often been thought to be a consequence of a genetic polymorphism,
   and have been cited as an example of how frequency-dependent selection

   proportions of each morph in one generation should reflect their mating
   success in previous generations. Here, we test the genetic polymorphism
   assumption in the male dimorphic species Otitesella pseudoserrata , and
   demonstrate that it is impossible for such a mechanism to generate
   alternative morphs in the highly variable proportions observed. These
   results suggest that male dimorphism is not a classic case of
   alternative strategies attributable to alternative alleles at a single
   locus. Rather, it would seem that although the fitnesses of the
   alternative morphologies are frequency dependent, their actual

Abstract = {{High-oil corn (Zea mays L.) grain is a valuable component of feed for
   monogastric livestock. One method of increasing the concentration of oil
   in corn grain is the TopCross method. With TopCross, ears of a
   cytoplasmic male-sterile, normal-oil hybrid are pollinated by a
   male-fertile, high-oil synthetic hybrid. The concentration of oil in the
   resulting grain is increased because of xenia effects. Kernels of
   high-oil corn typically have a larger germ and a smaller endosperm than
   kernels of comparable normal hybrids. The growth of Aspergillus fiavus
   Link:Fr within germ tissue has been reported to be more extensive than
   that on the whole corn kernel; therefore, the severity of Aspergillus
   ear rot could be more extensive and aflatoxin concentrations could be
   higher in high-oil grain produced by TopCross than in grain with a lower
   concentration of oil. The objective of this study was to compare
   Aspergillus ear rot severity levels and aflatoxin concentrations in the
   grains of hybrids crossed with high-oil or-normal-oil pollinators.
   Fifteen hybrids were evaluated in 1998 and 1999 in Urbana, Ill. Primary
   ears were inoculated with A. flavus and evaluated for susceptibility to
   Aspergillus ear rot and aflatoxin production in grain. Concentrations of
   aflatoxin and oil in corn kernels were significantly higher for high-oil
   hybrids than for normal-oil hybrids; however, ear rot severity was
   unaffected by the type of pollinator. These results suggest that grain
   from high-oil hybrids is at greater risk for aflatoxin contamination
   during some growing seasons.}},

Abstract = {{We studied how the genetic structure helps in understanding the
   demographic history of a species and predicting its future, using the
   endangered orchid Spiranthes spiralis.
   A Parisian population was mapped during three consecutive years. Its
   genetic structure was assessed using isozymes and compared with several
   populations from southern France. Seed dispersal distances were
   experimentally evaluated. Computer simulations were performed to
   reconstruct the population history.
   Unlike southern France populations, the Parisian population exhibited
   two genetically distinct patches. Seed dispersal was limited to the
   neighbourhood of the fruiting plants. The simulations showed that the
   best explanation for the observed genetic structure was a recent
   colonization event by two small groups of founders.
   Current patterns of gene flow should result in a rapid genetic and
   demographic homogenization. New populations of S. spiralis could be
   successfully established by few founders and exhibit significant growth
   rates without any detrimental effects of inbreeding. This offers insight
   into the successful management of endangered plant species in urban

Abstract = {{The pollen spectra of natural populations of the honey bee (Apis cerana
   Fabricius) were determined. Forty-one families of flowering plants were
   identified and pollen pellets from 101 colonies of A. cerana were
   collected from various areas of the Philippines. The major pollen types
   were Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Mimosa diplotricha Mart. ex
   Sauvallo, Mimosa pudica L., Callistemon citrinus (Curt.) Stapf, Zea mays
   L., Cocos nucifera L., Pterocarpus indicus Wild., Muntingia calabura L.
   and unidentified species of the family Ulmaceae. The pollen spectra of
   honey bees were generally homogeneous. Only the samples from Baguio and
   Benguet (Luzon highland) were distinct, characterized by the presence of
   species that grow well in colder areas. Diversity of the pollen spectra
   had no relation with geographical origin.}},

Journal = {{THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{826-836}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Five genetic linkage maps were constructed for the parents of three
   progenies: Citrus aurantium (A) x Poncirus trifoliata var. Flying Dragon
   (Pa), C. volka-meriana (V) x R trifoliata var. Rubidoux (Pv) and a
   self-pollination of P. trifoliata var. Flying Dragon (Pp). The number of
   polymorphic markers assayed ranged from 48 for Pa to 120 for A according
   to the heterozygosity of each parental. As our focus was on genome
   comparison, most of the markers were newly generated simple sequence
   repeats. Inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphisms based on four
   retrotransposon sequences isolated from Citrus spp were also used to
   saturate the maps. These polymorphisms were much more frequent in A (53)
   than in Pa (15) and randomly distributed throughout both genomes. Since
   comparative genomics and quantitative trait locus analysis applicability
   depends on the reliability of marker ordering, the causes of variation
   in marker order were investigated. Around 25\% of the markers showed
   gametal segregation distortions. Segregation distortions were also
   observed at the zygotic level towards a reduction in the observed
   frequency of homozygotes from that expected in linkage groups 5 and 7.
   The presence of balanced lethal factors or gametal incompatibility genes
   in those genomic regions would explain a zygotic advantage of
   heterozygotes at these specific regions. Four differences in genomic
   organization were observed; three are putative translocations and affect
   homeologous linkage groups 3, 7 and 11, where highly distorted markers
   are found. Other causes of variation in marker order are also discussed:
   the introduction of new markers in the map, lowering the LOD score and
   the mapping software. These results represent the first comparative
   mapping analysis among Citrus and Poncirus species.}},

Pages = {{249-255}},
Abstract = {{Plants of the Urticaceae family can develop into a pest on soils
   enriched with nitrogen. Urticaceae pollen is a biohazard because it
   elicits severe pollinosis. Pollen grains were sampled by using a Lanzoni
   seven-day-recording trap from February 1995-December 2000 in the
   atmosphere of the city of Ponferrada (Leon, North Western Spain). The
   Spearman test was used to analyse the statistical correlation between
   Urticaceae pollen and certain meteorological factors in different main
   pollination periods. Maximum values are reached in June and July,
   minimum levels are recorded in January and December. The parameters
   bearing the greatest positive influence on the occurrence of Urticaceae
   pollen grains are: temperature (maximum, minimum and mean), humidity
   (absolute, wet-bulb temperature, dew point and mixing ratio) and south
   western wind direction; negative parameters are: relative humidity,
   rainfall and period without wind. The highest correlation coefficients
   were obtained with temperature and wet-bulb. Absolute humidity and
   wet-bulb temperature yielded better correlation than relative humidity;
   hence, these two parameters must be included in this type of study. The
   use of one main pollination period or another in statistical analysis
   has an influence on the coefficient value. The behaviour of the pollen
   grains in the atmosphere during the year also influences the results.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{35-55}},
Abstract = {{The obligate pollination mutualisin between yuccas (Agavaceae) and yucca
   moths (Lepidoptera, Prodoxidae), in which the adult moth pollinates
   yucca flowers and her progeny feed on developing seeds, is one of the
   classically cited examples of coevolution. While known since 1872, our
   understanding of the ecology and evolution of this association has
   increased dramatically in the past decade. Here I review current
   information on organismal diversity and phylogenetic relationships,
   ecological relationships, origin and reversal of the mutualism, and the
   potential for analyzing patterns of co-speciation and the historical
   role of coevolution on specific traits in driving diversification in the
   interaction. Major novel developments in recent years include the
   recognition of a large species complex of pollinators, previously
   thought to be one polyphagous species; a majority of all moth species
   are monophagous. Considerable life history diversity has been unveiled,
   and mechanisms that maintain a mutualistic equilibrium by preventing
   over-exploitation documented. Phylogenctic and ecological information,
   including data from other, newly discovered facultative pollinators in
   the Prodoxidae, have been used to erect a hypothesis for the evolution
   of obligate mutualism. Application of a molecular clock to phylogenetic
   data suggests that the plant-moth association arose at least 40 Mya, and
   that the obligate mutualisin evolved very quickly after this event. Two
   separate events of reversal of mutualism have been identified, involving
   derived ``cheater{''} moth species that oviposit into fruits resulting
   from pollination by other pollinator species. This appears to have
   happened not through selection for cheating, but rather as a byproduct
   of a phenological shift to an unexploited seed resource, in which case
   pollination behavior became redundant. Analyses of parallel
   diversification and character coevolution are hampered by incomplete
   phylogenetic information at the species level, especially for the
   plants, but also for the pollinators. Available data indicate
   considerable deviation from strict co-speciation, and no evident
   examples of this process. Analyses of the role of coevolutionary
   processes in driving the diversification of yuccas and yucca moths will
   be possible once fully resolved phylogenies become available.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted in Department of Horticulture, Faculty of
   Agriculture, University of Cukurova in 1999 and 2000. Watermelon
   {[}Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum and Nakai] cultivar Crimson Tide
   was grafted onto 10 different rootstocks. Cucurbita moschata, Cucurbita
   maxima and Lagenaria siceraria were open pollinated cultivars, and
   Strong Tosa, Gold Tosa, P360 (Cucurbita maxima x Cucurbita moschata),
   Skopje, Emphasis, 216 and FRG ( Lagenaria spp.) were hybrid cultivars.
   The ungrafted Crimson Tide watermelon cultivar was used as the control.
   Plants were grown under low tunnel conditions until the outdoor
   temperature was suitable (22-25degreesC) for watermelon growth. Our
   results showed that while survival rate was low (65\%) in Cucurbita type
   rootstocks, it was high (95\%) in Lagenaria type rootstocks. Grafted
   plants flowered about 10 days earlier and showed more vigorous
   vegetative growth than the control plants. Grafted plants had up to
   148\% higher fresh weights than control plants. Similarly, grafted
   plants showed 42-180\% higher dry weight, 58-100\% more leaves and
   larger leaf area as compared with the control. In total yield, Lagenaria
   type rootstocks produced a higher yield but Cucurbita type rootstocks
   produced a lower yield than the control. While control plants had 6.43
   kg/m(2) yield, Lagenaria type rootstocks produced 27-106\% higher yield
   than the control. In contrast, Cucurbita type rootstocks had 127-240\%
   less yield than the control. This could be attributed to incompatibility
   of Cucurbita rootstocks because some of the plants died before harvest.
   The study showed that rootstock choices influence plant growth as well
   as yield and quality of scion fruit, suggesting an important
   consideration in the potential use of grafting applications in
   watermelon.}},

   populations from 14 resistant forage-type plants (F) and 20 turf-types
   (T) were developed using polycross (PX) and open pollination (OP)
   progenies. A two-stage controlled environment inoculation was used for
   screening and selection for two cycles. Direct selection response was
   determined after two artificial inoculations in a controlled
   environment. Indirect selection response for seed yield was measured,
   using the same plants as the direct selection study, in the field using
   natural inoculation for 4 yr. Plants with resistant reaction, based on
   pustule type, increased from 5 to 54\% in the F population and from 6 to
   50\% in the T after two cycles of PX selection and from 5 to 63\%, and
   from 6 to 50\% in the F and T populations, respectively, after one cycle
   of OP followed by one cycle of PX selection. In each selection scheme,
   the largest increase came from the first PX cycle. Seed yield of tall
   fescue with improved stem rust resistance was higher than for
   susceptible populations or cultivars with heavy stem rust presence
   (1998), but yields were similar with no rust pressure (1999). These
   results indicate that seed yields in tall fescue can be maintained using
   genetic resistance to stem rust sufficient to slow or eliminate disease
   epidemic development.}},

Pages = {{207-220}},
Abstract = {{Field performance of maize varies substantially among various types of
   germplasm, such as- hybrics, inbred lines, and often with open
   pollinated varieties (OPVs). Variations in per se performance is better
   realized under optimal growing conditions, and further widened with
   increase in level of stresses. We examined sub-tropical/mid-altitude
   germplasm, including promising hybrids, OPVs and inbred lines under
   different growing conditions, including optimal conditions, mild-stress
   (double population density) and severe drought stress. At vegetative
   growth stage, dry mater partitioning between vegetative and reproductive
   plant parts, proportion of dry matter allocated to leaf growth in
   relation to stem, and within reproductive parts the amount of dry matter
   available for ear development varied significantly among the types of
   germplasm, across the growing conditions. The best performing genotypes,
   both within a germplasm type and across the germplasm, showed relatively
   more biomass allocation to leaf at the cost of stein dry weight, and
   more city matter accumulation for ear development at the cost of both
   tassel and stem biomass. Apart from relatively more leaf area, the
   longevity of active leaf area duration was one of the important
   characteristics of superior germplasm, across the types of germplasm and
   growing conditions. Comparatively more cob weight at anthesis was
   positively correlated with grain yield under drought stress. However,
   under unstressed or mild stress conditions the relationship was
   significant only with inbred lines. Across the environments, striking
   difference was observed for percent kernel abortion during early stage
   of grain filling (lag phase), both among the germplasm, and also between
   the best and worst entries within a germplasm type. Rate of kernel
   growth day(-1) and length of grain filling period were comparatively
   higher with hybrids than with inbred lines and OPVs. Our findings
   indicate that these variations in constitutive traits might be the
   factors responsible for distinct differences in field performance of
   different types of germplasm. Emphasis on these constitutive traits
   during selection and improvement of germplasm may prove to be beneficial
   in improving the performance of genotypes across the unstressed and
   less-favorable environments.}},

   without honeybee pollination in a typical `parral' greenhouse in Campo
   de Nijar, Almeria, Spain. The area of the trial was completely isolated
   by means of a photoselective 50 mesh anti-insect net. The effects of two
   different plant growth regulators, 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4
   D) (amine salt) and forchlorfenuron
   {[}1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3-phenylurea or CPPU] on yield and seedless
   fruit induction were analysed. Experimental design consisted of
   completely randomised blocks. Six treatments were used: 8, 12 and 16 ppm
   of 2,4 D, and 50, 100 and 200 ppm of CPPU. CPPU treatments were sprayed
   only over female flowers at two different moments whereas 2,4-D was
   sprayed over the entire plant in a single treatment. Yield was
   significantly affected by the treatments. As the dosage of 2,4 D
   increased yield was reduced, though the opposite trend was found when
   considering CPPU. The highest yield was found at 200 ppm CPPU with 5.14
   kg m(-2), and the lowest at 50 ppm CPPU. The highest proportion of
   seedless fruits was found in 200 ppm CPPU, 97.8 \%, showing statistical
   differences with 50 and 100 ppm CPPU which only yielded 58.1 \% and 60.2
   \% respectively, but not with any of the 2,4 D treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Due to changes in land use, Pinus oocarpa Schiede stands are quickly
   disappearing in Mexico, in particular in the region of Uruapan, in the
   western state of Michoacan. In order to understand the genetic variation
   along altitudinal gradients and to generate guidelines for the
   conservation of forest genetic resources, we investigated isoenzymatic
   genetic variation among populations of P. oocarpa Schiede along an
   altitudinal gradient. Open-pollinated seeds from individual trees were
   collected from five natural populations along an altitudinal transect
   from 1500 m to 1100 in, one population every 100 in of altitude, near of
   Uruapan city, in Michoacan. We found polymorphism in eleven of twelve
   examined loci. The average observed heterozygosity value (H-o = 0.1147)
   was above the average expected heterozygosity value (H-e = 0.1020), but
   it did not deviate significantly from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium.
   Genetic differentiation among populations (over loci F-ST = 0.0011) was
   not significantly different from zero (p > 0.05). Comparisons for allele
   frequencies indicated no significant difference for all the tested pairs
   of populations. Average genetic distance was very low: 0.0054, and
   genetic flow among populations very high (N-m = 227). Results suggest a
   small excess of heterozygotes within populations, and a lack of genetic
   differentiation among the five populations, which can be considered a
   single panmitic unit. Considering the alarming deforestation rate in the
   region of Uruapan, Michoacan, we suggest the selection of at least one
   stand for conversion to a gene resource management unit. We suggest to
   select the population at 1200 m of altitude, which has the highest
   number of polymorphic loci (9 of 12) and the highest average number of
   alleles per loci (1.92).}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem services are critical to human survival; in selected cases,
   maintaining these services provides a powerful argument for conserving
   biodiversity. Yet, the ecological and economic underpinnings of most
   services are poorly understood, impeding their conservation and
   management. For centuries, farmers have imported colonies of European
   honey bees (Apis mellifera) to fields and orchards for pollination
   services. These colonies are becoming increasingly scarce, however,
   because of diseases, pesticides, and other impacts. Native bee
   communities also provide pollination services, but the amount they
   provide and how this varies with land management practices are unknown.
   Here, we document the individual species and aggregate community
   contributions of native bees to crop pollination, on farms that varied
   both in their proximity to natural habitat and management type (organic
   versus conventional). On organic farms near natural habitat, we found
   that native bee communities could provide full pollination services even
   for a crop with heavy pollination requirements (e.g., watermelon,
   Citrullus lanatus), without the intervention of managed honey bees. All
   other farms, however, experienced greatly reduced diversity and
   abundance of native bees, resulting in insufficient pollination services
   from native bees alone. We found that diversity was essential for
   sustaining the service, because of year-to-year variation in community
   composition. Continued degradation of the agro-natural landscape will
   destroy this ``free{''} service, but conservation and restoration of bee
   habitat are potentially viable economic alternatives for reducing
   dependence on managed honey bees.}},

Abstract = {{Very little is known about the rate at which pollen grains are mobilized
   within insect-pollinated crop systems, and this is especially true the
   for commercial production of field-grown cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.),
   monoecious muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.), and triploid watermelon
   {[}Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. \& Nakai]. The rates of pollen
   depletion for these crops were therefore investigated on plots
   simulating commercial crop production using a mixed honey bee (Apis
   mellifera L.) and humble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) pollinator
   complex. At anthesis, staminate cucumber, muskmelon, and watermelon
   flowers contained on average 10539,11176, and 30739 pollen
   grains/flower, respectively. At the time flowers closed in the early
   afternoon (1300 to 1400 FIR), only 61\% of the total pollen produced had
   been removed from staminate cucumber flowers, 44\% to 62\% from
   muskmelon, and 81\% from watermelon flowers. The results suggest that
   total pollen production in these crops may not necessarily reflect total
   pollen availability to floral visitors (bees). However, of the total
   amount of pollen actually removed per flower, >57\% occurred during the
   2 h following flower anthesis of cucumber and muskmelon, and >77\%
   occurred during the 2 h following flower anthesis of watermelon. Thus,
   most of the accessible pollen was removed shortly after anthesis, which
   is when these crops are most receptive to pollination. Nonviable
   triploid and viable diploid watermelon pollen were removed at similar
   rates (P = 0.4604). While correlation analyses were not possible for the
   influence of variable bee abundance on pollen depletion rates, higher
   bee populations in one year appeared to increase the rate at which
   pollen grains were removed from staminate flowers.}},

   alert level was reached in week 31 in all sites and an incapacitating
   level was then attained in weeks 33 and 34. Those most affected can

Abstract = {{Gradient odour emissions in the inflorescence of the Araceae Sauromatum
   guttatum aim to attract a wide range of insects into the floral chamber.
   The volatiles are emitted from the spadix appendix, as well as the
   club-shaped organs located directly above the female flowers. Volatile
   analysis of various regions of the appendix and the club-shaped organs
   led to the identification of 163 compounds emitted by the appendix top,
   124 by the appendix bottom and 105 by the club-shaped organs. The
   dominant compounds in all investigated tissues were monoterpenes and
   sesquiterpenes that were accompanied by numerous aliphatic, aromatic,
   sulphur- and nitrogen-containing compounds of other biosynthetic
   origins. Within the appendix, levels of one monoterpene,
   beta-citronellene, showed considerable variation; it constituted the
   major compound in the appendix top and gradually decreased in the lower
   regions, being undetectable in the base. The other prominent
   monoterpenes, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, alpha-phellandrene
   and beta-phellandrene, showed no changes along the appendix. The
   club-shaped organs located at the base of the floral chamber also
   emitted volatiles, though of different composition: the monoterpenes
   alpha-terpinolene and linalool constituted major amounts, instead of
   beta-pinene and beta-citronellene. These qualitative differences and the
   absence of methanethiol in the club-shaped organs result in them having
   a pleasant flowery odour, in contrast to the foul-smelling appendix. The
   quantitative spatial variation of beta-citronellene within the appendix
   and the existence of a second osmophore within the floral chamber,
   emitting a different scent, suggest that both phenomena might
   participate in creating an odour gradient for efficient pollinator
   attraction. Apart from beta-citronellene, nearly all major components of
   the appendix have already been identified as specific attractants to a
   broad range of insects that have been observed to be lured to the
   odour-emitting inflorescence. Most likely, the club-shaped organ odour
   serves to induce the insects attracted by the appendix to move towards
   the floral chamber. A comparison of the relative emission rates
   demonstrated that performance of the club-shaped organs equals or even
   exceeds the appendix. In the club-shaped organ tissues, multivesicular
   bodies, originating from lipid droplets, are the most notable organelles
   before and during odour production. They fuse with the plasma membrane,
   releasing their content to the exterior of the cell. The exit route for
   the volatiles is an extensive intercellular channel system that extends
   to the surface of the club-shaped organs. Thus, chemical and
   ultrastructural analyses suggest, in contrast to previous studies, that
   the club-shaped organs function as an osmophore rather than a food
   source for insects.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of the large earth bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (L.), in
   native vegetation were collated to determine the extent to which this
   exotic species has invaded Tasmanian native vegetation during the first
   9 years after its introduction. The range of B. terrestris now
   encompasses all of Tasmania's major vegetation types, altitudes from sea
   level to 1260 m a.s.l., and the entire breadth of annual precipitation
   in the state from more than 3200 mm to less than 600 mm. Observations of
   workers carrying pollen, together with the presence of large numbers of
   bumblebees at many localities across this range indicate that colonies
   are frequently established in native vegetation. Evidence that colonies
   are often successful was obtained from repeated observations of the
   species during more than 1 year at particular sites. Unequivocal
   evidence of colonies was obtained from six National Parks, including
   four of the five in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (WHA).
   Indeed, the species has been present in the WHA for at least as long as
   it has in the city of Hobart, where it was first recorded. In south-
   western Tasmania, evidence of colonies was obtained up to 40 km from
   gardens, 61 km from small towns and 93 km from large towns. Hence,
   contrary to previous suggestions, the species is established in the most
   remote parts of Tasmania and is not dependent on introduced garden
   plants. Given their strong record of invasion, it is likely that B.
   terrestris will form feral populations on the mainland of Australia and
   in many other parts of the world if introduced. Because of their likely
   negative impacts on native animals and plants, and potential to enhance
   seed production in weeds, the spread of bumblebees should be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Watermelon fruit that results from pollination with pollen irradiated
   with soft-X-ray contains only empty seed, although the fruit develops to
   a normal size. In this study the processes of fertilization and embryo
   formation were compared between unirradiated and irradiated pollen in
   order to reveal the mechanisms by, which seedless fruits are generated.
   The use of soft-X-irradiated pollen resulted in normal pollen tube
   penetration into the synergid and discharge of sperm cells. Two to three
   days after pollination, the sperm nucleus was present alongside the egg
   nucleus before fusion. The polar nuclei divided and the endosperm cell
   spread in the embryo sac before zygote division. A globular embryo was
   observed on day, 7 to 10 after pollination. Subsequently, the embryo
   failed to differentiate to organ tissue and degenerated. These results
   indicate that double fertilization occurred after pollination with the
   irradiated pollen and that abortion of the embryo results from
   soft-X-ray induced chromosomal abnormalities in generative nucleus.}},

   screened, amplifying 640 fragments, 77.2\% monomorphics between the
   parents. The Jaccard coefficient was used to estimate the genetic
   similarity among the hybrids, the UPGMA method to establish the
   phenogram. (NTSYS 1.7) and the software BOOD to determine the
   significance of each cluster. The results indicated that `Pera' sweet
   orange heterozygosity degree is higher than `Cravo' mandarin, with 180
   and 126 loci in heterozygose, respectively. It was observed high genetic
   similarity between the parents, characterized by the low degree of RAPID
   polymorphism. Significant statistic groups were not established among
   the hybrids and the parents, showing that the hybrid genetic
   constitution was originated by independent RAPID markers segregation.
   Then, the ligation effect was broken because of the sample size. Hybrids
   with high genetic similarity degree in relation to `Cravo' mandarin and
   `Pera' sweet orange could be easily selected using RAPD markers.}},

Abstract = {{Ponds in the Saijo Basin of western Japan contain three Nuphar taxa, two
   of which are threatened. It has been proposed previously that the rarest
   of the three, hitherto Nuphar japonica var. saijoensis, may have
   originated from natural hybridization between N. japonica and Nuphar
   pumila subsp. oguraensis. To test this hypothesis, we conducted
   morphological analyses, pollen and seed fertility tests, and a RAPD
   analysis of all three pond-lilies. Individuals of the putative hybrid
   exhibit intermediate morphology, reduced pollen and seed viability, and
   genetic additivity in comparison to the other species. The putative
   hybrid is also limited geographically to an area of parental sympatry.
   Our findings support the hybrid origin of N. japonica var. saijoensis,
   which we recognize nomenclaturally as Nuphar x saijoensis. Loss and
   degradation of habitat due to urbanization is a major threat to the
   survival of this taxon. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We characterized the mechanism of seedlessness of Keraji (Citrus keraji
   hort. ex Tanaka), cultivar grown in Kikaijima island, Kagoshima. This
   cultivar is a diploid (2n=18) that produces a medium amount of fertile
   pollen which readily fertilizes other citrus cultivars. It is highly
   parthenocarpic, setting 30-50\% of unpollinated flowers. When Keraji
   flowers are hand-pollinated with `Hassaku' pollen, these fruits produce
   only 2 to 3 seeds. However, 19-20\% of these hand-pollinated flowers set
   seedless fruits, whereas 30-38\% of open-pollinated flowers set
   parthenocarpically. Self-pollinated flowers resulted in 91-93\%
   parthenocarpic fruits; the remaining 7-9\% of the fruits had only one
   seed. Six days after pollination, the self-pollinated flowers had 1.4
   pollen tubes at the base of the style, a figure that is much lower than
   that in cross-pollinated flowers with `Hassaku' pollen (61 +/- 7.4)
   These observation demonstrated that seedlessness of Keraji results from
   strong female sterility, self-incompatibility and parthe-nocarpy.}},

Abstract = {{We have isolated Cv3h, a cDNA clone from the developing seeds of
   watermelon, and have demonstrated significant amino acid homology with
   gibberellin (GA) 3beta-hydroxylases. This cDNA clone was expressed in
   Escherichia coli as a fusion protein that oxidized GA(9) and GA(12) to
   GA(4) and GA(14), respectively. The Cv3h protein had the highest
   similarity with pumpkin GA 2beta,3beta-hydroxylase, but did not possess
   2beta-hydroxylation function. RNA blot analysis showed that the gene was
   expressed primarily in the inner parts of developing seeds, up to 10 d
   after pollination (DAP). In the parthenocarpic fruits induced by
   treatment with 1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3-phenylurea (CPPU), the embryo
   and endosperm of the seeds were undeveloped, whereas the integumental
   tissues, of maternal origin, showed nearly normal development. Cv3h mRNA
   was undetectable in the seeds of CPPU-treated fruits, indicating that
   the GA 3beta-hydroxylase gene was expressed in zygotic cells. In our
   analysis of endogenous GAs from developing seeds, GA(9) and GA(4) were
   detected at high levels but those of GA(20) and GA(1) were very low.
   This demonstrates that GA biosynthesis in seeds prefers a
   non-13-hydroxylation pathway over an early 13-hydroxylation pathway. We
   also analyzed endogenous GAs from seeds of the parthenocarpic fruits.
   The level of bioactive GA(4) was much lower there than in normal seeds,
   indicating that bioactive GAs, unconnected with Cv3h, exist in
   integumental tissues during early seed development.}},

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{109}},

Pages = {{51-56}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Asthma incidence has long been linked to pollen, even though
   pollen grains are too large to penetrate into the airways where
   asthmatic responses originate. Pollen allergens found in small,
   respirable particles have been implicated in a number of asthma
   epidemics, particularly ones following rainfall or thunderstorms.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to determine how pollen allergens
   form the respirable aerosols necessary for triggering asthma.
   Methods: Flowering grasses were humidified and then dried in a
   controlled-environment chamber connected to a cascade impactor and an
   aerosol particle counter. Particles shed from the flowers were analyzed
   with high-resolution microscopy and immunolabeled with rabbit anti-Phl p
   1 antibody, which is specific for group 1 pollen allergens.
   Results: Contrary to what has been reported in other published accounts,
   most of the pollen in this investigation remained on the open anthers of
   wind pollinated plants unless disturbed-eg, by wind. Increasing humidity
   caused anthers to close. After a cycle of wetting and drying followed by
   wind disturbance, grasses flowering within a chamber produced an aerosol
   of particles that were collected in a cascade impactor. These particles
   consisted of fragmented pollen cytoplasm in the size range 0.12 to 4.67
   mum; they were loaded with group I allergens.
   Conclusion: Here we provide the first direct observations of the release
   of grass pollen allergens as respirable aerosols. They can emanate
   directly from the flower after a moisture-drying cycle. This could
   explain asthmatic responses associated with grass pollination,
   particularly after moist weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) were
   compared for three aspects of pollinating behaviour on field-grown
   cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus). We
   measured: (1), diurnal foraging activity periods (as related to
   anthesis); (2), floral visitation rates (number of flowers visited per
   min by individual foragers); and (3), stigmatic pollen deposition
   (number of pollen grains deposited on stigmas after single bee visits to
   female flowers). B. impatiens was more effective than A. mellifera for
   all three parameters on both crops. B. impatiens initiated foraging
   activity 15-40 min before A. mellifera; both species continued foraging
   until flowers closed in early afternoon. B. impatiens consistently
   visited more flowers per min (P < 0.001) and deposited equal or greater
   amounts of pollen (P < 0.001) than A. mellifera, particularly during the
   initial hours of floral anthesis which is when these crops are most
   receptive to pollination. The data additionally suggest that researchers

Abstract = {{The reproductive biology of three sympatric species Pitcairnia flammea,
   P. corcovadensis and P. albiflos (Bromeliaceae) was studied on Corcovado
   Mountain in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Controlled pollination
   experiments were also conducted using plants transplanted to a
   greenhouse. The three species are self-compatible and interspecifically
   cross compatible, Pitcairnia corcovadensis was principally an autonomous
   self-pollinator, having scarce pollinator activity, anthers and stigmas
   at the same level, and absence of nectar. In P. flammea, many flowers
   opened per day. the stigma and anther were close to each other, and its
   nectar was regularly consumed by hummingbirds, all factors that promote
   geitonogamy in this species. Although fully self-compatible. P. albiflos
   always opened a few flowers per days showing an adaptation to
   cross-pollination. Observations during two flowering seasons showed that
   despite different times for peak flowering, blooming of these three
   species overlapped in April. They grow in mixed clumps that may
   facilitate promiscuous pollination between them but no intermediate
   forms were observed under natural conditions. The absence of temporal
   isolation, geographic isolation and isolation via post-pollination
   reproduction suggests that evolution toward selfing was important to
   avoid hybridization between these sympatric species.}},

Abstract = {{Generally, in controlled almond crosses made for scion breeding
   programmes, flowers are pollinated earlier than in natural conditions.
   Branches are not bagged, flowers are emasculated before anthesis (at
   balloon stage) and then pollinated immediately, to reduce chances of
   outcrossing and to ensure crossing, as a delay in the artificial
   pollination can prevent it due to unsettled climatic conditions.
   Usually, it is not necessary to repeat the pollination to obtain an
   acceptable fruit set if the weather is favourable. A second pollination,
   2-3 days after emasculation, coinciding with natural flower's anthesis,
   could be convenient to increase the fruit set in some cultivars. In this
   work, average fruit set obtained, applying one single artificial
   pollination, is compiled from 30 cultivars or selections used repeatedly
   as female genitors in the IRTA's breeding programme. Considerable
   differences have been recorded among cultivars, repeated in different
   years and crosses. Cultivars have been classified in 3 groups, according
   to their average fruit set: low (<15 \%), medium (15-30 \%) and high
   (>30 \%). Cultivars; with low fruit set should receive a second
   artificial pollination, or be only used as male genitors, while
   cultivars with high fruit set are good as female parents. `Anxaneta' can
   be cited as an example of a cultivar with a very low fruit set in this
   type of crosses (6 \%, using about 14.000 flowers in 29 crosses made
   during 9 years), being however very productive in natural pollination
   conditions. Opposite to it, `Lauranne' is a good example of excellent
   fruit setting (45 \%, using about 12.000 flowers in 18 crosses made
   during 8 years).}},

Abstract = {{A new method of producing seedless watermelon fruits by using pollen
   irradiated with soft-X-rays has been developed recently. This method
   enables seedless fruits to be produced from any diploid cultivar. To
   investigate how cropping season affects the formation of empty seeds, we
   compared July-harvesting culture (JHC) and December-harvesting culture
   (DHC) in 1999 using `Shimaou max RE' and in 2000 using `Fujihikari'. We
   also examined the effects of pollination time during the day and
   night-time temperature during the fruit development period on the
   formation of empty seeds. Empty seeds were categorized as
   semitransparent, white, or brown. Pollination time influenced neither
   the number nor the type of empty seeds. The percentage of fruits with
   brown empty seeds was higher in JHC than in DHC. The proportion of white
   empty seeds to total empty seeds tended to be higher in DHC than in JHC.
   The air temperature during the fruit development period was considerably
   higher in JHC than in DHC. The percentage of fruits that had brown empty
   seeds was higher at higher night-time temperature. We conclude that the
   formation of empty seeds is influenced by cropping season, and that high
   temperature during fruit development stimulates the formation of brown
   empty seeds, which lower the fruit quality of seedless watermelons.}},

Abstract = {{The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)
   began its genetic improvement research for selected woody horticultural
   species during the 1950s and 60s. The first perennial fruit-breeding
   program focused on grapevines and though directed mainly at varieties
   suitable for temperate and Mediterranean climatic regions, table grape
   selections have been identified for evaluation in tropical and
   subtropical areas. In addition, Marroo seedless, a CSIRO variety with
   field resistance to downy mildew and a high level of fruitfulness under
   tropical conditions, has been adopted to a limited extent in northern
   Australia. Breeding objectives for tropical and subtropical grapes
   include disease tolerance and adaptations to lower chill regimes to
   ensure uniform budburst and flowering.
   Genetic improvement programs have also been conducted for a range of
   other perennial horticultural species including citrus, avocado, mango,
   cashew, macadamia, guava, annonas, lychee and longan. Some of these are
   clearly suited to tropical and subtropical production regions while
   others are more ubiquitous in their adaptive range being suited to
   temperate, Mediterranean as well warmer climates. For example, mango
   breeding is directed at new varieties for the tropics and subtropics,
   while the citrus program focuses on key fruit quality characteristics
   that will lead to marketing advantages regardless of where the varieties
   are grown.
   This paper presents a review of some of CSIRO's conventional fruit
   breeding activities. Research of significance for tropical and
   subtropical regions as well as breeding methodologies are highlighted
   with reference to biological characteristics, such as flowering,
   juvenility and tree size, which influence research outputs and the
   delivery of key outcomes to industry.}},

Abstract = {{The perennial orchid Cypripedium acaule AIT. is an excellent model for
   investigating the cost of reproduction, that is the impact of current
   reproduction on future reproduction, growth, and survival. In
   Massachusetts, flowering plants do not produce fruit because pollination
   is inadequate. In three natural populations, non-fruiting control plants
   were contrasted with experimental plants that were hand-pollinated and
   made fruits. Experimental plants were hand-pollinated each year they
   flowered for 11 years. For each fruit that a plant produced, that
   plant's leaf area decreased by around 25 to 30 cm(2) in the following
   year; the probability of re-blooming in the following year decreased by
   around 5 to 10\%. Experimental effects were strongest after three to
   seven years; after this time, plant deaths and lack of flowering
   obscured. the experimental effects because of small sample size. An
   important component in this and related studies has been incorporating
   the public, in particular children, into field projects. Children and
   their teachers are eager to work with scientists on conservation
   projects involving natural history and plants. People are particularly
   eager to assist in restoring lost populations of wildflowers into urban
   parks. The impact of these studies is further extended by working with
   newspaper reporters and other forms of media to reach a wider audience.}},

Abstract = {{Gibberellin accumulation in citrus ovaries has been proposed as an
   activating signal for fruit set in citrus. Our data under tropical
   conditions associate pollination-dependent fruiting of `Valencia' orange
   with high ratios of growth promoters to inhibitors (G/I) in floral
   organs. Lower values of G/I were found in the parthenocarpic. `Marsh
   Seedless' grapefruit and `Ortanique' tangor, the latter a
   self-incompatible, seedless hybrid. In all the varieties, two kind of
   fruitlets were identified at the early stages of fruit development: (1)
   normal developing fruits, with high peel chlorophyll content, firmly
   attached to the stem (2) non-growing fruits with lower peel chlorophyll
   content, prone to early abscission. G/I values of firmly attached
   fruitlets were higher than those of non-growing, early abscising fruits
   during the fruit set period, In addition, higher absicisic (ABA) and
   ABA-like inhibitor accumulation as well as lower growth promoting
   substances were found in proximal abscission zones of abscising fruits.
   Furthermore, higher contents of jasmonic. acid-like compounds in floral
   organs and in developing fruits were found in the cultivars with
   stronger early fruit abscission, which suggest that ABA-like and
   jasmonic acid-like substances could play a shared role in fruit set and
   early fruit abscission. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Some sensitive pollen-allergic patients may experience
   perennial symptoms, and for these patients it is vitally important to
   know the concentration of grass-pollen allergens in their homes. The
   main objective of this study was to detect predictors associated with
   high grass allergen concentration in settled house dust during and
   outside the grass pollination season.
   Methods: We detected group 5 grass-pollen allergens in dust samples from
   randomly selected homes of three counties in the region of
   Sachsen-Anhalt: Hettstedt (n = 183), Zerbst (n = 152). and Bitterfeld (n
   = 119). Dust samples were collected from the floors of living rooms (LR)
   and children's rooms (CR) from April 1996 to March 1998.
   Results: Phl p 5 was detected in settled house dust in 91\% of the
   homes. The range was between undetectable (< 30 ng/m(2)) and 4300 ng Phl
   p 5/m(2) sampling area during grass pollination, and 1300 ng Phl p
   5/m(2) outside the pollination season, respectively. We observed a
   partially higher concentration of indoor allergenic activity several
   weeks after the grass-pollen peak. A positive association was found
   between Phl p 5 levels and total dust amounts throughout the year, Thus,
   we assume that grass allergens accumulate in settled house dust. During
   pollination, the Phl p 5 levels are 1.8 times higher in homes where
   vacuuming of carpets takes place only once a week or less than in those
   vacuumed daily. Furthermore, higher concentrations of Phl p 5 in settled
   floor dust can be expected in homes located within suburban areas (mean
   ratio {[}MR] 1.74) and prefabricated slab buildings (MR = 1.54).
   Conclusions: Quite high levels of Phl p 5 accumulate in settled house
   dust even during periods when no grass pollen is present in the
   atmosphere. The removal of dust by frequent cleaning reduces the indoor
   exposure to grass allergens. Such information is essential to train
   patients in allergen avoidance.}},

Abstract = {{The phenological response by three sympatric species of columnar cacti
   of the semi-arid island of Curacao (Stenocereus griseus, Subpilocereus
   repandus, and Pilosocereus lanuginosus) to recent rainfall was
   investigated during 21 months. Rainfall is the climatic cue most likely
   to affect bud formation on Curacao, and each species of cactus responded
   differently to it. Pilosocereus lanuginosus started budding immediately
   after rainfall, whereas Stenocereus griseus responded negatively with
   abortions and cessation of bud production within 2-3 weeks after rain.
   Subpilocereus repandus showed no response to rain within one month.
   Despite a long period of temporal overlap (81\% overlap) between the
   budding/flowering activity of Subpilocereus repandus and that of
   Stenocereus griseus, buds and/or flowers on Stenocereus griseus appeared
   more than a month earlier than on Subpilocereus repandus.
   The effect of plant size on phenology and how anthropogenic disturbance
   may affect cactus resource availability to nectar-feeders and frugivores
   were also examined. The larger the individual tree within a species, the
   more flowers were produced and the earlier the tree started to flower.
   Thus, the indiscriminate removal of columnar cacti for urban development
   can drastically affect the timing and availability of resources to
   threatened pollinators and other nectar-feeders, as well as to
   frugivores and omnivores. (C) 2001 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Relationships between total leaf area per plant and fruit weight were
   investigated in vertically and horizontally trained watermelon
   {[}Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. et Nakai] plants. Watermelon
   plants grafted on bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria Standl.) were grown
   in a glasshouse. In the vertically trained system, elongating shoots
   were initially suspended with polyethylene strings and then draped over
   horizontally stretched steel wire about 180 cm above the bed. In the
   horizontally trained system, shoots were spread on the ground. Each
   plant had one hand-pollinated fruit. In the vertically trained system,
   fruit was suspended in a cross-tied polyethylene string. In Experiment
   1, June-harvest culture, `Honey-syaruman', `Yoshino' and `Wase-tenryu'
   seedlings were planted at a density of 95.2 plants (.) a(-1) (95.2-190.5
   shoots (.) a(-1) with a LAI <1). In Experiment 2, November-harvest
   culture, one group of `Wase-tenryu' seedlings was planted at densities
   of 95.2 and 190.5 plants (.) a(-1) (190.5 to 285.2 shoots (.) a(-1) with
   LAI of 1.69 to 2.13) and trained vertically. A second group of seedlings
   was planted at a density of 31.7 plants (.) a(-1) (63.5 shoots (.) a(-1)
   with a LAI <1) and trained horizontally.
   1. In both June-harvest and November- harvest cultures, fruit weight was
   closely related to total leaf area per plant in the vertical or
   horizontal trainings.
   2. Fruit weight in the vertically trained plants was significantly
   lighter than that in the horizontally trained ones even when the total
   leaf area was similar.
   3. The training method or the total leaf area per plant had little or no
   influence on the total soluble solids contents of the fruit.
   4. These results indicate that fruit weight of watermelon is basically
   determined by total leaf area per plant although some other factors
   (e.g. light interception characteristics) may be also involved.}},

Abstract = {{Lycopene, a carotenoid, has antioxidant properties that may reduce the
   incidence of certain cancers. Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb)
   Matsum \& Nakai) is a natural source of lycopene, with a reported
   average content of 48.7 mug g(-1) fresh weight based on samples taken
   from retail produce. This study demonstrated the variability of lycopene
   content in 11 red-fleshed watermelon cultivars grown at one location,
   representing seedless, open-pollinated and hybrid types, and in
   commercially shipped hybrid and seedless melons, representing seasonal
   production periods. Tristimulus colorimeter a{*} and chroma values were
   positively correlated with lycopene values, but Linear or quadratic
   regressions of colorimeter data against lycopene values were not
   significant. Tristimulus colorimeter readings from cut melons were
   compared to amounts of lycopene extracted from the same melons. Lycopene
   content varied widely among cultivars, with four cultivars having mean
   values greater than 65.0 mug g(-1) fresh weight. Seedless types sampled
   tended to have higher amounts of lycopene (> 50.0 mug g(-1) fresh

Abstract = {{We investigate sites of incompatibility for five Turnera L. species and
   for Piriqueta caroliniana (Walt.) Urban using aniline blue staining of
   pollen tubes and fluorescence microscopy. We show that sites of
   incompatibility occur in the stigma and upper regions of the style.
   There is an asymmetry between the morphs where, following selfing,
   pollen tubes tend to grow further into long-styled compared to
   short-styled plants, although the difference is not particularly marked.
   We demonstrate for the first time a qualitative difference in the
   appearance of pollen tubes. Upon self-pollination, pollen tubes in
   short-styled plants do not produce callose plugs, while all other
   pollinations result in callose plug formation. This could indicate that
   there is a difference in the mechanisms of incompatibility between the
   morphs. Exploiting crosses between two populations of Turnera scabra
   Millsp. that differ in flower size, we found no support for the
   hypothesis that incompatibility of long-styled plants is the result of
   insufficient nutrient reserves in pollen. Bud-pollinations provided
   limited support for the hypothesis that a short-specific style protein
   is involved in incompatibility. Crosses between distylous and
   homostylous species provided support for a recombinant origin for
   homostyly for four species, while deviations from this expectation were
   observed in four instances.}},

Abstract = {{`Muroto-Konatsu' and `Nishiuchi-Konatsu' are seedless bud mutants of
   Hyuganatsu (Citrus tamurana) which were examined for their bases of
   seedlessness.
   1. There were no significant differences in the numbers of ovules and
   locules per ovary among `Muroto - Konatsu', `Nishiuchi - Konatsu' and
   common type Hyuganatsu.
   2. When `Muroto - Konatsu', `Nishiuchi - Konatsu' and the common type
   were pollinated with pollen from `Suisho - Buntan' pummelo, the pollen
   tubes barely penetrated the pistil of `Muroto-Konatsu', whereas they
   grew down to the ovary of `Nishiuchi - Konatsu' and the common type.
   Bence,'Muroto - Konatsu' had a few fertilized ovules which failed to set
   seeds, whereas `Nishiuchi - Konatsu' and the common type had the same
   number of pollen tubes in the upper part of their ovaries 14 day after
   pollination and set an equal of fertilized ovules and seeds.
   3. Self-pollination and reciprocal pollination were performed in
   `Nishiuchi-Konatsu' and the common type. In self - pollinated `Nishiuchi
   - Konatsu', the pollen tubes penetrated into upper part of the ovary.
   Hence, a few fertilized ovules were produced. In reciprocal pollinated
   `Nishiuchi - Konatsu' and the common type and self-pollinated the common
   type, the pollen tubes penetrated only into middle part of the styles.
   Hence no fertilized ovules were produced.
   These data indicate that the seedlessness of `Muroto - Konatsu' results
   from the inhibition of pollen tube growth into the pistil when
   cross-pollinated, whereas in `Nishiuchi - Konatsu', which is partially
   self - compatible, it is nearly always seedless because of poor pollen
   growth when self- pollinated. We conclude that seedless cultivars
   `Muroto - Konatsu' and `Nishiuchi - Konatsu' mutated in the characters
   of the pistils on cross - compatible and self- incompatible,

   were esters and aldehydes that have already been demonstrated as
   flavor-related compounds in other products. All esters believed to have
   flavor impact increased progressively after pollination, and this trend
   continued with increasing harvest maturity. However, compound recovery
   often decreased when fruits were harvested over-ripe. Most aldehydes
   increased during early growth stages and then tapered off with
   increasing harvest maturity. The SPME method suitably recovered most
   compounds reported to impart characteristic flavor/aroma in muskmelons.

   When distance from the pollinizer row was 6.0 m or greater, triploid
   fruit numbers diminished substantially. Yield estimates made each year
   using the fruit density data suggested that a 1 pollinizer : 4 triploid
   ratio gave the maximum total triploid fruit yield per hectare for 1.5-m
   row spacings, These results should prove useful in designing field
   planting strategies to optimize triploid watermelon production.}},

Abstract = {{1. Bees are believed to be dominant pollen vectors in tropical forests,
   yet studies specific to bees in south-east Asia are rare. Regeneration
   and restoration of the rapidly disappearing lowland forests of this
   region are reliant on bees, thus there is an urgent need for forest bee
   data at the community level.
   2. Bee communities of eight forested sites in Johor (Malaysia) and
   Singapore were surveyed three times each from February to August 1999 at
   the below-canopy level. These sites ranged from relatively undisturbed
   primary lowland dipterocarp forests to late secondary forests and exotic
   forests, including an oil palm plantation. We attempted to elucidate the
   environmental factors that correlated with the distribution of bees.
   3. Bee abundance, in particular that of Apidae, was significantly higher
   in larger primary forests than other types of forests. However, bee
   species richness was higher in disturbed forests.
   4. The distribution of bees was apparently influenced by variables
   closely related to forest disturbance and resource abundance, such as
   the density of big trees (diameter at breast height 30-40 cm),
   temperature and flowering intensity of trees and shrubs.
   5. More stingless bees (Trigona spp.) were found where trees were larger
   and ambient conditions more constant but flowering intensities lower.
   6. The differences between the bee communities in forests of urban
   Singapore and primary forests in Johor may indicate that ecological
   processes in the forests of Singapore, in particular pollination, may be
   changing. However, pollination may not be totally intact in the primary
   forests surveyed, as their bee communities seemed to be depauperate.
   7. The role of important pollinators, especially bees, for the long-term
   survival of tropical lowland forests is poorly understood. Our study
   indicates that we urgently need more thorough understanding of
   pollination and pollinators, as some bee species appear to be
   disappearing from disturbed tropical lowland forests.}},

Abstract = {{To observe pollen tube behavior in the pistils of ten self-incompatible
   Citrus cultivars, bud pollination, delayed pollination, self-pollination
   and cross pollination were carried out. In self-pollination, of
   self-incompatible cultivars, pollen tubes were perfectly arrested in the
   stigmas and styles by 6 days after pollination, while in three
   self-compatible and 19 cross-compatible pollinations pollen tubes
   penetrated into the ovaries by 4 to 8 days after pollination. Various
   abnormal behavior and morphology of pollen tubes were observed in both
   incompatible and compatible pollinations, but were less common in the
   compatible ones. In the pistils of self-incompatible cultivars
   self-pollinated two days before anthesis and two days after anthesis,
   the self-incompatible pollen tubes ceased to grow in the stigmas and
   styles, while in the pistils self-pollinated 4 and 6 days before
   anthesis many pollen tubes reached the ovaries. However, numbers of
   pollen tubes penetrating the ovaries were different tit different
   cultivars. In the pistils of self-incompatible cultivars self-pollinated
   4 days after anthesis, pollen tube growth was enhanced to some extent,
   while in those self-pollinated 6 and 8 days after anthesis pollen tubes
   could not detected probably because of the degeneration of the styles.
   These studies suggested that in the pistil of self incompatible Citrus
   self-incompatibility initiates 6 days before anthesis and increases tip
   to the day of anthesis and that some of the cultivars have a common S
   allele that controls self-incompatibility.}},

Abstract = {{Despite being conspicuous and influential features of the biosphere,
   urban ecosystems have been neglected in ecological research. Arthropods
   are abundant in urban settings, but little is known about how these
   animals respond to urbanization. We systematically monitored the
   structure of ground arthropod communities for 12 months at 16 sites
   representing the four most abundant forms of urban land use
   (residential, industrial, agricultural, and desert remnant) in a rapidly
   growing metropolitan area (Phoenix, AZ). Although taxonomic richness was
   comparable among land-use types, community composition differed, with
   certain taxa being uniquely associated with each form of land use. Three
   taxa (springtails, ants, and mites) were extremely widespread and
   abundant, accounting for over 92\% of captures; when these three taxa
   were excluded from analysis, however, differences were revealed in
   arthropod community composition with urban land use. Trophic dynamics
   also varied with land use: predators, herbivores, and detritivores were
   most abundant in agricultural sites, while omnivores were equally
   abundant in all forms of land use. These community-level differences
   resulted from taxon-specific responses to habitat structure, which
   varied with land use. Because arthropod community structure is affected
   by habitat structure and land use, and because arthropods play key roles
   in nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, pollination, and soil
   aeration, the spatial heterogeneity of urban ecosystems therefore may
   affect ecosystem functioning. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to compare the airborne concentrations of

   Alnus, Betula) in the cities of Warsaw (central Poland), Lublin (eastern
   Poland) and Szczecin (western Poland) during the years 2000-2001.
   Measurements were performed by the volumetric method. Pollen seasons
   were defined as the periods in which 95\% of the total catch occurred.
   The highest concentration and annual pollen count of Con,his was
   measured in Lublin in both seasons, while the highest annual pollen
   counts of Alnus and Betula were noted in Warsaw, where the annual pollen
   count of Betula in 2001 was four times higher than in 2000 and equalled
   5,376 g-rains in m(3) per 24 h. Significant differences in the pollen
   count of the examined taxa were observed between two seasons: the pollen
   count of Corylus was higher in 2000 than in 2001, while for Alnus and
   Betula the opposite was the case. The longest pollen seasons were
   observed at low annual pollen counts for the pollen of Corylus. Results
   of the study reveal significant differences between the seasons and the
   cities. The differences concern the dates of the appearance of pollen
   grains in the air, the duration of the presence of sporomorphs and the
   maximum concentrations in particular seasons. The pollen counts of
   alder, birch and hazel trees are determined by the weather, diversity of
   local flora and specific rhythm of pollination of particular taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination of Plantago species in the Extremadura Region (SW of the
   Iberian Peninsula) was studied using three volumetric traps located in
   the cities of Badajoz, Merida and Caceres between 1994 and 1999.
   Variations in atmospheric concentration of Plantago pollen were analysed
   between locations, and annual, daily, and hourly Variations recorded for
   each location. The highest concentrations of pollen were recorded at
   Caceres, while the Merida and Badajoz values were similar. This is
   explained by the nature of the surroundings of each city. Interannual
   variations in pollination levels were significantly correlated with
   autumn rains, which determine the extent of development of the
   populations. The hourly patterns of pollen capture were well-defined and
   similar for all three study sites. Maximum levels were reached between
   1000 and 1200 h. Nocturnal concentrations were very low. Furthermore,
   this pattern was maintained throughout the flowering period, impling a
   very close link with the patterns of anthesis of the species. The three
   stations showed similar patterns of daily variation, which were
   significantly correlated with certain meteorological parameters. Pollen
   concentrations were affected positively by temperature, but negatively
   by relative humidity. The influence of wind direction also seemed to be
   explicable in these terms since the easterly winds, which are dry and
   hot in this region, had a positive influence, and the westerly winds
   which are moist and cool had a negative effect. The most relevant factor
   influencing levels of Plantago pollen in the atmosphere was wind speed,
   which was negatively correlated with pollen levels. (C) 2000 Annals of

Abstract = {{We compared the species richness and abundance of pollinator
   (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) communities in two seasons (September 1998 and
   April 1999) among four types of urban land use in the Phoenix, Arizona,
   USA, metropolitan area (xeriscaped residential yards, mesiscaped
   residential yards, urban desert-remnant parks, and natural desert parks
   on the fringe of the metropolitan area). Richness and abundance of bees
   were generally lower in residential areas than in desert areas, with
   desert areas on the fringe of the metro area possessing the highest
   diversity of all sites. Residential yards that utilized xeric
   landscaping had a more diverse bee community (with proportionally more
   rare species) than did mesic (turf grass) yards, particularly in late
   summer (September). Although bee community structure was apparently
   unaffected by the density of local habitat features (native and exotic
   trees, shrubs, cacti, and herbaceous plants in addition to human-built
   structures), the types of habitat features do appear to influence the
   number and types of bees present in an area. These results suggest that
   urban development can be designed to promote the conservation of bees.
   Specifically, preservation of desert and greater use of xeric
   landscaping rather than mesiscaping may help preserve this ecologically

Abstract = {{Watermelon plants were grown in 4 types of soilless culture
   systems-wet-sheet culture (WSC), rockwool culture (RWC), and deep-flow
   technique either with aeration (DFT/A) or without aeration (DFT/N)-to
   determine a suitable soilless culture system for watermelon. The
   electrical conductivity (EC) of the nutrient solution supplied was
   maintained at 1.2 dS m(-1). Shoots were restricted to 2 per plant and
   were trained vertically. Each plant had I fruit. Although shoot growth
   was greater in DFT at earlier growth stages, some plants wilted in DFT/N
   at the fruit development stage. Fruit weight was slightly greater in WSC
   and DFT/A than in RWC and DFT/N. The total soluble solids (TSS) content
   of the fruit was similar in WSC, RWC, and DFT/A. From these results, we
   selected WSC as a suitable soilless culture system for watermelon.
   The effect of salinity at the fruit development stage on fruit weight
   and TSS content was investigated in WSC to ascertain whether the quality
   of the fruit could be improved. The EC of the nutrient solution supplied
   was 1.2 dS m(-1) at the vegetative growth stage. It was then set to 1.2
   dS m(-1) (control), 5 or 8 dS m(-1) (salinity treatments) at 12-13 d
   after pollination. Fruits were harvested at 40 d after pollination. In
   the 5 and 8 dS m(-1) treatments, the EC of the nutrient solution in the

Abstract = {{The primary factor limiting the use of size controlling rootstocks in
   stone fruit production is the lack of availability of suitable
   rootstocks with a wide range of compatibility among cultivars. From 1986
   to 1994 we evaluated 80+ genotypes representing a broad range of genetic
   backgrounds for their rooting capacity, compatibility with peach
   (O'Henry) and plum (Santa Rosa), and size controlling characteristics.
   During 1990 and 1991 we identified 19 potential size controlling
   rootstock genotypes for peach. In February, 1996 a four-acre
   experimental rootstock trial was planted at the Kearney Agricultural
   Center to evaluate the potential of eight of these rootstocks compared
   to commercially available stocks. This experiment involves ten different
   rootstocks and two scions. The ten rootstocks are: Alace, Hiawatha,
   Sapalta (open pollinated seedlings of a Prunus besseyi x P. salicina
   hybrid), K145-5, K-146-43, K-146-44, P-30-135, (P. salicina x P. Persica
   hybrids) K-119-50 (P salicina x P. dulcis hybrid), Citation and
   Nemaguard. The two main scion cultivars are Loadel (an early clingstone
   processing cultivar) and Flavorcrest (an early fresh market freestone
   cultivar). Although three of the test rootstocks have exhibited some
   tree loss due to delayed incompatibility with selected scion cultivars,
   the results of the other scion/rootstock combinations have been
   positive. One rootstock (P-30-135) appears very promising with tree
   size/vigor approximately 70\% of Nemaguard and fruit size potential
   across a range of crop loads greater than or equal to all other tested
   rootstocks.}},

Abstract = {{In early 19th-century Moravia, breeders of animals and plants joined
   with other interested citizens in the Moravian and Silesian Agricultural
   Society to debate economic priorities. Several of the senior members had
   a profound influence upon breeding theory: J.K. Nestler, Professor of
   Natural History and Agriculture at the University of Olomouc, left a
   collection of influential writings. In the context of sheep breeding he
   defined `inheritance capacity' (Vererbungsfahigkeit), `hereditary
   history' (Vererbungsgeschichte) and `developmental history'
   (Entwicklungsgeschichte). His linking of the last two terms, as two
   sides of the same coin, puts Mendel's use of the second one in context.
   Professor F. Diebl taught the same topics as Nestler at the
   Philosophical Institute in Brno, with a bias towards plants. Diebl's
   lectures were attended by Mendel who gained top marks in three
   examinations. Diebl stressed the importance of artificial pollination to
   produce new varieties and recognised peas and beans as suitable subjects
   for the procedure. Prelate Cyrill Napp, abbot before Mendel, had a deep
   interest in heredity and how it was transmitted through both sexes. He
   generously supported Mendel's research. A happy blend of economic and
   academic influences, together with original talent and inner drive, led
   to Mendel's great discovery. (C) 2000 Academie des sciences/Editions

Title = {{Reproductive biology of the olive (Olea europaea L.) cultivar `Nabali
   Baladi'}},

Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{`Nabali Baladi' is the most common olive cultivar in Jordan. The final
   fruit set is very low, specially in orchards planted only with this
   cultivar. This problem is very common in olive cultivars. Thus, the
   investigations focused on the development and the morphology of the
   reproductive organs: pollen grain quality and quantity, pollen
   germination and pollen tube growth, fertilisation and fruit set. Another
   two olive cultivars `Grossa de Spagna' and `Rasie' were used for
   cross-pollination.
   One month before anthesis, the two tetrasporangiate anthers were
   developed. About three weeks before anthesis, the microspore mother
   cells were observed clearly. Through a week, they developed to the
   microspore tetrade stage. Finally, the fully developed pollen grains
   could be observed about five days before anthesis.
   The pollen grain number of the pollinizers was higher than in `Nabali
   Baladi'. The normal pollen grains were more than 82\% for the three
   cultivars in both years. The pollen viability was tested on an agar
   medium 0,8\%, containing 10\% sucrose and 50 ppm citric acid. Immersion
   of the pollen grains in olive oil before spreading them on the medium
   improved this test significantly.
   The pistil consists of a superior ovary, short style, and wet papillate
   stigma. It was developed about six days before anthesis. A protuberance
   structure arised from the placenta of the ovary about four weeks before
   anthesis which developed to the anatropous ovule. Each carpel contained
   two ovules and only one ovule developed to the seed. The first embryo
   sac mother cell could be recognised in the middle of the ovule about two
   weeks before anthesis. The embryo sac with eight nuclei was completed
   about two days before anthesis. The pollen tubes grew intercellularly
   through the stigma and the transmitting tissue in the style. One pollen
   tube entered the ovary to fertilise one ovule through the micropyle.
   The stigmas with a high pollen grain number had also a high number of
   germinated pollen grains. The flowers which had less than ten germinated
   pollen grains on the stigma had low percentage of fertilised ovaries. In
   most of self-pollinated flowers, all germinated pollen grains could not
   penetrate the transmitting tissue in the style, while in open-and
   cross-pollination, most of the flowers had germinated pollen grains, and
   the tubes grew through the transmitting tissue in the style. In open and
   cross-pollination, the pollen tubes started to enter the ovules two to
   three days before in self-pollination. In addition to that, the
   percentage of the fertilised ovules in open- and cross-pollination was
   about three times higher than in self-pollination.
   One week after anthesis, there was no difference in length between the
   fertilised and the non-fertilised ovules. Two weeks after anthesis, the
   ovule length doubled and the non-fertilised ovules degenerated. From the
   third week till the seventh week after anthesis, the ovule grew almost
   logarithmically. Eight weeks after anthesis till the mature stage, there
   was no further increase in the ovule size.
   The nuclear endosperm started to develop five days after anthesis. It
   became cellular 15 days after anthesis. The absorption of the nucellus
   tissue and the endosperm was very clear during the embryo development.
   The zygote was observed nine days after anthesis. Four and five weeks
   after anthesis, it developed to a long narrow suspensor. Six weeks after
   anthesis, the embryo reached the globular stage. One week later, it
   started to develop two cotyledons (heart-shaped) which developed quickly
   to the full length 12 weeks after anthesis. Finally, the embryo and the
   partly absorbed endosperm reached the final stage about 22 weeks after
   anthesis.
   The perfect flowers abscised in two ways: the non-fertilised perfect
   flowers abscised through the second week after anthesis, and part of the
   fertilised flowers abscised from two to six weeks after anthesis. After
   that, there was no significant fruit drop. The fruit set in open-and
   cross-pollination was significantly higher than in self-pollination.
   According to these results,'Nabali Baladi' can be considered as a
   partial self-compatible cultivar. Its self-incompatibility is
   gametophytic. Therefore, in `Nabali Baladi' orchards, two other
   pollinizers are recommended. `Rasic' and `Grossa de Spagna' are good
   pollinizers for `Nabali Baladi'. In old `Nabali Baladi' orchards, it is
   recommended to graft the olive trees with at least two pollinizers.}},

Abstract = {{The yellow pitcher plant. Sarracenia flava, is an insectivorous plant
   restricted to fire-maintained wetland ecosystems in southeastern
   Virginia. Only four natural sites remain in the state totaling fewer
   than 100 clumps. Plant, from sites located in Dinwiddie, Grecnsville,
   Prince George, Sussex counties, and the city of Suffolk: were tested for
   the effects of self-pollination, intrasite outcrossing, and intersite
   outcrossing on offspring quantity (total seed number and total seed
   mass) and offspring quality (avarage seed mass, germination, and
   growth).
   Self-pollination resulted in significantly lower offspring quantity and
   quality. Total seed number and total seed mass for self-pollinated
   capsules were approximately one-fourth that of outcrossed capsules.
   Germination, survivorship, and growth over 5 yr were also significantly
   lower for offspring from self-pollinated capsules. Together, these
   results suggest strong inbreeding depression in this species.
   Relative to offspring from intrasite crosses, offspring from intersite
   crosses were significantly larger after 5 yr of growth. This suggests
   that restoration efforts for Virginia S. flava will be most successful
   when plants from multiple sites are used.}},

   studied. We also observed the effect of soft-X-rays on pollen
   germination and elongation of the pollen tube. The germination rates of
   pollen treated with 1000 to 2000 Gy of soft- X- ray were almost the same
   as those of the control, whereas the rate was significantly reduced at
   3000 Gy. Soft- X- irradiated pollen germinated on a stigma, and the
   pollen tube elongated in the embryo sac. Watermelon fruit pollinated
   with pollen irradiated with 800 Gy of soft- X- ray had no normal seeds
   but only empty ones. To delineate the varietal differences by the number
   of empty seeds and seed size in seedless fruit, wild types, Japanese,
   Chinese, and American watermelon cultivars were investigated. The number
   and size of empty seeds varied among cultivars. A low correlation
   (r=0.272) existed between the total number of seeds in the control fruit
   and the number of empty seeds in the seedless fruit. Whereas, a high
   correlation (seed length: r = 0.943, P < 0.001, seed width: r= 0.883, P<

Abstract = {{As part of a mandarin genetic breeding programme in Southern Brazil
   cytogenetic studies of meiotic behaviour and estimations of pollen
   fertility were performed in an open-pollinated population of `Lee'
   mandarin {[}Citrus clementina x (C. paradisi x C. tangerina)]. For
   meiotic and pollen staining analysis flower buds and flowers in anthesis
   were, respectively, examined. In most plants microsporogenesis was
   regular, with meiotic indexes over 90.0\% and pollen viability over
   83.0\%. We observed meiotic abnormalities including univalents and
   stickiness in metaphase I, laggards and bridges in anaphase and
   telophase I and II and microcytes at the tetrad stage. Dyads and triads
   were found in two plants (112 and 122) at the end of microsporogenesis,
   suggesting production of unreduced gametes. These plants had a low
   pollen viability (22.9 and 24.4\%, respectively) probably due to
   observed meiotic irregularities. One plant (223) presented pollen grains
   with a different shape and bigger size, possibly unreduced. Plants 112
   and 122 were monoembryonic and plant 223 polyembryonic with 3.5 embryos
   per seed. The potential fertilization ability of the pollen grains was
   estimated by in vitro germination tests. Pollen germination was
   generally high, up to 91.5\%, but eight plants (039, 050, 072, 081, 087,
   112, 122 and 126) had pollen germination of less than 59\%. We conclude
   that most plants have the ability to produce viable gametes and could be
   used as pollen donors in programmed crosses. The monoembryonic
   unreduced-gamete producer plants 112 and 122 are potential progenitors
   in crosses aimed at producing triploid seedless fruits. (C) 2000

   quadrants: 1 (NE), 2 (SE), 3 (SW) and 4 (NW). The pollen source
   distribution allowed 16 pollen types to be analysed as a function of
   their distribution in the four quadrants with respect to the location of
   the trap. Four of them correspond to species growing in an irrigated
   farmland environment (Amaranthaceae-Chenopodiaceae, Plantago, Scirpus,
   and Typha), five to riparian and woodland species (Salix, Fraxinus,
   Alnus, Populus, and Eucalyptus), four to urban ornamentals (Ulmus,
   Arecaceae, Cupressaceae, and Casuarina), and three which include the
   most frequent pollen grains of widely distributed species (Poaceae,
   Quercus, and Olea). The results show that the distribution of the
   sources and the wind direction play a very major role in determining the
   pollen concentration in the atmosphere when these sources are located in
   certain quadrants, and that the widely distributed pollen sources show
   no relationship with wind direction. In some years the values of the
   correlations were not maintained, which leads one to presume that, in
   order to draw significant conclusions and establish clear patterns of
   the influence of wind direction, a continuous and more prolonged study
   will be required.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for producing seedless watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) in
   diploid plants using soft-X-irradiated pollen is described. Fruit set at
   almost the same rate despite soft-X-irradiation. Empty seeds were
   produced in the watermelon cultivars `Benikodama' and `Fujihikari TR'
   following hand pollination using soft-X-irradiated pollen.
   Soft-X-irradiation doses of 800-1000 Gy resulted in small empty seeds in
   `Fujihikari TR', whereas 400-1000 Gy doses gave the best results for
   `Benikodama', although empty seeds in the latter were many and
   conspicuous. Soft-X-ray treatments did not affect fruit weight, shape,
   rind thickness or days to maturation compared to controls. However,
   female flowers treated with soft-X-irradiated pollen produced fruits
   with slightly higher sugar content compared to controls in `Benikodama'.
   Therefore, this new method is an effective technique to produce seedless
   watermelon. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Filipendula vulgaris is a characteristic species of dry nonacidic
   grasslands in Denmark. This habitat type occurs only on marginal areas
   not suitable for agriculture or urbanization and that are by their
   nature fragmented. The population genetic structure of F. vulgaris was
   investigated in 17 populations within two regions of Denmark, using
   isozyme electrophoresis. Small populations were found to have
   significantly fewer polymorphic loci than larger populations, but all
   populations maintained the same common allelic variants. The degree of
   isolation of individual populations did not affect the amount of genetic
   variation. Offspring arrays revealed a very high outcrossing rate
   (0.96). The field study demonstrated a very high level of gene flow
   between populations considering that small insects are thought to be the
   main pollinators of this species. An experiment to verify whether pollen
   transport by wind could explain the results from the field study
   demonstrated long-distance transport from isolated plants to bagged
   plants. Filipendula vulgaris pollen grains are very small and this
   explains why outcrossed progeny were found using pollination bags with
   small pore sizes. We conclude that wind pollination is indeed possible
   and together with insect pollination is causing the observed patterns of
   genetic variation. The substantial gene flow between populations may be
   reducing the effects of genetic drift in the small fragmented
   populations of F. vulgaris.}},

Abstract = {{The Pinus genus has an elevated pollen production and an anemophilous
   nature. Although considered to be hypoallergenic, numerous cases of
   allergies caused by Pinus pollen have been cited and different authors
   believe that its allergenicity should be studied in more depth. In the
   city of Vigo several patients have tested positive for Pinus pollen
   extracts in skin tests, some of them being mono-sensitive to such
   pollens.
   In order to ascertain the behaviour of Pinus pollen and its correlation
   to the main meteorological factors, we carried out an aerobiological
   study in the city of Vigo from 1995 to 1998 by using a Hirst
   active-impact volumetric sporetrap, model Lanzoni VPPS 2000, placed on
   the left bank of the Vigo estuary (42 degrees 14'15{''}N, 8 degrees
   43'30{''}W). Pinus has high quantitative importance in the airborne
   pollen spectrum of the city. It is one of the best represented taxa
   constituting 13\%-20\% of the total annual pollen levels. The quantity
   of Pinus pollen present in the atmosphere of the city of Vigo throughout
   a year is 5751 grains (as the average for the sampled years), with a
   very long pollination period, from the middle of January until May. The
   maximum concentration was recorded in 1998 with 1105 grains/m(3) on 3
   March, a much greater value than those for the previous years. At the
   end of its pollination period there is usually a final increase in Pinus
   pollen concentrations coinciding with the pollination of Pinus
   silvestris, which are more abundant in mountainous areas far from the

Abstract = {{Containerized production of triploid watermelon transplants is essential
   because of the special conditions required for seed germination,
   emergence, and early plant development not found in open-field
   situations. Furthermore, the extra cost of seedling production is
   justified because triploid watermelon seeds costs are six times greater
   than those of diploid hybrid seeds and 60 times greater than
   open-pollinated diploid watermelon seeds. An abbreviated protocol for
   triploid watermelon transplant production follows: Excellent
   containerized plants are produced in 30 to 50 cm(3) cells containing a
   sterile mix of 50 to 85\% high grade peat and 35 to 50\% horticultural
   vermiculite or horticultural perlite amended with lime, fertilizers and
   a wetting agent. Thiram or other approved fungicides should be applied
   to the seed before planting.
   One seed per cell should be planted about 2-cm deep with the radicle
   (pointed end) up to reduce seedcoat adherence to the cotyledons. The
   tray is watered lightly to bring the seed and mix in contact. Stacked
   trays should be covered with polyethylene and placed in a germination
   chamber at 30-35 C for about two days or until radicles are visible in
   the cell drainage holes. The trays are then arranged on benches in a
   greenhouse with day temperature 21-27C and night temperature 18-21C
   where temperature control can be achieved. Plants are fertilized every
   three days with a solution containing 50 mg.l(-1) N from Ca(NO3)(2) and
   KNO3 from cotyledon expansion until the first true leaf is fully
   expanded, then with a 200 mg.l(-1) N solution applied every other day
   until the second true leaf is fully expanded, finally the fertilizer is
   reduced for several days before transplanting to the field. Plants are
   ready for transplanting when the roots are sufficiently developed to
   permit removal from the cell with the entire growing mix volume intact.
   This will require three to five weeks depending on cell size and growing
   conditions. Using these production methods, transplant return efficiency
   has been obtained from trial data since 1990 for ten varieties grown in
   at least five of eight years. The overall average transplant return was
   79\% with a range of 69\% for `Tiffany' to 89\% for `Queen of Hearts'.}},

Abstract = {{The frost tolerance of seedlings of spotted gums representing four
   closely related species; Corymbia maculata (seven provenances), C.
   variegata (six provenances), C. henryi (one provenance) and C.
   citriodora (two provenances) was examined. Each provenance of C.
   maculata, C. variegata and C. henryi was represented by 10 seedlings
   from each of eight open-pollinated families, while the two C. citriodora
   provenances were each represented by 40 seedlings from a provenance bulk
   seedlot. Excised leaf discs from seedlings hardened by exposure to the
   Canberra winter were subjected to test temperatures of 4.2, 6.1 and -8.0
   degrees C. Damage to the discs was estimated by the electrical
   conductivity of leachate produced by soaking the disks in water after
   exposure to freezing temperatures.
   Exposure to -6.1 degrees C for 1 h produced leachate conductivities
   corresponding to 37\% of discs receiving lethal injury and gave good
   discrimination between tolerant and susceptible material. There were
   significant differences in frost tolerance between species, provenances
   within species, and between open-pollinated families within provenances.
   Corymbia variegata displayed significantly greater frost tolerance than
   the other three species. Species rankings were consistent across the
   three test temperatures. Inland, high altitude provenances of C.
   variegata and C. maculata had greater frost tolerance than those from
   lowland coastal locations, while there were no consistent trends of
   frost tolerance with latitude in these species.
   Analysis of seedling morphological characters effectively separated the
   different species in a manner consistent with the taxonomic review by
   Hill and Johnson (1995). Characters which separated C. maculata and C.
   variegata included the leaf pair at which the changeover from juvenile
   to intermediate leaf morphology occurred and the degree of pubescence of
   the leaves and stem, leaf size and shape. Corymbia variegata and the
   southern provenance of C. citriodora were separated only by the
   citronella scent of C. citriodora, the northern C. citriodora provenance
   had distinctly different leaf size and shape. Corymbia henryi seedlings
   had greater stem and leaf pubescence than those of C. maculata as well
   as distinctly shaped leaves, characterised by having the greatest length
   from the widest point to the leaf base.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the literature concerning digestion and nutrient
   content of pollen. Four topics are addressed in detail: 1) The mechanism

   differences in pollen wall porosity, thickness, and composition.
   Although hummingbirds reportedly digest pollen very poorly, most animals
   studied, including those that do not regularly consume pollen, can
   digest 50-100\% of ingested grains. Overlooked and recent research of
   pollen protein content shows that pollen grains may contain over 60\%

Abstract = {{Seedlessness is a desirable trait in Citrus. We are using conventional
   breeding methods and molecular techniques to generate new seedless
   varieties for the Australian citrus industry. Amongst the conventional
   breeding strategies, diploid hybridisation relies on parents that will
   transmit parthenocarpic ability, male/female sterility, and pollen
   incompatibility. Candidate genes to achieve seedless fruit using
   molecular techniques include those that induce fruit formation in the
   absence of fertilisation (parthenocarpy), and genes that directly target
   seed destruction after fertilisation to leave an imperceptible residue.
   Parthenocarpy occurs naturally in navel orange and Satsuma mandarin but
   it is not known how it is initiated and controlled at the molecular
   level. We are using Arabidopsis to study parthenocarpic fruit formation.
   An Arabidopsis mutant, fruit without fertilisation (fwf), has been
   identified that forms a seedless fruit (silique) in the absence of
   pollination. The ovules degenerate in parthenocarpic fwf fruit, and
   fruit size approaches that of a seeded silique. The fwf fruit forms all
   of the fruit tissues observed in seeded siliques. It shatters open at
   maturity, indicating that the seedless fruit matures normally. It is a
   recessive mutation for which the chromosomal location is known and gene
   cloning is in progress. Some Citrus cultivars that are normally seedy
   can set seedless fruit if pollination is prevented. In such cultivars,
   seeded fruits are often produced because insect-mediated pollination is
   difficult to avoid. Introduction of a male sterility gene that prevents
   fertile pollen formation should allow parthenocarpic fruit formation. We
   have introduced a male sterility gene into West Indian lime. We have
   also constructed genes that inhibit seed formation in Arabidopsis and
   tobacco soon after fertilisation and the initiation of seed development.
   This was done because it is not yet possible to control parthenocarpy
   effectively, Not all Citrus cultivars possess a parthenocarpic ability,
   and male-sterile plants are still capable of being cross-pollinated and
   thus subjected to seed set. The constructs target destruction of various
   seed tissues early in development, resulting in minimal seed development
   that leaves behind a soft trace of seed in the fruit. We have observed
   that in different seed types specific tissues need to be targeted in
   order to reduce seed size effectively. These genes are also being
   evaluated in West Indian lime. We are awaiting flowering and fruit set
   to evaluate the efficacy of their action.
   Improvement of Citrus in Australia using gene biotechnology began in
   1992, and the first transgenic West Indian lime plants containing marker
   genes were regenerated in 1996. Transgenic plant lines containing the
   developed genes have since been generated and individual lines are being
   mass propagated for use in field trials under the guidelines of the
   Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC).
   Our molecular work complements our hybridisation strategies for
   seedlessness and forms part of the Australian national Citrus breeding
   and evaluation program supported with funds from the Australian citrus
   industry via levies collected from growers.}},

Abstract = {{yConventional citrus breeding faces many obstacles such as a prolonged
   period of juvenility, as well as incompatibility and polyembryony.
   Little published information is available on inheritance of juvenility,
   self-incompatibility, or parthenocarpy. Satsuma mandarin, known to
   possess obligatory parthenocarpy, was crossed with 20 different
   cultivars. Zygotic hybrids were grown in an insect-proof screen house.
   The procedure employed - induction of root restriction, removal of
   lateral shoots, limb bending, and optimum fertigation - resulted in an
   apparent reduction in the duration of the juvenile period. Chances of
   cross-pollination were very slight. Data on age of flowering, pollen
   fertility, fruit set, and number of seeds per fruit were analyzed. The
   genetic analyses of the different populations point to the possibility
   of polygenic inheritance of juvenility, support the self-incompatibility
   model proposed by Soost (1965, 1969), and suggest that the S allele of
   Satsuma differs from the two S alleles of Ellendale and one of the S
   alleles of Clementine. In addition, we suggest that obligatory
   parthenocarpy in Citrus depends on three dominant complementary genes.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorfenapyr was synthesised by American Cyanamid following isolation of
   a toxin from the Streptomyces fumanus actinomycete bacterium in 1985. As
   an insecticidelacaricide, it is primarily active by ingestion against a
   wide range of fruit pests including leaf rollers, leaf miners,
   leafhoppers, Tetranychus mites and thrips under both glasshouse and
   field conditions. With a novel mode of action, chlorfenayr is active
   against known resistant insect and mite strains.
   When evaluated under worst case laboratory conditions, chlorfenapyr was
   ``harmful{''} to several beneficials. An increased level of selectivity
   was observed when it was evaluated under semi-field conditions but toxic
   effects were still observed. However, when the selectivity of
   chlorfenapyr was evaluated under typical field conditions, it was found
   to be ``safe{''} to most beneficials, Chlorfenapyr was also found to be
   safe to the bumble bee pollinator, Bombus terrestris when introduced as
   early as two hours after application.
   Transient side-effects were observed on predatory mites (Typhlodromus
   pyri) with recovery taking place from two to four weeks after
   application. By contrast, chlorfenapyr was found to be safe to predatory
   mites of the genus Amblysieus under some, but not all conditions. In
   situations where Typhlodromus pyri or other sensitive species are
   important components of IPM programmes, it is recommended that
   chlorfenapyr should be used as a single application early in the season,
   thus combining achieving pest control at a time when predatory mite
   populations are able to make a full recovery.
   With a novel mode of action and selectivity to beneficials, chlorfenapyr
   is an important new IPM compatible resistance management tool for fruit
   production.}},

   and hence can be considered a practical alternative to the others. The
   data for the stomata in the haploids were length, 17-18 mu m; diameter,

   growth with the first stage of the flesh growth, and a second stage of
   flesh growth. Fruit composition was analysed for the concentrations of
   sucrose, reducing sugars, malic and citric acids in the flesh. The
   variability of growth and composition within each combination was high.
   The variation of composition was mainly related to the variation of
   growth during the second phase, although the fruit having largest
   diameters at thinning were often those with the highest citric acid
   concentration. Fruits growing intensively during the second phase had
   the highest sucrose and malic acid concentration and the lowest reducing

   0.9\% dry wt which is close to the caffeine content of the Arabica

Abstract = {{Yucca filamentosa and its species-specific pollinator, the yucca moth,
   Tegeticula yuccasella (Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae), form a relationship
   that is often cited as a classic example of a coevolved plant-pollinator
   mutualism. Observations of the moth's behavior have led to predictions
   that moth dispersal is relatively limited and that, as a consequence,
   the self-compatible Y. filamentosa should experience relatively high
   rates of self-fertilization, In contrast, analyses of its mating system
   indicated that Y. filamentosa was predominantly outcrossed. To better
   understand effective breeding patterns in Y. filamentosa populations, 10
   polymorphic allozyme loci were investigated to analyze the breeding
   structure of a natural Y. filamentosa population. Analyses revealed that
   Y. filamentosa is predominantly outcrossed, has multiply sired fruits,
   and that each fruit was sired by a different set of pollen donors. The
   effective number of pollen donors per fruit ranged from 1.56 to 3.13,
   indicating that some correlated mating exists within fruits. Paternity
   analyses revealed that pollen moved from 6 m to 293 m (mean = 118 m)
   within the study population and that a minimum of 10\% of the progeny
   were sired by pollen originating outside of the population. These
   results are discussed in the context of the yucca-yucca moth mutualism.}},

Abstract = {{Fruit and seed set in insect-pollinated agricultural crops rely
   primarily on honeybees because of their ease of management and
   transportation. In many fruit and vegetable crops, the number of bee
   visitations can be the limiting step in obtaining optimal yield.
   Increasing the attractiveness of flowers to honeybees could, therefore,
   provide a useful means of improving fruit yield and seed production.
   Genetic variability in attractiveness to honeybees was found within the
   genus Citrullus. The number of daily visits per flower ranged from six
   to 12 among cultivars, Moreover, most of the visits to the more
   attractive cultivars occurred in the first hour of bee activity, whereas
   visits to the less attractive cultivars started later in the morning. A
   positive relationship was found between the frequency of bee visitations
   and seed number per fruit. Analyses of floral attributes indicated no
   genetic variability in flower size, amount of pollen grains, or nectar
   volume; however, differences were observed in the concentration of
   sucrose and total sugars in the nectar, A positive relationship was
   found between attractiveness to bees and nectar sugar concentration,
   suggesting that this characteristic is one of the parameters responsible
   for variability in attractiveness to honeybees.}},

Abstract = {{Data on succession were collected from 15 seres starting on bare ground
   in man-made habitats (i.e. sites disturbed by various mining activities,
   bulldozed sites, ruderal urban sites, the exposed bottom of a destroyed
   water reservoir, and abandoned fields), all in the western part of the
   Czech Republic, Central Europe. The period for which the data on
   succession were available ranged from 12 to 60 yr. 56 species reaching
   dominance in some period of succession were selected (the criterion
   being: at least 25\% cover in at least one year in any sere); they were
   compared for biological and ecological traits with other species
   participating in the seres (167 species with at least 25\% cover in at
   least one year in any sere), and with the Central European flora as a
   whole. Significant differences between the species dominating in
   succession and others were found for the following traits: life form,
   life strategy, pollination mode, and ability of lateral spread. Dominant
   species differed from the regional flora in distribution of life
   strategies, pollination mode and immigration status. The results suggest
   that an `ideal successional dominant' is a tall, wind-pollinated plant,
   often a geophyte capable of intensive lateral spread, requiring high
   nutrient supply and sufficient site moisture. The set of traits
   contributing to achieving dominance by a species in human-made habitats
   includes both features occurring independently of phylogenies (life
   strategy, pollination mode, plant height, moisture demands) and those
   which dominant species probably share due to their common ancestors
   (nutrient demands, capability of extensive lateral spread).}},

Abstract = {{Seedling growth of `Mudeungsan' watermelon on rockwool was evaluated to
   be better in the order of 1>2 greater than or equal to 1/2>1/4
   strength(X) of ``Enshi{''} nutrient solution in terms of plant height,
   number of leaves, and leaf area. Overall plant growth was better in the
   order of 3/2>1>1/2X of ``Enshi{''} nutrient solution in terms of plant
   height, number of leaves, stem diameter, leaf length, and leaf width at
   fruit development stage. This indicates that the interaction between
   nutrient concentrations at the seedling stage and main growth stage was
   highly significant.
   The uptake of nutrients was high in the order of 3/2>1>1/2X nutrient
   solutions but water uptake was high in the order of 1/2>1>3/2X. The
   fruit quality was best in Ix and worst in half-strength (1/2X) solution.
   In all cases water uptake increased substantially i.e. up to 3 liters in
   10 days after transplanting. The nutrient solution uptake per plant
   which was 2 to 3 liters at the pollination stage, increased to 3 to 5
   liters in 7 to 10 days after pollination, and then decreased to 1 to 2
   liters 10 days after pollination. Water uptake decreased slowly as the
   ionic strength of the nutrient solution increased, this was also
   influenced by climatic conditions. In both slab and drainage the pH
   value of the nutrient solution rose to 7 to 8 after 10 days of
   pollination from the initial pH of 6 to 7, but dropped down to 5 to 6
   again at the time of harvest. In conclusion, the optimal nutrient
   concentration for culturing `Mudeungsan' watermelon was determined as 1
   to 2X of ``Enshi{''} nutrient solution when raising seedlings, and 1 to
   2/3X until pollination after transplanting, and 1/2X from pollination to
   harvest in the main culture beds.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of pollen source on fruit set and fruit quality
   characteristics (xenia effects) were examined in three commercial
   cultivars of mandarin, Imperial, Ellenor, and Murcott. Six trees of each
   cultivar received six pollination treatments: three cross-pollen
   sources, self-pollination, bagging and bagging with emasculation. Pollen
   tube growth, percentage fruit set, fruit weight, seediness, sugar and
   acid content were assessed in all treatments. Significant xenia effects,
   including effects on sugar content, were found in all cultivars.
   `Imperial' was found to be self-incompatible as self-pollen tubes were
   inhibited in the upper style. This resulted in a lower fruit set in
   self-pollinated fruits (P<0.01), a very low fruit weight (33-55 g,
   compared with 92-103 g, P<0.01), and fruits containing few or no seeds.
   In addition, `Ellenor' and `Murcott' pollen significantly increased
   sugar content of fruit by between 0.9-1.6\% compared with
   self-pollinated and unpollinated treatments (P<0.05). Widespread
   problems of variable production and poor fruit quality in `Imperial' may
   be alleviated by interplanting with appropriate pollen sources such as
   `Ellenor' and `Murcott'. Pollen source significantly affected fruit set,
   seed number and sugar content but not fruit weight of cv. Ellenor. In
   particular, `Murcott' pollen produced a significantly higher fruit set,
   relatively low seed number, and the highest mean sugar content (13.2\%),
   significantly higher than `Imperial' pollen, bagged, and unpollinated
   treatments (>12.5\%, P<0.01). Fruit production, seediness and sugar
   content of `Ellenor' mandarin may be improved by interplanting with
   `Murcott'. Cross-pollination significantly increased seed number of
   `Murcott' (15-21 seeds per fruit, compared with 13-17 seeds per fruit,
   P<0.01). `Murcott' could be planted in pure blocks since self-pollinated
   `Murcott' fruit had slightly fewer seeds than crosses, without any
   significant loss of size or quality. These results demonstrate the need
   for careful consideration of interplanting of cultivars and management
   of pollinators such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera L. to maximize fruit
   production and quality in mandarins.}},

   UV light. Leaves from in vitro shoot-tip cultures of known diploid

   shoots regenerated from cotyledon explants of the diploid cultivar
   Minilee. Approximately 11\% of the 188 regenerated shoots were
   classified as tetraploid during in vitro culture. Putative tetraploids
   were transplanted to the field and self-pollinated. About 45\% of
   tetraploids identified in vitro produced fruit and viable seed.
   Chloroplast counts of R-1 progeny were used to confirm their ploidy. All

Abstract = {{We studied a population of the distylous Palicourea padifolia
   (Rubiaceae) in a cloud forest remnant near Xalapa City, Veracruz, Mexico
   to explore possible asymmetries between floral morphs in the
   attractiveness to pollinators, seed dispersers, nectar robbers, floral
   parasites, and herbivores. We first assessed heterostyly and reciprocal
   herkogamy by measuring floral attributes such as corolla length (buds
   and open flowers), style and anther heights, stigma and stamen lengths
   and the distance between the anther tip to the stigma lobe. We then
   estimated floral and fruit attributes such as flower size, anther
   height, number and size of pollen grains, fruit size, seed size, nectar
   production, and flower and fruit standing crops to assess differences
   between floral morphs in attracting and effectively using mutualistic
   pollinators and seed dispersers. Also, floral parasitism and nectar
   robbing were assessed in this study as a measure of flower
   attractiveness to antagonists. The system seems to conform well to
   classical heterostyly (e.g. reciprocal stamen/style lengths, pollen and
   anther dimorphism, intramorph incompatibility) yet, there were several
   tantalizing differences observed between pin and thrum morphs. Thrum
   flowers have longer corollas and larger but fewer pollen grains than pin
   flowers. Both morphs produced the same total number of inflorescences,
   developed the same-number of buds, and opened the same number of flowers
   per inflorescence during the flowering season. Nectar production and
   sugar concentration were similar between floral morphs but the reward
   was not offered symmetrically to floral visitors throughout the day.
   Nectar concentration was higher in pin flowers in the afternoon. The
   numbers of developing, fully developed, and ripe fruits were the same
   between floral morphs, however, fruits and seeds were larger than those
   of thrums. The incidence of fly larvae was higher among thrum flowers
   and damage by nectar robbing was the same between floral morphs. Fruit
   abortion patterns of flowers manually pollinated suggest intra-morph
   sterility (self and intramorph incompatibility). There were no
   differences between morphs in fruit and seed set per flower following
   legitimate pollination although thrums were more leaky than the pins
   (intramorph compatibility).}},

Abstract = {{In the absence of wounding, the epidermis is only rarely involved in
   cell or organ fusion events; in fact, intact epidermal layers prevent
   graft unions. In Zea mays L, the mutation adherent (ad1) shows abnormal
   fusions between cells and organs. Fusions involve epidermal cells of
   vegetative and floral organs and occur early in the ontogeny of organs.
   Even so, epidermal cell types differentiate normally in the fused
   regions and internal tissue identities are maintained. In contrast, the
   extracellular matrix (cell wall and cuticle) of the epidermal cells is
   perturbed. Epidermal cell walls in adherent leaves are thicker than
   normal. Epicuticular wax particles appear reduced in size and number and
   altered in shape in mutant leaves. In addition, the outer epidermal cell
   walls of adherent leaves fluoresce when stained with aniline blue, a
   reagent that binds to callose. Immune localizations to specific cell
   wall epitopes suggest that pectins but nut arabinogalactans may have a
   role in the fusion events. Taken together, these results suggest that
   the ad1 mutation results in cell-wall and epicuticular-wax defects
   similar to responses seen in wounding, pollination by incompatible
   pollen, or pathogen attack. Since cell wall components and epicuticular
   waxes are extracellular secreted products, the ad1 mutation may disrupt
   normal functioning and/or composition of the secretory pathway and its
   cargo.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bee pollinated Chamaecrista fasciculata provides pollen as the
   sole reward to its pollinators. Male sterility, expressed as an absence
   or nearly complete absence of pollen production, occurs in low frequency
   in populations of C. fasciculata. Here we describe experiments, using C.
   fasciculata, to examine frequently cited determinants of the spread and
   maintenance of male sterility: compensation and the genetic basis of
   male sterility. In addition, we examine the role the pollination system
   plays in determining the reproductive success of the male steriles.
   Seventeen populations in Maryland, Illinois, and Kansas were surveyed
   and found to range from 0 to 6\% male sterility per population. An
   artificial population of male-sterile simulants and hermaphrodites was
   created to examine how the local frequency of nonrewarding male steriles
   might affect male-sterile female reproductive success. Male steriles
   performed equally poorly, with respect to seed production, whether
   surrounded by other male-sterile simulants or hermaphrodites.
   Compensation was examined by comparison of male steriles and
   hermaphrodites with respect to several reproductive and nonreproductive
   characters. Male steriles outperformed hermaphrodites in terms of
   nonreproductive biomass, but performed equally in terms of ovule number
   and produced many fewer flowers. The genetic basis of male sterility was
   examined by performing both intra- and interpopulational crosses of male
   steriles to hermaphrodites and indicate that male sterility is not
   purely cytoplasmic. The low frequency of male sterility in C.
   fasciculata populations may reflect reduced female reproductive success
   because of pollinator avoidance, lack of reproductive compensation, and
   a mode of inheritance that is not purely cytoplasmic.}},

Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{Starch gelatinization and retrogradation properties of corn were studied
   to determine the effect of controlled (self) pollination versus
   noncontrolled pollination on analytical determinations, and the
   potential to eliminate the expensive and time-consuming step of
   self-pollinating before research screening of corn genotypes.
   Twenty-four hybrids were grown in two Iowa locations, Story City and
   Ames. At Story City, all hybrids received three pollination treatments:
   self-pollination; small-plot, open-pollination (representing corn from
   small test plots); and large-plot, open-pollination (representing corn
   from a farmer's field). Self-pollinated and small-plot, open-pollinated
   corn were grown in replicated two-row plots, whereas large-plot,
   open-pollinated corn was grown in unreplicated plots of 12.8 m x 8 rows.
   At Ames, the small-plot, open pollination treatment was not done. Starch
   was extracted from samples of corn harvested from each plot, and
   gelatinization and retrogradation properties were determined using
   differential-scanning calorimetry (DSC). Hybrids exhibited different
   starch gelatinization and retrogradation properties. Significant
   differences (P less than or equal to 0.05) in starch gelatinization and
   retrogradation properties occurred among pollination methods and between
   locations. Pollination method did not influence gelatinization enthalpy
   values, but onset temperature values for gelatinization, and range
   values for retrogradation differed significantly among pollination
   methods. At Ames, treatments gave different values for retrogradation
   enthalpy and percentage of retrogradation. Because of differences in
   some starch characteristics associated with pollination methods,
   self-pollination is recommended when growing samples in small plots for
   research purposes.}},

Abstract = {{1. An experimental approach, manually pollinating all the flowers of
   individual plants, was used to measure the effect of pollen limitation
   on female fecundity of the hummingbird-pollinated perennial shrub
   Echeveria gibbiflora in the ecological preserve of Pedregal de San Angel
   around Mexico City, Mexico. Eleven randomly selected plants were
   manually over-pollinated in all their flowers and another 11 were left
   to be freely visited by natural pollinators.
   2. Manually pollinated plants produced significantly more fruit and
   seeds than control plants (1.38 and 1.74 times, respectively). There was
   no change in average mass of fruits.
   3, Considering individual fruit production per plant sampled three times
   in one season, decreases in fruit mass and average seeds per fruit were
   observed within the same reproductive season for both treatments. For
   the manually pollinated plants, from the start to the end of the
   reproductive season, seed set decreased 55.9\%; while in control plants
   seed set decreased 33.4\% in the same period. For both treatments,
   average fruit mass decreased 26\%.
   4, Vegetative growth was not significantly different between control and
   experimental plants but hand-pollinated plants showed a smaller
   reproduction probability for the following year.
   5, It is concluded that female fecundity in E. gibbiflora is limited by
   pollen early in the reproductive season and by resources in the middle
   and the end of the season.}},

Abstract = {{Embryo development in vivo has been studied in four Citrus aurantium L.
   polyembryonic genotypes. Seeds were collected 65, 85, 105, 125 and 220
   days after pollination (DAP). None of the immature seeds harvested 65
   and 85 DAP contained visible embryos. A single embryo at a more advanced

   micropylar apex of the embryo sac in about 74\% of seeds harvested at
   105 DAP, while at 125 and 220 DAP the majority of seeds had two or more
   embryos at the same developmental stage crowded together. Restriction
   fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of low- and

   of the bigger embryos, located in the central position at the micropylar

   germination of early cotyledon stage (0.8-2.0 mm) embryos to 98\%. The
   optimum sucrose concentration for embryo rescue was 150 mM for the three

Abstract = {{The increasing mobility of Europeans for business and leisure has led to
   a need for reliable information about exposure to seasonal airborne
   allergens during travel abroad. Over the last 10 years or so,
   aeropalynologic and allergologic studies have progressed to meet this
   need, and extensive international networks now provide regular pollen
   and hay-fever forecasts. Europe is a geographically complex continent
   with a widely diverse climate and a wide spectrum of vegetation.
   Consequently, pollen calendars differ from one area to another; however,
   on the whole, pollination starts in spring and ends in autumn. Grass
   pollen is by far the most frequent cause of pollinosis in Europe. In
   northern Europe, pollen from species of the family Betulaceae is a major
   cause of the disorder. In contrast, the mild winters and dry summers of
   Mediterranean areas favor the production of pollen types that are rarely
   found in central and northern areas of the continent (e.g., the genera
   Parietaria, Olea, and Cupressus). Clinical and aerobiologic studies show
   that the pollen map of Europe is changing also as a result of cultural
   factors (e.g., importation of plants for urban parklands) and greater
   international travel (e.g,, the expansion of the ragweed genus Ambrosia
   in France, northern Italy, Austria, and Hungary). Studies on
   allergen-carrying paucimicronic or submicronic airborne particles, which
   penetrate deep into the lung, are having a relevant impact on our
   understanding of pollinosis and its distribution throughout Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Avocado in the Western Galilee region of Israel was found to be
   dependent on honeybees for fruit set. A significant initial fruit set
   required a density of at least five bees per tree during the female
   stage of flowering. The early-blooming avocado cultivars were visited by
   enough honeybees on fewer than one-third of their blooming days. Because
   they were visited mostly at the end of their blooming season, and due to
   rainy days, not more than 5\% of their entire season's flowers were
   exposed to sufficient pollination to set fruit. The late-blooming
   cultivars however, were visited by many bees and exhibited high initial
   fruit set. The attractiveness to honeybees of various avocado cultivars
   and some other plant species, which were found to compete for
   pollination, was measured by the coefficient ``r{''} obtained from
   correlations between bee density and reward measures of these plants,
   over the course of a day or season. At the beginning of the blooming
   season, the avocado flowers competed for nectar-foraging bees mainly
   with flowers of Citrus spp, and for pollen foragers with Brassicaceae
   and Fabaceae, all of which were more attractive to the bees. Since
   pollination was carried out only by nectar-collecting bees, Citrus spp.
   flowers presented the main limiting factor for initial fruit set in
   avocado. However, toward the end of its blooming season, the avocado
   competed with Poaceae, Asteraceae and Apiaceae flowers, and its relative
   attractiveness increased.}},

Abstract = {{The number of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) continues to decline due to
   parasitic mite pests and other factors. Honey bees and bumble bees
   (Bombus impatiens Cresson) were therefore compared for their effects on
   the seed set of watermelon {[}Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. \&
   Nakai] in a 2-year field experiment. The experiment was a 2 x 4 + 2
   factorial, comparing bee type (honey bee or bumble bee) at four
   visitation levels (1, 6, 12, and 18 bee visits) to pistillate flowers,
   with two controls: a no-visit treatment and an open-pollinated
   treatment. Bee visitation level had a strong positive influence on seed
   set (P less than or equal to 0.0001). All flowers bagged to prevent
   insect visitation aborted, demonstrating the need for active pollen
   transfer between staminate and pistillate watermelon flowers. Flowers
   visited by B. impatiens consistently contained more seed than those
   visited by A. mellifera, when compared at equal bee visitation levels (P

Abstract = {{A Cour trap was used to sample the air of Seville of continuously from
   1987 to 1996. The most important climatological feature recorded during
   that period was the drought that began in 1990 and which was at its most
   severe in the first half of 1995.
   The behaviour of a total of 20 pollen types was studied: those exceeding
   0.01\% of the total pollen collected during the ten-year period. These
   were Quercus, Olea, Cupressaceae, Platanus, Myrtaceae, Pinaceae, Palmae,
   Moraceae, Fraxinus, Ericaceae, Citrus, Pistacia, Acer, Casuarina,
   Salicaceae, Ulmus, Alnus, Castanea, Cistaceae, and Viburnum.
   The following aspects are described and analysed: the spectrum of tree
   and shrub types identified in the air, and their possible significance
   for allergies; the relationship between the woody vegetation of the
   region and the composition of the pollen spectrum in quantitative terms;
   and the possible effect of the drought on annual variations total pollen
   concentrations. A detailed study of olive pollen, aimed at finding
   applications in allergy and agriculture is also given. In particular,
   the possibility of forecasting both the dale of olive pollination from
   observations of preceding mean temperatures, and the size of the crop
   from palynological and agronomical data.}},

Volume = {{100}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The existence of Platanus pollinosis is not generally
   accepted despite the production of very large quantities of airborne
   Platanus pollen in many cities of the United States and Europe. The aim
   of this study was to investigate if Platanus pollen really contributes
   to the symptoms of the patients with pollinosis in the Madrid area.
   Methods: We carried out systematic skin prick testing with Platanus
   pollen extract on 47 patients seen in our allergy center with
   spring-summer pollinosis symptoms. Each patient maintained symptom score
   diaries before, during, and after the Platanus pollination season. The
   average symptom scores were calculated and compared with the Platanus
   pollen counts. Measurements of specific IgE by ELISA and immunoblotting
   also were performed in each patient.
   Results: The Platanus skin tests were positive in 33 of the 39 patients
   first seen with seasonal symptoms during Platanus pollen season and only
   in three of the eight patients without symptoms during Platanus exposure
   (Fisher's exact test; p < 0.05). Twenty-two of the 33 Platanus-positive
   skin test patients also had a positive ELISA result. Furthermore, the
   average 24-hour rhinitis symptom scores of the 39 patients first seen
   with seasonal symptoms during March through April showed significant
   correlation with Platanus pollen counts (r(s) = 0.57, p < 0.05). The
   immunoblot results suggest that a 17 kd pollen protein could be a major
   allergen in patients with Platanus pollinosis.
   Conclusions: Platanus pollen is an important cause of pollinosis in
   Madrid. A protein with a molecular weight of 17 kd appeared to be its
   major allergen.}},

Abstract = {{This review provides information about the levels of abscisic acid
   (ABA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellins (GAs) in reproductive
   organs and the effects of uniconazole-P application on those hormones in
   citrus to analyze their possible relationships with fruit set and
   growth. Endogenous phytohormone levels in flowers and fruitlets were
   studied in `Hyuganatsu' (Citrus tamurana {[}Hort.] Ex. Tanaka), which
   had no parthenocarpic ability, and Satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.
   cv. Ozaki). ABA concentration in the style of Satsuma increased 6-fold
   from the bud to the anthesis stage. Stamens in Hyuganatsu contained
   higher concentrations of IAA and GAs than in Satsuma. Immediately after
   pollination, Hyuganatsu showed peaks of ABA and IAA concentrations in
   fruitlets and parthenocarpic Satsuma also showed smaller peaks of ABA
   and IAA concentrations. Parthenocarpic fruitlets contained higher
   concentrations of GAs than pollinated fruitlets after fruit-set.
   `Sepals' which included floral disks, sepals and receptacles in both
   setting types contained higher concentrations of ABA than in the
   nonsetting type, suggesting that ABA in `sepals' plays a positive role.
   `Sepals' in both setting types contained higher concentrations of IAA
   after fruit-set, suggesting that IAA from `sepals' may hinder fruitlet
   abscission. Uniconazole-P, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, markedly
   stimulated fruitlet abscission in Satsuma and increased 4-fold the
   concentration of endogenous ABA in fruitlets. from the bud to the

   passive movement through the phloem vessels, were studied in segregant
   plants derived by self-pollination from P. trifoliata var. `'Flying
   Dragon'' in order to genetically analyze the mechanism of CTV
   resistance. Accumulation of CTV in the vicinity of the inoculum and in
   new flushes was studied by means of a direct tissue-blot immunoassay
   (DTBIA). CTV is able to passively move with the phloematic flux from
   inoculated resistant genotypes Ctr-Rr and Ctr-RR up to a susceptible
   scion cultivar (Ctr-rr). Differences regarding CTV accumulation around
   the inoculum were found among Ctr-Rr individuals of the progeny. Bulked
   segregant analysis identified five RAPD markers linked to a locus (Ctm),
   or a genomic region, involved in short-distance accumulation of CTV but
   located in a different linkage group from Ctr. This result indicates
   that Ctr is not the only locus responsible for resistance to CTV in P.

   citrus is a perennial crop, breeding for durable disease resistance
   should take into account selection at both the Ctl and Ctm loci.}},

Year = {{1997}},

Abstract = {{Introductions of exotic species provide unique opportunities to study
   the demographic significance of species interactions, but as yet there
   is little information on how mutualistic interactions affect the
   invasion process. A shortage of mutualists could potentially limit the
   rate of population growth for an invading species. The introduced shrub
   Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom, Leguminosae) is a pest plant on the
   west coast of North America. It produces flowers that are `'tripped''
   open when pollinated and has a nearly obligatory relationship with
   resident bumble bees and honey bees. Experiments in the state of
   Washington showed that <1\% of untripped flowers produced fruits and
   that outcross-pollinated flowers yielded fourfold more fruit than
   self-pollinated flowers, revealing apparent inbreeding depression. Mean
   pollinator visitation rate, as determined by the proportion of flowers
   tripped, varied among three years and among four populations but was low
   (3-30\%) in every case. Two urban populations (Magnuson Park and
   Discovery Park in Seattle) received higher numbers of visits than two
   native prairie populations (Johnson Prairie and 13th Division Prairie in
   southwestern Washington). Hand-pollination experiments revealed
   significant pollinator limitation in all populations in both 1993 and
   1994, with the mean increase in fruit production ranging from 280 to
   2620\%. Prairie populations were more pollinator limited than urban
   populations. Resources available for per-flower fruit production
   appeared to be equally available in all populations in 1993 but more
   available in prairie populations than in urban populations in 1994. The
   relationship between natural visitation and proportion fruit set per
   branch was a saturating curve in 1993 but a linear function in 1994 and
   1995. Significant correlations were found between pollinator visitation
   and variation in whole-plant fruit production in all 3 yr. No evidence
   was found for either (1) reallocation of resources between branches
   within a season, or (2) a cost of reproduction between seasons in plants
   receiving supplemental pollen. Demographic analysis showed that a very
   large cost of reproduction would be required to counterbalance the
   increase in fecundity achieved with full pollination. Simulations of new
   populations invading over a short time scale (10-30 yr) demonstrated
   little effect of pollen limitation in the slow-growing urban
   populations, but a potentially large effect of increasing pollinator
   visitation in the rapidly invading prairie populations.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{White lupin (Lupinus albus L.) is an annual legume traditionally
   cultivated around the Mediterranean and along the Nile valley where it
   is used for human consumption, green manuring and as forage. The
   composition of the grain and especially the high protein content makes
   white lupin highly suitable for ruminant diets as a protein-rich product
   in intensive farming systems. The absence of anti-nutritional factors
   makes possible a direct on-farm use of white lupin in self-sustained
   systems. Being mainly self-pollinating, commercial varieties are pure
   lines bred through pedigree selection. The major diseases are
   Pleiochaeta setosa for which selection among autumn-sown genotypes was
   effective, Uromyces lupinicolus causing early defoliation under warm and
   dry summers and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (anthracnose).
   Anthracnose is a major threat because this seed-borne disease induces an
   early plant death through stem breakage. No genetic resistance is
   presently available. More breeding effort should be devoted to this
   disease in the future. Frost tolerance of the autumn-sown crops depends
   on the root size, the state of the apex and the hardening ability of the
   vegetative organs. Major improvements were achieved through earlier
   sowing and through selection of winter hardy genotypes with marked
   vernalization requirements. The susceptibility of white lupin to high pH
   and free lime expressed by iron deficiency is due to the root
   functioning with nutrient uptake under normal conditions enhanced by
   citric acid secretion. The recent identification of lime- and high
   pH-tolerant populations offers new possibilities for breeding and for
   physiological study. The elaboration of the lupin mainstem is described
   (leaf primordia production and vernalization) and the relationship
   between mainstem and branches is analyzed. The indeterminate growth
   habit due to the production of successive branch levels induces late
   maturation, allows high potential biomass production, but may lead to
   poor seed yields because of low harvest index. Poor yield stability
   seems inherent to the indeterminacy. In the autumn-sown background,
   determinacy under monogenic recessive control strongly modifies the
   branch structure, separates the vegetative growth and the reproductive
   growth and results in better yield stability. Determinate cultivars
   yield well under early sowing conditions because they produce greater
   biomass, but may then suffer from lodging. Introduction of dwarfism
   significantly reduces internode length and favors dry matter allocation
   to the pods. Breeding is now oriented towards the selection of dwarf
   determinate varieties. Development of molecular biology and
   transformation techniques offers new prospects in white lupin breeding.

Abstract = {{Trifoliate orange {[}Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.] is frequently used
   as a parent in citrus rootstock breeding, but the origin and amount of
   genetic diversity in germ plasm collections are poorly understood. Most
   accessions are self-compatible, but produce a mixture of sexual and
   apomictic seedlings. Variation among 48 vegetatively propagated
   trifoliate orange accessions was assessed at seven isozyme loci,
   together with the restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs)
   detected by 38 probe-enzyme combinations and the inter-simple sequence
   repeat (ISSR) markers generated by II primers. Isozymes and RFLPs
   detected few polymorphisms among accessions, although genetic analysis
   has shown that the common phenotype is heterozygous for four isozyme and
   at least four RFLP loci. ISSR amplification generated multiple banding
   profiles with an average of 58 fragments/primer/accession. These
   fragments were repeatable across DNA samples extracted from different
   trees of the same accession or extracted at different times, and across
   separate PCR runs. Seventeen unique marker phenotypes were identified.
   The 48 trifoliate orange accessions were classified into four major
   groups based on polymorphic ISSR markers. All large-flowered accessions
   are in group 4, while small-flowered accessions are in group 3. Many
   ISSR markers segregated in progeny derived by open-pollination (probably
   mostly selfing) of a common accession, indicating that these ISSR
   markers are also heterozygous. Accessions having identical genotypes for
   a large number of heterozygous markers are unlikely to have diverged by
   recombination. Thus the limited divergence we detected among most
   accessions most likely originated by mutation. `Monoembryonic' and
   `Simmons' differed from other accessions only in the loss of specific
   markers, indicating that they originated as zygotic seedlings of
   individuals similar to the common genotype. Three accessions recently
   introduced from China have relatively different fingerprints with 3-14
   unique ISSR markers, and probably represent a much more divergent germ
   plasm that may be a valuable breeding resource.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive and vegetative tissues of the seeded Pineapple cultivars of
   sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L.) contained the following C-13
   hydroxylated gibberellins (GAs): GA(53), GA(17), GA(19), GA(20), GA(1),
   GA(29), and GA(8), as well as GA(97), 3-epi-GA(1), and several
   uncharacterized GAs. The inclusion of 3-epi-GA(1) as an endogenous
   substance was based on measurements of the isomerization rates of
   previously added {[}H-2(2)]GA(1). Pollination enhanced amounts of
   GA(19), GA(20), GA(29), and GA(8) in developing ovaries. Levels of GA(1)
   increased from 5.0 to 9.5 ng/g dry weight during anthesis and were
   reduced thereafter. The amount of GA in mature pollen was very low.
   Emasculation reduced GA levels and caused a rapid 100\% ovary
   abscission. This effect was partially counteracted by either pollination
   or application of GA(3). In pollinated ovaries, repeated paclobutrazol
   applications decreased the amount of GA and increased ovary abscission,
   although the pattern of continuous decline was different from the sudden
   abscission induced by emasculation. The above results indicate that, in
   citrus, pollination increases GA levels and reduces ovary abscission and
   that the presence of exogenous GA(3) in unpollinated ovaries also
   suppresses abscission. Evidence is also presented that pollination and
   GAs do not, as is generally assumed, suppress ovary abscission through
   the reactivation of cell division.}},

Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of bumble bees, Bombus impatiens Cresson, and honey
   bees, Apis mellifera L., on the pollination of cucumber, Cucumis sativus
   L., and watermelon, Citrullus lanatus (Thunb,) Matsum \& Nakai, was
   compared at the individual and multiple bee level under field
   conditions. Comparisons were based on percent fruit abortion as
   influenced by bee type and the number of bee visits to treatment
   flowers. For both crops, bee visit number was significant, As the number
   of bee visits to flowers increased, the number of fruits aborted
   decreased. With cucumbers, B. impatiens-visited flowers consistently had
   a lower percent abortion than A. mellifera when compared at equal bee
   visit numbers, This difference between bee types was highly significant.
   Differences were not detected between bee types in the watermelon study
   except at low visitation levels (i.e. single bee visit to flower).
   However, abortion rates for bumble bee-visited flowers were consistently
   less or equal to those for honey bees at equal bee visit numbers for
   both crops. There was 100 percent abortion for flowers receiving no
   entomophilous visitation, and significant abortion rates by flowers
   receiving low bee visit numbers, emphasizing the need for active
   transfer of pollen in these crops by insect pollinators. In light of
   decreased honey bee populations due to mite pests and the Africanized
   honey bee, we conclude that bumble bees could serve as a back-up or
   alternate pollinator for honey bees for cucumber and watermelon and
   possibly other vine crops grown in either greenhouse or field
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Karyotypes of 15 species of Cyanotis are reported. C. adscendens (Zn =

   growth, habit are cited as reasons for the low incidence of polyploidy
   in Cyanotis. C. pilosa (2n = 24; n.f. 30) is shown to be the nearest
   among the reported taxa to the most primitive species in the genus - C.
   villosa. C. wightii (2n = 24; n.f. 32) is shown to have a more
   symmetrical karyotype than the above two. C. arachnoidea, C. cristata,
   C. fasciculata, C. longifolia ssp, longifolia var. rupicola, C.
   nodiflora, C. obtusa and C. vaginata, all with 2n = 24; n.f., 26, have

   asymmetrical karyotypes. Karyotype of C. papilionacea (2n = 16; n.f. 20)
   is shown to be nearer to the arachnoidea type inspite of the reduction
   in chromosome number. The above species groups, are suggested to have
   evolved stepwise by centric fusions or unequal translocations or
   pericentric inversions from the `villosa' type. Segregation of these
   into subgeneric units on the basis of karyotype differences is suggested
   to be untenable owing to the lack of a parallel morphological
   discontinuity. The highly asymmetrical karyotypes of C. axillaris and C.
   cucullata (2n = 20; n.f. 20) are shown to support the creation of a
   separate section Ocreaflora in Cyanotis for them.}},

Abstract = {{We present a demographic analysis and suggestions for the conservations
   of Beaucarnea gracilis, a species endemic to the Tebuacan Valley,
   Puebla, Mexico. The species is dioecious, it flowers every year, and the
   breeding system and floral display are typical of a generalist mode of
   pollination. The density of B. gracilis in the study plot was 16.7
   individuals/ha. Distribution of trunk diameter size classes fits a
   normal distribution (n = 404), but the smaller sizes were not found
   (<0.7 m). The inflorescences were visited by 46 insect species. Over
   2600 seeds are produced per inflorescence; 27-30\% are damaged by
   parasites, and the rest germinate readily (90-100\%). Survival of seeds
   and seedling is very low. We found 313 seedlings in a 12-ha area, all
   (94.24\%) of which were at the base of nurse plants; particularly Mimosa
   luisiana and Castela tortuosa. The ecological status of the population
   of Beaucarnea gracilis is relatively good for adult individuals. In
   addition to low recruitment, (whether natural or human influenced), past
   extraction of seedlings for commerce, grazing by goats, and land
   clearing for corn cultivation, highway construction, and urbanization,
   are a real threat to the survival and establishment of seeds and
   seedlings. Conservation of this slow-growing, long-lived species should
   be promoted because (1) ecologically, it is a feeding center for many
   insect species, an important host for many Bromeliaceae, and part of the
   highly rich and endemic flora of Tebuacan and (2) economically, it helps
   low income people in the area (seedlings raised for commerce).
   Protection of nurse plants, regulation of grazing by goats, a halt to
   illegal extraction, and conservation of areas of the Tebuacan valley
   will help the survival of this species in nature.}},
