Abstract = {{The aerobiological studies at Gwalior (India) indicate that there are
   certain months in a year when maximum concentration of pollen grains and
   fungal spores can be observed in the air. A detailed study on nearly 200
   allergic patients reveals that there lies a direct relationship between
   the occurrence of biocomponents and allergic incidences. Allergenicity
   due to insect allergens was also predominant in the city. The
   pollination calendar of Gwalior indicates that a majority of
   biocomponent types belong to the local flora and fauna. Some pollen
   grains of far off places have also been recorded during the study.}},

Abstract = {{Hymenoptera pollinators and figs (ripe or unripe) of Ficus
   vallis-choudae are protected from the predatory activity of myrmicine
   ants (Atopomyrmex mocquerisi; Crematogaster clariventris; Crematogaster
   sp.) by other ants (Camponotus acvapimensis and Camponotus brutus;
   Formicinae) who attack neither unripe figs nor the pollinator. On trees
   occupied by Atopomyrmex and Crematogaster, and on trees invaded by
   columns of workers after recruitment by scouts, the predatory activity
   begins when the fig wasps emerge. Then, the ants attack unripe figs
   (asynchronization in ripeness), destroying whole figs of certain trees.
   The male function of the trees through pollen dispersal by fig wasps is,
   therefore, severely reduced, while the female function (seed dispersal)
   is affected only on unripe figs before fig wasp emergence. We recorded
   13 ant species on the 73 Ficus vallis-choudae of the Batchenga savanna
   (Cameroon) studied, but only the five previously cited species were able
   to occupy an entire fig tree. The three Myrmicinae which have a status
   of dominant (large colony size; strong territoriality vis-a-vis other
   dominant species; can tolerate non-dominant species) tended scale
   insects. Both Camponotus species (and the eight other ant species) are
   non-dominant (small colony size), but are able to occupy a whole tree
   under certain conditions (here, when they tend the tettigometrid Hilda
   undata) and to be territorial. Their status corresponds, therefore, to
   that of sub-dominant. Tests of aggressiveness showed that each ant
   species is aggressive towards alien conspecifics. C. brutus individuals
   were tolerated on fig trees occupied by Atopomyrmex mocquerisi or by
   Crematogaster clariventris, while workers of both latter species, who do
   not tolerate one another, were not tolerated on fig trees occupied by C.
   brutus. In this situation. the cost-benefit for the trees depends on the
   ant species that occupies their foliage; C. brutus, when tending
   tettigometrids, is advantageous. There is, therefore, an indirect
   influence of the tettigometrids on the production of fig pollinating
   wasps and seeds.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence has been presented in citrus suggesting that initiation of
   fruit growth is promoted by mediators of hormonal nature, such as
   gibberellins, that are able to respond to internal and external stimuli.
   In seeded citrus, pollination increases GA levels and reduces ovary
   abscission, whereas exogenous GAs mimic the effects of pollination on
   fruit set of non-pollinated fruits. In seedless cultivars, a large
   number of observations indicate that gibberellins are one of the
   limiting and crucial factors regulating parthenocarpic fruit initiation.
   While cytokinins have also been involved in the improvement of fruit
   set, the role of auxins appear to be related to the control of fruit
   size and retardation of pre-harvest abscission. After hormone
   stimulation, fruit development is mostly supported by the disponibility
   of nutrients. It is also known that unfavorable environmental
   conditions, as well as a shortage of carbohydrates, activate synthesis
   of regulatory compounds involved in the processes of abscission, such as
   abscisic acid and ethylene. Abscission of developing fruits appears to
   be under hormonal regulation according to the sequence: ABA --> ACC -->
   ethylene --> fruit abscission.}},

   citrus which is first and apple which is second. Total tonnage for
   persimmon is estimated at 302,200 tons in 1994 and it accounts for about
   7\% of the total fruit tonnage of major fruit crops. Wakayama, Fukuoka,
   Nara and Gifu Prefectures are primary production areas, followed by
   Aichi, Ehime, Niigata and Yamagata Prefectures. Currently, principal
   cultivars are `Fuyu', `Matsumotowase Fuyu', `Jiro' and `Maekawa Jiro'
   for nonastringent-types and `Hiratanenashi', `Tonewase' and `Hachiya'
   for astringent-types. Among pollination-variant and nonastringent-types,
   `Nishimurawase' is the most popular cultivar. There is a breeding
   program for early ripening, nonastringent cultivars, with large fruit
   and high quality at the Fruit Research Station at Akitsu Branch, where
   new cultivars have been released recently. Other research trends are
   focusing on the cultural practices such as training system for reducing
   tree height, crop production in plastic houses for improving fruit
   duality, postharvest studies related to artificial treatments for
   astringency removal, physiological aspects for fruit set and development
   and chemical properties of persimmon tannins. Crop improvement utilizing
   protoplast culture or transformation, is also progressing.}},

Abstract = {{Aeropalynological methods are used to examine the flowering seasons of
   18 different plant taxa in Budapest between 1991-1996. Start dates, end
   dates, length of flowering season and yearly totals of pollen grains are
   computed and the main characteristics of the pollen seasons are examined
   in relation to meteorological factors.
   The aim is to obtain a picture of phenological characteristics of these
   taxa, the order of their flowering, the length of their seasons, the
   amount of pollen emitted and the year-to-year variability in these
   parameters. By analysing phenological data in relation to meteorological
   data, conclusions can be drawn, which may be applicable in other cities,
   and which can help to create models for predicting phenological events
   in the future. Of the allergenic taxa, Ambrosia, Poaceae, Quercus,
   Betula, Fraxinus and Platanus emitted the largest amounts of pollen
   during the period examined.
   In general, pre-seasonal temperature had the greatest influence on the
   start of the season, where as higher temperature seems to promote
   pollination. In the cases of woody plants, pre-seasonal precipitation
   had no effect on pollen production. These results are in agreement with
   observations in areas with an atlantic climate. However the start of the
   grass season is influenced more by pre-seasonal precipitation, than
   temperature. The total yearly pollen count for the grasses also
   correlates with pre-seasonal precipitation. Thus, precipitation is an
   important limiting factor for the pollination of grasses, since the
   upper parts of the soil usually dry out during the spring.}},

   and pollen carryover effects - commonly cited as potentially important
   in evaluating pollinator guilds - had minor effects (0-0.6\% change) on
   the estimates of relative contribution based on visit frequency and
   single-visit efficacy alone. Beeflies visited significantly more flowers
   per inflorescence than the bees and the moth. Seed set remained
   virtually constant during the first three visited flowers for beeflies
   and larger bees, indicating that apparent pollen carryover did not
   reduce per-visit efficacy of these taxa. In contrast, Greya moth visits
   showed a decrease in seed set by 55.4\% and the smaller bees by 45.4\%
   from first to second flower. The larger carryover effects in smaller
   bees and Greya were diminished in importance by their small overall
   contribution to seed set. Three variable plant traits may affect seed
   set: ovule number, resource limitation on seed maturation, and pollen
   output. Ovule number per flower declined strongly with later position
   within inflorescences. Numbers were much higher in first-year
   greenhouse-grown plants than in field populations, and differences
   increased during 3 years of study. Mean pollen count by position varied
   7-fold among flowers; it paralleled ovule number variation, resulting in
   a relatively stable pollen:ovule ratio. Resource limitation of seed set
   increased strongly with later flowering, with seed set in
   hand-pollinated flowers ranging from 66\% in early flowers to 0\% in the
   last two flowers of all plants. Variation in ovule number and resource
   limitation of seed maturation jointly had a strong effect on the number
   of seeds per flower. Visitation to early flowers had the potential to
   cause more seed set than visitation to later flowers. Overall, the most
   important sources of variation to seed production contribution were
   differences among pollinators in abundance and absolute efficacy (ovules
   fertilized on a single visit) and potentially differential phenology
   among visitor species. These effects are likely to vary among
   populations and years.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the great economic importance of citrus, its phylogeny and
   taxonomy remain a matter of controversy. Moreover pathogens of increased
   virulence and dramatic environmental changes are currently spreading or
   emerging. The objectives of the present paper, measuring genetic
   variability and studying its pattern of distribution, are crucial steps
   to optimize sampling strategies in the search of genotypes that tolerate
   or resist these threatening factors within the huge array of Citrus and
   Citrus related species. Their intraspecific and intrageneric variability
   was studied comparatively by means of ten enzymatic systems using eight
   different measures. The analysis of ten enzymatic systems allowed us to
   distinguish all the species and all but one artificial hybrid. The
   species with the lowest genotypic variability are C. myrtifolia, C.
   deliciosa (willow leaf mandarin), C. paradisi (grapefruit), C. limon
   (lemon) and C. sinensis (sweet orange), while Severinia buxifolia shows
   the highest value. A broad spectrum of heterozygosity values was found
   in the collection. Lemons (C. limon, C. meyeri, C. karna, C.
   volkameriana), limes (C. aurantifolia, C. limettioides, C. lattifolia)
   and C. bergamia show a very high percentage of heterozygosity which
   indicates an origin through interspecific hybridization. Two main
   factors limit genetic intraspecific variability: apomictic reproduction:
   where nucellar embryos are much more vigorous than the zygotic ones, and
   nursery-men selecting against variability in the seedling stage of the
   rootstocks or in propagating the scion cultivars vegetatively.
   Additionally, self-pollination appears in some species mainly used as
   rootstocks which would explain their low heterozygosity values. Genetic
   differences between species and genera are in general high, which
   suggests that adaptation might have played an important role during the
   evolution of the orange subfamily.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of our study was the evaluation of clinical and epidemiological
   aspects of P pollen allergy, which is a very frequent cause of
   respiratory allergy in the Mediterranean area, in a homogeneous group of
   442 monosensitive subjects (235 females and 207 males, mean age about 30
   years) living in Naples. All patients underwent the following diagnostic
   procedures: anamnestic evaluation with an internal questionnaire,
   physical examination, SPT with commercially available allergenic
   extracts (DHS-Bayropharm Milan Italy); sNPT, NsBPT, and serum specific
   IgE determinations were also carried out in three groups of 50 different
   subjects. The results of our study show a highly relevant intensity of
   SPT positivity (++++ and +++ in about 95\% of patients). The age of
   onset of clinical symptoms ranged between 20-25 years, and the majority
   of P monosensitized patients were born in the spring months, with an
   early exposure to P allergens. Rhinoconjunctivitis and bronchial asthma,
   alone or in association, represent the most common clinical
   manifestation of this allergy. The season in which patients experience
   clinical symptoms is prevalently spring (75, 12\%). However, many people
   show a multiseasonal pattern (18, 55\%). The frequency of SPT positivity
   to P allergens is increasing in the last 15 years, probably due to
   increased urban air pollution. IN conclusion, the results of this study
   demonstrate the high frequency and severity of this pollinosis and seem
   to confirm some epidemiological aspects connected with other allergenic
   pollens (birth during the seasonal period of pollination and association
   with a high urban air pollution).}},

Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{36}},

Pages = {{731-738}},
Abstract = {{In a breeding program aimed at developing new seedless citrus cultivars,
   crosses were conducted between Silverhill satsuma and Imperial mandarin
   as seed parents, and sweet orange and pummelo cultivars as pollen
   parents. Poncirus trifoliata pollen was also used to provide a
   morphological marker to compare each seed parent's ability to produce
   hybrid seedlings. Both Silverhill and Imperial can produce seedless
   fruits. Methods used to produce and identify hybrids highlighted the
   relative ease with which either can be used as a seed parent.
   Imperial mandarin produced more seeds per fruit (mean >8) than
   Silverhill satsuma (mean <4), thus requiring fewer controlled
   pollinations to produce desired numbers of hybrids. Germination rates of
   Imperial-cross seeds were generally greater than for Silverhill-cross
   seeds. A single seedling emerged from every Imperial-cross seed that
   germinated, demonstrating the monoembryonic nature of Imperial seeds.
   All Imperial x P. trifoliata seedlings were hybrids, confirmed by their
   trifoliate leaves. From this, all seedlings from other Imperial-cross
   seeds were assumed to be hybrids. By contrast, embryo rescue after in
   vitro germination demonstrated the polyembryonic nature of the
   Silverhill-cross seeds. Mean embryo number per Silverhill seed varied
   from 3.6 to 12.0 between crosses, and from 2 to 30 between seeds within
   crosses. About 50\% of all embryos from Silverhill-cross seeds were
   rescued and retained for hybrid identification.
   Silverhill hybrids were identified visually and/or by isozyme banding
   patterns. Silverhill x pummelo hybrids were identified or confirmed
   using glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and phosphoglucomutase
   isozymes. Silverhill x Sweet orange hybrids were identified using
   isocitrate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucoisomerase or shikimic acid
   dehydrogenase (SKD) isozymes, although the banding patterns for SKD
   isozymes were complex and difficult to interpret genetically.
   Thirty-three Silverhill satsuma hybrids were identified. This
   represented a hybrid recovery rate of 11.15\% compared with greater than
   or equal to 90\% for every Imperial-cross combination.}},

Abstract = {{The fig tree - fig wasp mutualism has long been considered to be
   strictly species-specific: each fig tree species is obligatorily
   pollinated by one fig wasp species, and each wasp species can only
   reproduce in one fig species. The first exceptions cited were thought to
   result from misidentifications of either figs or wasps, but as for most
   dogmas in biology, increasing knowledge of the mutualism has led to
   question the strict one-to-one rule. More and more examples of
   co-occurrence of at least two pollinators per fig species are provided
   from all over the world. I define below 6 categories of co-occurrence of
   more than one species of pollinators and 3 categories of pollination of
   different species of Ficus by the same species of pollinator. I give an
   accurate description of the state of our knowledge on the exceptions to
   the one-to-one rule in the different biogeographic regions and discuss
   the relatively high number of breakdowns to the rule, in South-Eastern
   Asia.}},

Abstract = {{Adventitious shoots were obtained from the diploid watermelon
   {[}Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. \& Nakai] cultivars Dixielee,
   Jubilee II, Mickylee, Minilee, and Royal Sweet by culturing excised
   cotyledons on shoot regeneration medium for six weeks. Tetraploid and
   diploid regenerants were identified by counting the number of
   chloroplasts per guard cell pair from leaves of regenerated plants.
   Cross fertilization of putative tetraploids with diploid pollinators and
   the production of triploid seed confirmed the efficacy of this approach.
   The mean number of chloroplasts for tetraploid regenerants was 19.1
   whereas diploids averaged 11.2. These values were similar to tetraploid
   and diploid plants from seed. Ovary diameter, petal, and anther diameter
   of male flowers, and leaf length by width ratio were also good
   indicators of plant ploidy. Progeny obtained from self-fertile
   tetraploids of `Mickylee' were crossed with various diploid pollinators
   to produce triploid hybrid seed. All triploid plants from tissue
   culture-derived tetraploids produced fruit comparable in quality to
   fruit produced by currently-available triploid hybrids, demonstrating
   that in vitro tetraploid induction can be used to produce high quality
   tetraploid plants for use in triploid hybrid seed production.}},

   `Fujihikari', characterized by its striped and spherical fruit with

   While `Sweet Princess', which has non-striped and oval fruit with small
   seeds, is an American cultivar bred at the North Carolina Agricultural
   Experiment Station. Initially, they were hybridized and crossed once
   with the offspring of a self-pollinated `Fujihikari'. Then the offspring
   selected for their distinguishing characteristics were self-pollinated
   three times. In the resultant filial generation, segregation of the
   characteristics of fruit shape and seed size was observed. It was
   determined that two fruit shapes, spherical (O-S) and oval (O+), are
   controlled by a single allele which shows incomplete dominance, while
   seed size was found to be controlled by a dominant or epistatic short
   seed gene (Ti), and a recessive or hypostatic medium seed gene (ti).}},

Abstract = {{Clementine (Citrus reticulata {[}Hort.] Ex. Tanaka cv. Oroval) is a
   self-incompatible mandarin with a slow rate of fruit growth and high
   percentage of fruit abscission. Seedless Satsuma (Citrus unshiu {[}Mak]
   Marc. cv. Clausellina) shows natural parthenocarpy and higher fruit set.
   Application of 25 mu g fruit(-1) of paclobutrazol (PP333), an inhibitor
   of gibberellin biosynthesis, reduced the rate of growth and accelerated
   fruit abscission in both varieties. In contrast, gibberellin A(3)
   (GA(3)) stimulated fruit growth only in the self-incompatible mandarin.
   Clementine fruits, in the absence of pollination, showed an
   approximately 2-fold transient increase in the free abscisic acid (ABA)
   content shortly after petal fall, In Satsuma, a very small accumulation
   of ABA was detected, Paclobutrazol treatment induced a 3-fold increase
   in ABA in Satsuma fruits but did not substantially affect the pattern of
   ABA accumulation in Clementine. In this variety, GA(3) suppressed the
   ABA increase observed in untreated fruits. These effects were observed
   24 h after treatment. However, in Satsuma fruits, the effect of GA(3) on
   the ABA content was negligible. In addition, a comparative analysis of
   growing and non-growing fruits of Clementine showed that ABA, on a per
   unit weight basis, was always higher in the nongrowing fruits. Treatment
   with 85 mu M fluridone, an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis and thus
   indirectly of ABA, delayed fruit abscission in Clementine, but also
   decreased fruit growth. Collectively, these observations indicate a
   relationship between high ABA content and a reduced rate of fruit growth
   and an acceleration of fruit abscission.}},

   (Citrullus lanatus Matsum) at anthesis increased fruit set from 26.9\%

   anthesis induced parthenocarpy, yielding 65\% and 89.5\% fruit set,
   respectively with 20 and 200 ppm applications. However, 64\% of the 20
   ppm CPPU-treated parthenocarpic fruit stopped growth 10 days after

   increased significantly compared,vith growth of control fruit during the
   first 10 days after treatment, but, except for the 20 ppm CPPU
   parthenocarpic fruit, growth subsequently slowed, resulting in fruit
   equal in size to the control by harvest. CPPU application did not affect
   soluble solids content of pollinated fruit, but reduced content of
   parthenocarpic fruit treated with 20 ppm. Fructose content was generally
   higher than glucose and sucrose at harvest. However, in pollinated fruit
   treated with 20 ppm CPPU, sucrose levels were higher than glucose and
   fructose. These results suggest that CPPU is practical for promoting
   fruit set and seedless fruit without adversely affecting fruit quality

Abstract = {{`Valencia' orange, a commercially important cultivar of Citrus, forms
   polyembryonic seeds by an apomictic process called nucellar embryony in
   which many embryos initiate directly from nucellar cells surrounding the
   sexual embryo sac. We observed anther, ovule, seed, and fruit
   development in relation to nucellar embryo development in seeds and
   unfertilized ovules of `Valencia'. Pollination and fertilization are
   required to set fruit in `Valencia', and low seed set was found to be
   related to defects in both male and female gametogenesis. Nucellar
   embryo initial cells were evident histologically in ovules of flowers
   just prior to anthesis. However, in vitro culture of ovules from flowers
   at different prepollination stages showed that embryos could develop
   from ovules cultured as early as the binucleate stage of
   megagametogenesis in which nucellar initial cells were absent
   histologically. During fruit development, the timing and sequence of the
   early events of nucellar embryo formation were synchronous in seeds and
   unfertilized ovules, indicating a co-ordinated control of embryo
   development in spatially and developmentally distinct structures. In
   both developing seeds and unfertilized ovules, embryo initial cells
   first formed thick walls, which isolated them from surrounding maternal
   tissue. In later stages, the cell walls thinned in some initial cells
   and embryogenesis became asynchronous. Cleavage of embryogenic cells
   coincided with degenerative processes linked to embryo sac expansion in
   seeds and to a previously unreported, localized degeneration in the
   central portion of the nucellus in unfertilized ovules. Some initial
   cells never divided. Nucellar embryo development was restricted to the
   central portion of unfertilized ovules and to the micropylar region of
   seeds. Only fertilized ovules had the capacity to form mature
   polyembryonic seeds. In unfertilized ovules a specialized vascular
   structure formed linking developing embryos to the chalazal vasculature
   of the ovule. Embryo development arrested at the globular stage in
   unfertilized ovules and the integuments differentiated to form a seed
   coat. The timing of reproductive events described was linked to floral
   and fruit morphological characteristics to facilitate molecular
   characterization of nucellar embryogenesis and seed formation in this
   cultivar.}},

   indicates that the degree of female fertility and sterility can be

   the average number of seeds per fruit by hand pollination and that by
   open pollination was greater in male sterile cultivars and in
   self-incompatible cultivars than it was in self-compatible cultivars.
   This indicates that self-incompatibility as well as male sterility is

Abstract = {{`Flying Dragon' Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf. is a dwarfing rootstock for
   citrus. Inheritance of dwarfing ability was studied in a population of
   open-pollinated seedlings of `Flying Dragon'. Molecular marker genotypes
   suggest that all seedlings originated from selfing. Progeny seedlings
   were budded with `Cutter Valencia' orange and planted in the field to
   evaluate the dwarfing effect of the seedling rootstock. At 5 years after
   planting, rankit analysis of the frequency distributions of trunk
   cross-sectional area and canopy volume suggested the presence of two
   overlapping distributions of 34 dwarf trees and 7 nondwarf. This ratio
   is consistent with inheritance of rootstock dwarfing as a single
   dominant gene for which `Flying Dragon' is' heterozygous. Two
   morphological characteristics of `Flying Dragon', curved thorns and
   twisted trunk growth, were closely linked to, or pleiotropic effects of,
   the dwarfing gene. Bulked segregant analysis was used to identify three
   RAPD markers linked to the dwarfing gene. `Flying Dragon' was identical
   to nondwarfing cultivars of trifoliate orange at 40 homozygous and
   heterozygous isozyme and RFLP markers; therefore, it is likely that
   `Flying Dragon' originated as a mutant of a nondwarfing genotype and has
   not undergone sexual recombination since this event.}},

   Citrus (Citrus sinensis x Poncirus trifoliata). Callose is laid after
   differentiation of the megaspore mother cell, which is also surrounded
   by a thick callosic wall, and before flower opening. In a monoembryonic
   species (Citrus limon) the megaspore mother cell is the only nucellar
   cell surrounded by callose. This could emphasize the role of callose in
   isolation of cells that engage in a new morphogenetic path. This beta
   (1-3) glucan can be used as a precocious marker of nucellar
   embryogenesis in situ and of somatic embryogenesis in vitro.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of synthetic cytokinins (BA, kinetin, CPPU) on
   fruit set and parthenocarpy of four watermelon (Citrullus lanatus
   Matsum) cultivars. Application of CPPU to the ovary at anthsis
   dramatically increased set and induced parthenocarpy of ail cultivars
   examined. Application of BA remarkably promoted fruit set of pollinated
   flowers but did not induce parthenocarpy. Kinetin had few effects on
   fruit set and parthenocarpy. Sugar content(Brix) of parthenocarpic fruit
   produced by CPPU treatment was about the same as in control (pollinated)
   fruit. Concerning specific sugars, fructose content was higher than
   glucose and sucrose at harvest time. As with Brix, there was no
   relationship CPPU application. CPPU treatment may be a practical way to
   promote fruit-set and seedless fruit production without affecting fruit
   size and internal quality of watermelon.}},

   Orange, was studied using morphological and biochemical characters.
   Success of pollen tube growth in the pistil following interspecific
   pollination to B. prionotes and B. menziesii was largely related to
   taxonomic distance between the species, and the results indicated close
   affinity between the series Banksia and Crocinae. Control of pollen tube
   growth in the pistil was imposed in the pollen presenter, a specialized
   area of the distal style, and in the upper style. Hybrid status cv Waite
   Orange was confirmed using morphological characters, and isozyme and
   arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) analysis confirmed
   that the two parent species were sister taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Double-stranded RNA analysis indicated that widespread latent infection
   by citrus tristeza virus (CTV) occurs naturally in a citrus variety
   collection at Merbein, Australia. Detection was based on the presence of
   the putative replicative form (RF) of the virus (ca 19.5 kilobase pairs)
   and the presence or absence of three previously known putative
   subgenomic dsRNAs with molecular sizes of ca 3.1, 1.7 and 0.8 kilobase
   pairs. With the exception of some citrus relatives normally used as
   rootstocks, the dsRNAs were readily detectable in all the trees tested.
   Variability was noticed among the dsRNAs profiles of individual seedling
   trees of Microcitrus australasica var. sanguinea. By contrast, dsRNA
   patterns of trees of open-pollinated Ellendale tangor were
   indistinguishable. A number of dsRNA bands found in West Indian lime
   infected with CTV were not detected when this isolate was
   graft-inoculated to healthy sweet orange seedlings. A simple method for
   enhancing the sensitivity of detection of the CTV dsRNA bands by silver
   staining is described which involves incubating the gels in RNase A
   prior to staining; this allowed detection of the putative CTV RF in only
   40 mg of green bark material.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the reproductive biology of the Crassulaceae. We
   studied a population of Echeveria gibbiflora in the Pedregal de San
   Angel ecological preserve in Mexico City, Mexico. Each flower is open
   and producing nectar 7 to 8 days. On the days of maximum nectar
   production (flowers 4-6 days old) an average of 14.5 mul accumulates in
   a flower per day. The maximum rate of nectar production is between 0700
   and 0900 hours. The average sugar concentration in the nectar is 43.7\%.
   In a given flower, pollen is exposed and the stigmas are receptive at
   the same time. The average natural fruit-set-and seed-set are 56.6\% and
   35.5\%, respectively. The pollen-ovule ratio is 124, and the plants are
   fully self-compatible. The flowers are pollinated by only one species of
   hummingbird (Cynanthus latirostris) and are never visited by insects.
   Pollen movement is very limited (mean of pollinator flight distances =
   0.72 m, mean distance fluorescent dyes = 0.92 m). Seed dispersion is by
   gravity and wind, and also is very limited (an average of 1.07 m). The
   total genetic neighborhood area is 15 m2 to 17 m2, producing a
   neighborhood effective population size (N(b)) of 5.01 to 39.7
   individuals. This is a very small N(b), indicating that genetic drift
   may be a dominant force in the evolution of this species.}},

   not slow sufficiently to permit the wasps to remain within their
   sheltered larval habitat (the fig inflorescence) throughout winter, a
   season in which the short-lived adults have little chance of finding an
   oviposition site. The difficulty of wasp persistence through winter is
   probably a major factor limiting most fig-pollinator mutualisms to the

   one fertile site close to the original plantation, the families showed
   normal growth, high survival rate, and good adaptability, as indicated
   by minimal frost damage. The average height was 3.1 m at 11 years, and
   8.7 m at 21 years, reaching the height observed in native stands of
   black walnut. Therefore, the parent trees and their progenies could be
   used to produce seed for planting on similar sites. The results of this
   study demonstrated the importance of cold hardiness when introducing
   species into the northern temperate climatic zone.}},

Abstract = {{Satsuma (Citrus unshiu {[}Mak] Marc.) and Clementine (Citrus reticulata
   {[}Hort.] Ex. Tanaka, cv Oroval) are two species of seedless mandarins
   differing in their tendency to develop parthenocarpic fruits. Satsuma is
   a male-sterile cultivar that shows a high degree of natural
   parthenocarpy and a high fruit set. Seedless Clementine varieties are
   self-incompatible, and in the absence of cross-pollination show a very
   low ability to set fruit. The gibberellins (GAs) GA53, putative
   17-OH-GAs3, GA44, GA17, GA19, GA20, GA29, GA1, 3-epi-GA1, GA8, GA24,
   GA9, and GA4 have been identified from developing fruits of both species
   by full-scan combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Using
   selected ion monitoring with {[}H-2(2)]- and {[}C-13]-labeled internal
   standards, the levels of GA53, GA44, GA19, GA20, GA1, GA8, GA4, and GA9
   were determined in developing ovaries at anthesis and 7 days before and
   after anthesis, from both species. Except for GA8, levels of the
   13-hydroxy-GAs were higher in Satsuma than in Clementine, and these
   differences were more prominent for developing young fruits. At petal
   fall, Satsuma had, on a nanograms per gram dry weight basis, higher
   levels of GA53 (10.4x), GA44 (13.9x), GA19 (3.0x), GA20 (11.2x), and GA1
   (2.0x). By contrast, levels of GA8 were always higher in Clementine,
   whereas levels of GA4 did not differ greatly. Levels of GA9 were very
   low in both species. At petal fall, fruitlets of Satsuma and Clementine
   contained 65 and 13 picograms of GA1, respectively. At this time, the
   application of 25 micrograms of paclobutrazol to fruits increased fruit
   abscission in both varieties. This effect was reversed by the
   simultaneous applications of 1 microgram of GA3.GA3 alone improved the
   set in Clementine (13x), but had little influence on Satsuma. Thus,
   seedless fruits of the self-incompatible Clementine mandarin may not
   have adequate GA levels for fruit set. Collectively, these results
   suggest that endogenous GA content in developing ovaries is the limiting
   factor controlling the parthenocarpic development of the fruits.}},

Abstract = {{Over 60 exotic Ficus (fig) species have been introduced into southern
   Florida as ornamentals.  Three of these, F. altissima Blume, F.
   benghalenis L., and F. microcarpa L. are now weedy because they are
   pollinated routinely by immigrant agaonid wasps {[}Eupristina sp.,
   Eupristina masoni Saunders, and Parapristina verticillata (Waterston)
   respectively].  Conditions for colonization by these wasps appear to
   have been met, and are potentially suitable for pollination of two other
   fig species.  Four other immigrant wasp species (three pteromalids and a
   torymid) occupy the fruits of F. microcarpa and may interact with the
   pollinating wasps.  Such interactions are more complex, but scarcely
   understood, in the native F. aurea Nuttall and F. citrifolia P. Miller,
   in which at least 10 and 14 species respectively of other animals occur
   routinely.  These other animals include Hymenoptera (Torymidae,
   Eurytomidae, and Pteromalidae), Diptera (Cecidomyiidae), Coleoptera
   (Staphylinidae), Acarina (Tarsonemidae), and Nematoda (Diplogasteridae
   and Aphelenchoididae).  Because of their potentially negative effect on
   agaonid populations, non-pollinating fig faunas should be examined to
   determine whether they may play a role in control of weedy figs.}},

   Pollen viability of the 4X Hyuganatsu as ascertained by FDA staining
   procedure was lower than that of the 2X Hyuganatsu.
   2. In the pollen tubes of the 4X Hyuganatsu, the normal male germ unit
   consisting of 2 sperm nuclei and 1 vegetative nucleus was not formed
   regularly; 46.4\% of the pollen tubes cultured in vitro did not contain
   any nucleus even after 22 hr at 30-degrees-C.

Abstract = {{We examined foreleg length and body size variation in two species of
   oil-collecting bees (Rediviva; Melittidae) in southern Africa. 
   Oil-collecting bees harvest oil from host flowers by rubbing their
   forelegs against oil-secreting trichomes.  Significant differences in
   foreleg length occur among populations of both species.  Rediviva
   ``pallidula{''} populations vary significantly in mean foreleg length
   (11.34 +/- 0.42 mm to 12.67 +/- 0.36 mm), but not in body length (10.59
   +/- 0.74 to 10.80 +/- 0.64), and foreleg length and body size are not
   significantly correlated.  Instead, foreleg variation appears to be a
   function of host plant spur length.  Ninety-two percent of the variance
   in foreleg length of R. ``pallidula{''} is explained by mean Diascia
   spur length.  Rediviva rufocincta populations vary significantly in mean
   foreleg length (10.12 +/- 0.70 mm to 12.34 +/- 0.68 mm) and in body
   length (9.03 +/- 0.26 mm to 10.56 +/- 0.24 mm).  Foreleg length scales
   allometrically with body size in this species as 90.5\% of the variance
   in foreleg length can be explained as a function of body length.  Body
   size appears to be constrained by the morphology of the oil-secreting
   host plant.
   Both bees collect floral oil with specially modified setae on the tarsi
   of their forelegs.  The length of the disti- + mediotarsus (refered to
   here as ``tarsus{''}) in relation to the entire foreleg is shorter in R.
   rufocincta and does not increase as rapidly with increasing foreleg
   length as for R. ``pallidula.{''}  These differences in variation can be
   attributed to differences in position of oil within the flowers of the
   respective host plants.  Rediviva ``pallidula{''} collects oil from
   Diascia species that have the oil deeply situated in narrow floral spurs
   of varying length, while R. rufocincta collects oil from the broadly
   saccate flowers of Bowkeria verticillata and B. citrina.}},

Abstract = {{Parthenocarpy, the production of fruits without viable seeds, is a
   widespread phenomenon in plants.  While failure to effect pollination or
   fertilization is often cited as the cause of parthenocarpy, this
   explanation alone is inadequate to explain why plants produce, maintain
   and further develop fruits.  Wild parsnips (Pastinaca sativa) frequently
   produce parthenocarpic fruit.  When parsnip webworms (Depressaria
   pastinacella), specialist feeders on wild parsnip, were given choices
   between normal fruit and parthenocarpic fruit, they exhibited a strong
   preference for parthenocarpic fruit.  However, on parthenocarpic fruit,
   insects fed less efficiently and grew more slowly than insects fed
   normal fruit.  Parthenocarpic fruits, then, may act as decoys that
   divert herbivores away from fruits that contain plant offspring.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of airborne pollen was conducted during 1984 in the coastal
   plain of Israel.  The flora of that area is continuously changing due to
   urbanization and agriculture, thus affecting the airborne pollen
   spectrum.
   Significant pollen counts were monitored throughout the year, with a
   seasonal peak during spring.  Meteorological parameters, such as wind
   velocity, wind direction and temperature affected pollen content of the
   air.  Under certain conditions, even pollen of insect-pollinated plant
   species was found in the air.
   The most conspicuous among the airborne pollen were olive, cypress and
   pine trees as well as pollen grains from the Poaceae, Amaranthaceae,
   Chenopodiaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae and Urticaceae.
   Results indicate that most of the airborne pollen grains were of local
   origin and from cultivated trees.  Thus, it is possible to reduce
   airborne pollen contaminants around human habitations by selection of
   the proper non-allergic ornamental plants.}},

Abstract = {{Flower, pod and seed development were studied in the cultivars Cita-1
   and Cita-2 in two field trials in 1985-86, in Ibadan, Nigeria. 
   Flowering within any inflorescence was acropetal.  On each plant the
   terminal inflorescence was the first to flower and, generally,
   inflorescences developed basipetally.  A total of 569 flowers (mean of
   five plants) opened on Cita-1; of these, 20 were on the terminal
   inflorescence, 130 on axillary inflorescences and 419 on inflorescences
   on primary branches.  For the 605 flowers (mean of five plants) which
   opened on Cita-2, the distribution was 19, 161 and 425, respectively. 
   On Cita-1, 158 pods formed on average, of which 7 were on the terminal
   inflorescence, 33 on axillary inflorescences and 118 on inflorescences
   on primary branches lower down the plant.  On Cita-2, for the 185 pods
   counted at maturity, the distribution was 8, 43 and 134, respectively. 
   Some 72 and 69\% of the total number of flowers which opened on Cita-1
   and Cita-2, respectively, were aborted.  In both cultivars, 99\% of the
   mature pods were formed from flowers which opened within 24 days of the
   start of anthesis; the number of pods retained largely determined seed
   yield.  The inflorescences which developed on the primary branches
   contributed 70\% (Cita-1) and 66\% (Cita-2) of the total seed yield. 
   Early-formed pods were heavier than those formed later.  Individual pods
   attained physiological maturity 35-42 days after successful pollination
   of the flower.  At physiological maturity of the pod, the seed contained
   3.72\% N, 0.45\% P and 2.76\% K, and the husk contained 1.98\% N, 0.16\%
   P and 1.96\% K.  The majority of open flowers which aborted were
   produced on primary branches, indicating that the primary branches have
   the greatest potential for increasing seed yield.  A shorter flowering
   period might ensure greater retention of open flowers.}},
