Title = {{Seasonal abundance and diversity of native bees in a patchy agricultural
   landscape in Southern Mexico}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Diversity and abundance of native bees was measured in four sites of an
   agricultural landscape dominated by soybean crops in Southern Mexico.
   Bees were sampled from June 2014 to May 2015 using entomological nets
   along five 500 m long transects in each site. Two sites (S1 and S2) were
   fully anthropized (100\% of urban and agricultural land use) and the two
   other sites (R1 and R2) were on average less anthropized with 27.5\% of
   forest relicts. Overall, we collected 2115 specimens; the most abundant
   species were Augochlora (Oxystoglossella) aurifera (12.8\%), Trigona
   fuscipennis (9.2\%), and T. fulviventris (8.6\%). The highest diversity
   was observed in June and July (rainy season), in sites S2 and S1. Site
   S2 had the greatest diversity and abundance (56 species, 885
   individuals), followed by S1 (41 species, 577 individuals), R2 (38
   species, 289 individuals) and R1 (25 species, 117 individuals). However,
   rarefaction analysis showed no significant difference among four sites.
   Compared to studies carried out in protected natural areas with similar
   climatic conditions, our results suggest that small-scale agriculture in
   southern Mexico apparently does not affect detrimentally pollinator
   populations as expected. Thus, this study suggest that the presence of
   preserved patches contributes to the richness and abundance of bees, due
   to the maintenance of wild flowers and ruderal plants in patches next to
   the crop fields, providing a continuous source of pollen, nectar and
   shelters. Nonetheless, further studies are necessary to examine the
   connections between the different elements in the agricultural landscape
   and to understand in depth the response of the pollinator communities.}},

Title = {{Draft genome of Rosenbergiella nectarea strain 8N4(T) provides insights
   into the potential role of this species in its plant host}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Rosenbergiella nectarea strain 8N4(T), the type species of
   the genus Rosenbergiella, was isolated from Amygdalus communis (almond)
   floral nectar. Other strains of this species were isolated from the
   floral nectar of Citrus paradisi (grapefruit), Nicotiana glauca (tobacco
   tree) and from Asphodelus aestivus. R. nectarea strain 8N4(T) is a
   Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacterium in
   the family Enterobacteriaceae.
   Results: Here we describe features of this organism, together with its
   genome sequence and annotation. The DNA GC content is 47.38\%, the
   assembly size is 3,294,717 bp, and the total number of genes are 3,346.
   The genome discloses the possible role that this species may play in the
   plant. The genome contains both virulence genes, like pectin lyase and
   hemolysin, that may harm plant cells and genes that are predicted to
   produce volatile compounds that may impact the visitation rates by
   nectar consumers, such as pollinators and nectar thieves.
   Conclusions: The genome of R. nectarea strain 8N4(T) reveals a
   mutualistic interaction with the plant host and a possible effect on
   plant pollination and fitness.}},

Title = {{A natural hybrid, an autopolyploid, or a new species? An integrative
   case study of a distinctive Costus species (Costaceae) from the Atlantic
   Forest of Brazil}},
Journal = {{SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY}},
Abstract = {{Sixteen species of Costus s.s. are cited to Brazil, all of which can be
   found in the Brazilian Amazon, while only three also grow in the
   Atlantic Forest: C. arabicus, C. scaber, and C. spiralis. Studies of the
   genus from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest evidenced a distinctive fourth
   taxon, similar overall to C. spiralis, which is an ornithophilous
   species, however the flower morphology of this new taxon indicates it to
   be melittophilous. Hybridization and polyploidy (allopolyploidy or
   autopolyploidy) may play a role as an important source for evolutionary
   events, especially in recent speciose lineages such as Neotropical
   Costus. Here we investigated the evolutionary origin of this interesting
   Costus species using an integrative approach. This approach comprised a
   morphological analysis, cytogenetic analyses (chromosome counts,
   CMA/DAPI staining, and fluorescent in situ hybridization), genome size
   estimations, and a molecular phylogenetic reconstruction (using the
   plastid regions rps16 and trnL-F, and the nuclear ITS and ETS), aiming
   to answer the following questions: is it a hybrid?; is it an
   autopolyploid of C. spiralis?; or, if it is a different species, is it
   even phylogenetically related to C. spiralis or C. arabicus? The studies
   performed did not indicate any evidence of polyploidy, however, a
   chromosomal polymorphism was observed between the populations of the
   taxon studied. The phylogenetic position of this peculiar taxon with C.
   erythrophyllus, C. spiralis, and C. varzearum also excludes the putative
   partial heritage of C. arabicus which had been previously hypothesized.
   Our results confirm that it is a new, undescribed species, which is
   confirmed by our morphological observations of floral features. A
   complete taxonomic treatment of the new species is provided, including a
   key for the species of the genus in the Atlantic Forest.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, urbanization and other forms of land use change have been
   implicated in widespread pollinator declines and disruptions to
   plant-pollinator interactions. A growing body of literature, however,
   suggests that urban habitat fragments can provide oases for both plant
   and insect diversity. A micro-ecosystem on our college campus was
   created to represent the longleaf pine savannas (sandhills) that once
   dominated upland ridges throughout the Southeast. To assess the ability
   of this site to support wild insect pollinators, from May through August
   for three years (2016-2018) we compared visitation to two abundant
   flowering plant species, Bidens alba (a generalist-pollinated composite)
   and Chamaecrista fasciculata (a specialist-pollinated legume), between
   the campus micro-ecosystem and a nearby site within a large conservation
   area containing sandhill habitat undergoing restoration. We found that,
   for both plant species, total insect visitation rates did not differ
   between years or sites, suggesting that the small urban fragment is
   capable of maintaining abundant pollinators. The identity of generalist
   visitors to Bidens alba, however, differed dramatically between sites.
   Wild hymenopterans constituted more than two-thirds of all insect visits
   in the campus site but less than half in the conservation area, where
   butterflies, flies, and beetles were also common visitors. The high
   density of flowers in the campus site is likely at least partially
   responsible for the high abundance of hymenopterans, a result consistent
   with that of many other studies showing that hymenopterans are less
   sensitive to urbanization than are other insect groups.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying environmental drivers which structure wild bee species
   assemblages appears essential in a context of worldwide pollinator
   decline. During a two-year survey, we studied wild bee species
   assemblages in an 85km(2) protected area dominated by Mediterranean
   scrubland, the Calanques National Park, located in southern France. Our
   objectives were (i) to assess the composition of the wild bee species
   assemblages, and (ii) to explore the effect of a) land cover composition
   (anthropogenic zone, low scrubland, forest and rocky land cover), b)
   local plant community composition, and c) honeybee colony density on
   wild bee species assemblages. On 17 circular 100m(2) plots, we collected
   541 specimens belonging to 87 wild bee species. We found that large bee
   species were significantly influenced by land cover composition within a
   1000m radius. More specifically, we observed that the presence of a
   diversified land cover composition within a 1000m radius maximized large
   wild bee species richness, whereas large bee abundance and richness were
   negatively affected by honeybee colony density. Small wild bee species
   were structured by the local plant community composition within 100m(2)
   plots and by land cover composition within a 1000m radius. Their
   occurrence were related to the local composition of plants growing on
   deep soils in scrublands. The Calanques National Park, which is the only
   European park located at the interface with a large city and
   consequently suffers from anthropic pressure, encompasses several types
   of land cover which are beneficial for a wide diversity of bees.
   However, we would like to raise awareness among park managers regarding
   beekeeping activities within this territory which includes diverse types
   of land cover favorable for wild bee species.}},

Abstract = {{Urban community gardens are potentially important sites for urban
   pollinator conservation because of their high density, diversity of
   flowering plants, and low pesticide use (relative to agricultural
   spaces). Selective planting of attractive crop plants is a simple and
   cost-effective strategy for attracting flower visitors to urban green
   spaces, however, there is limited empirical data about which plants are
   most attractive. Here, we identified key plant species that were
   important for supporting flower visitors using a network-based approach
   that combined metrics of flower visitor abundance and diversity on
   different crop species. We included a metric of `popularity' which
   assessed how frequently a particular plant appeared within community
   gardens. We also determined the impact of garden characteristics such as
   size, flower species richness, and flower species density on the
   abundance and diversity of flower visitors. Two plant species, Brassica
   rapa and Ocimum basilicum were identified as being particularly
   important species for supporting flower visitor populations. Flower
   species richness had a strong positive effect on both the abundance and
   diversity of flower visitors. We suggest that gardeners can maximise the
   conservation value of their gardens by planting a wide variety of
   flowering plants including attractive plants such as B. rapa and O.
   basilicum.}},

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{196}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{While cities are known as important habitats for wild bees, a conceptual
   understanding of how assemblages of wild bee species are shaped by urban
   environments is limited. We applied a functional approach to test how
   taxonomic and functional diversity within wild bee communities of urban
   grasslands, and traits of bee species, related to local habitat features
   (e.g., management, species richness, flower coverage) and
   characteristics of the surrounding urban matrix (e.g., urbanisation,
   isolation). Surprisingly, urbanisation was not related to any diversity
   measure. Yet, taxonomic and functional diversity in bee communities, and
   proportion of endangered bee species, responded negatively to the
   isolation of grasslands within the urban matrix-but positively to flower
   coverage. Urbanisation, previous restoration efforts and site type
   filtered the functional composition of bee communities in terms of
   species traits related to diet and nesting. Results substantiate the
   role of urban habitats for functionally diverse bee communities,
   including Red-Listed species, and indicate pathways towards enhancing
   habitat functions of urban grasslands for wild bees by (i) improving the
   connectivity of urban grassland patches within the urban matrix, and
   (ii) more locally by adjusting management to maintain flower coverage in
   grasslands. These approaches can support efforts to develop
   pollinator-friendly greenspaces within the urban green infrastructure.}},

Title = {{The contribution of small-scale food production in urban areas to the
   sustainable development goals: a review and case study}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Food production depends upon the adequate provision of underpinning
   ecosystem services, such as pollination. Paradoxically, conventional
   farming practices are undermining these services and resulting in
   degraded soils, polluted waters, greenhouse gas emissions and massive
   loss of biodiversity including declines in pollinators. In essence,
   farming is undermining the ecosystem services it relies upon. Finding
   alternative more sustainable ways to meet growing food demands which
   simultaneously support biodiversity is one of the biggest challenges
   facing humanity. Here, we review the potential of urban and peri-urban
   agriculture to contribute to sustainable food production, using the 17
   sustainable development goals set by the United Nations General Assembly
   as a framework. We present new data from a case study of urban gardens
   and allotments in the city of Brighton and Hove, UK. Such urban and
   peri-urban landholdings tend to be small and labour-intensive,
   characterised by a high diversity of crops including perennials and
   annuals. Our data demonstrate that this type of agricultural system can
   be highly productive and that it has environmental and social advantages
   over industrial agriculture in that crops are usually produced using few
   synthetic inputs and are destined for local consumption. Overall, we
   conclude that food grown on small-scale areas in and near cities is
   making a significant contribution to feeding the world and that this
   type of agriculture is likely to be relatively favourable for some
   ecosystem services, such as supporting healthy soils. However, major
   knowledge gaps remain, for example with regard to productivity, economic
   and employment impacts, pesticide use and the implications for
   biodiversity.}},

Title = {{The associations among the breeding performance of Osmia bicornis L.

   along urbanisation gradient}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{710}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{Urban environments may negatively affect the development of organisms.
   In host-pathogen/parasite systems, this impact may lead to increased
   manifestations of pathogens that decrease the success of their hosts in
   urban environments compared to rural ones. We tested this hypothesis in
   the solitary bee Osmia bicornis L. We estimated the development of bees,
   their reproductive success and the manifestation of different pathogens
   and nest parasites along an urbanisation gradient. We conducted the
   experiment in an urbanisation gradient in sites representing three
   environments: urban, suburban and rural. First, we analysed the
   manifestation of bacterial and fungal microorganisms in pollen loads,
   within dried/mummified individuals, on the surface of cocoons and on the
   surface of diapausing adult individuals by using the MALDI-TOF MS
   technique. We also verified genetic samples from diapausing individuals
   for the presence of the parasitic Nosema apis (Zandler, 1909) and N.
   ceranae (Fries et al., 1996) species. Finally, we assessed the level of
   reproductive success and manifestations of brood parasites. Not any
   biological material from the nests was infected by pathogenic
   microorganisms. This result indicates that the nests are not a reservoir
   of the pathogenic bacteria and that O. bicornis offspring are not a
   source or vectors of these pathogens to the surrounding environment and
   indirectly to other bee species. In urban sites, there was a lower
   number of parasites than in suburban and rural environments. The
   presence of parasites was negatively correlated with the reproductive
   success and may be a limiting factor for O. bicornis populations. We
   also found that urban sites had the highest indices of reproductive
   success and the lowest number of breeding failures compared to suburban
   and rural sites. Moreover, bacterial and fungal transmission is not a
   serious threat in the studied region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Spatial and temporal variation of potential resource availability
   provided by street trees in southeastern Brazil}},
Journal = {{URBAN ECOSYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{Street trees provide several ecosystem services in urban areas,
   including food for fauna. Tree species richness, composition and the
   relative abundance of native vs. non-native species can affect the
   populations of pollinators and dispersers. This work aims to evaluate
   the potential availability of food resources provided by street trees,
   in space and time, considering different pollination and seed dispersal
   syndromes at Santo Andre city (Southeastern Brazil). The georeferenced
   data for all catalogued tree individuals in the Urban Macrozone
   constituted our sampling domain. The species were categorized according
   to its geographical origin, pollination and seed dispersal syndromes,
   flowering and fruiting season. We divided the study area into cells and
   calculated: number of individuals, species richness, species diversity;
   richness and diversity of potentially flowering and fruiting individuals
   in each season of the year. 38,379 trees were catalogued, representing
   578 trees/km(2), totalizing 230 species. Most individuals (73\%) were
   non-native. The number of individuals, species richness and diversity
   varied spatially. The pollination syndrome with higher potential
   resources availability was melittophily (pollination by bees and wasps)
   has during spring whereas ornithochory (seed dispersal by birds) was the
   dispersal syndrome with higher potential resources availability which
   occurred in summer. Despite the dominance of exotic individuals, the
   most common syndromes are in accordance with what is expected for
   tropical Atlantic rainforest regions. However, some pollination and
   dispersal syndromes presented very low potential resource availability
   in different seasons and no availability in some regions. These results
   should be taken into account by stakeholders for a better planning of
   planting efforts, considering the distribution, in space and time, of
   the potential availability of resources provided by street trees to
   fauna in order to improve connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Corymbia citriodora is one of the most cultivated hardwood species by
   small farmers in Brazil, and the most traded wood on the east coast of
   Australia due its high growth rate combined with high wood density. The
   study of genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) is one of the most
   critical elements in the management of a breeding program to define
   breeding zones and to select genetic material targeted to specific
   environmental conditions. The aim of this research was to estimate
   genetic parameters in a C. citriodora progeny tests, established using
   56 open-pollinated families in three sites with contrasting soil texture
   within the Luiz Antonio's experimental station, Brazil. The following
   traits were measured at 30 years of age: total height, diameter at
   breast height (DBH), stem form and survival. Based on this data, the
   individual volume was estimated. The harmonic mean relative performance
   of genetic values (MHPRVG) predicted by BLUP was used to evaluate
   productivity, stability and adaptability. The GEI was found to be not
   significant in all growth traits. A complex GEI was detected only for
   survival, supporting the importance of choosing the right genetic
   material of the species to specific sites. The present analysis showed a
   significant difference between families for DBH, survival and volume. In
   summary, the material studied presents potential to obtain attractive
   genetic gains through selection. However, in order to keep these
   sustained gains over the next selection cycles it is necessary to
   incorporate new genetic materials in order to increase genetic
   diversity.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{Native bees provide essential pollination services in both natural and
   managed ecosystems. However, declines in native bee species highlight
   the need for increased understanding of land management methods that can
   promote healthy, persistent populations and diverse communities. This
   can be challenging and costly using traditional scientific methods, but
   citizen science can overcome many limitations. In this study, we
   examined the distribution and abundance of an agriculturally important
   wild bee species, the squash bee (Eucera (Peponapis) pruinosa,
   Hymenoptera: Apidae). They are ground nesting, specialist bees that
   depend on cultivated varieties of Cucurbita (squash, pumpkins, gourds).
   The intimate relationship between squash bees and their host plants
   suggests that they are likely sensitive to farm management practices,
   particularly those that disturb the soil. In this study, citizen
   scientists across Michigan used a survey to submit field management and
   bee observation data. Survey results indicated that squash bees occupy a
   wide geographic range and are more abundant in farms with reduced soil
   disturbance. Citizen science provided an inexpensive and effective
   method for examining impacts of farm management practices on squash bees
   and could be a valuable tool for monitoring and conserving other native
   pollinators.}},

Title = {{Creating urban green infrastructure where it is needed - A spatial
   ecosystem service-based decision analysis of green roofs in Barcelona}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{707}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{As cities face increasing pressure from densification trends, green
   roofs represent a valuable source of ecosystem services for residents of
   compact metropolises where available green space is scarce. However, to
   date little research has been conducted regarding the holistic benefits
   of green roofs at a citywide scale, with local policymakers lacking
   practical guidance to inform expansion of green roofs coverage. The
   study addresses this issue by developing a spatial multi-criteria
   screening tool applied in Barcelona, Spain to determine: 1) where green
   roofs should be prioritized in Barcelona based on expert elicited demand
   for a wide range of ecosystem services and 2) what type of design of
   potential green roofs would optimize the ecosystem service provision. As
   inputs to the model, fifteen spatial indicators were selected as proxies
   for ecosystem service deficits and demands (thermal regulation, runoff
   control, habitat and pollination, food production, recreation, and
   social cohesion) along with five decision alternatives for green roof
   design (extensive, semi-intensive, intensive, naturalized, and
   allotment). These indicators and alternatives were analyzed
   probabilistically and spatially, then weighted according to feedback
   from local experts. Results of the assessment indicate that there is
   high demand across Barcelona for the ecosystem services that green roofs
   potentially might provide, particularly in dense residential
   neighborhoods and the industrial south. Experts identified habitat,
   pollination and thermal regulation as the most needed ES with runoff
   control and food production as the least demanded. Naturalized roofs
   generated the highest potential ecosystem service provision levels for
   87.5\% of rooftop area, apart from smaller areas of central Barcelona
   where intensive rooftops were identified as the preferable green roof
   design. Overall, the spatial model developed in this study offers a
   flexible screening based on spatial multi-criteria decision analysis
   that can be easily adjusted to guide municipal policy in other cities
   considering the effectiveness of green infrastructure as source of
   ecosystem services. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Bee community response to local and landscape factors along an
   urban-rural gradient}},
Journal = {{URBAN ECOSYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{Over a third of the world's crops require insect pollination, and
   reliance on pollination services for food continues to rise as human
   populations increase. Furthermore, as interest in urban agriculture has
   grown, so has a need for studies of urban pollinator ecology and
   pollination. Analyzing pollinator assemblages along a rural-urban
   gradient provides powerful mechanistic insight into how urbanization
   impacts pollinators. Yet, studies examining pollinators along
   urban-rural gradients are limited and results vary. Since pollinators
   vary tremendously in life history characteristics and respond to
   urbanization differently, studies from different regions would improve
   our understanding of pollinator response to urbanization. This study
   documents different bee assemblages along a high-plains semi-arid
   urban-rural gradient in Denver, Colorado, USA. Percent impervious
   surface was used to define the extent of urbanization at 12 sites and
   local and landscape characteristics were estimated using field
   assessments and geospatial analysis. Wild bees were collected and the
   relationships between urbanization and bee communities were explored
   using linear modeling. Overall, bee abundance and diversity decreased
   with increasing urbanization, suggesting that urban areas negatively
   impact bee communities. However, all bee guilds responded positively to
   local floral richness and negatively to the degree of landscape
   urbanization, suggesting that different types of bees responded
   similarly to urbanization. These findings suggest that providing a
   greater diversity of floral resources is key to mitigating the negative
   impacts of urbanization on pollinator communities.}},

Title = {{Floral visitors in urban gardens and natural areas: Diversity and

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{3-15}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Because cities concentrate 50\% of the worlds population, and are
   experiencing a re-emergence of urban agriculture, we investigated the
   influences of urban agriculture and surrounding natural areas on floral
   visitors (bees, wasps, butterflies and flies) and plant species in San
   Cristobal de Las Casas, Mexico.
   Throughout the frost, dry and rainy seasons of 2015, we sampled floral
   visitors in nine urban gardens and nine natural areas. We found 210
   floral visitor species: 78\% pollinators, 18\% predators, and 4\%
   florivores. Rarefaction curves showed that natural areas harbor
   significantly more floral visitor species (148) than home gardens (132).
   However, the differences in species composition between habitats and
   seasons highlight the need to view natural areas and home gardens as
   complementary habitats with which floral visitors interact in varying
   ways, during successive seasons, to meet different needs. Furthermore,
   mean species richness of floral visitors was influenced mainly by
   seasonality, and increased as seasons progressed from the dry, frost
   season to the rainy season. Nonetheless, some taxa were influenced by
   both season and habitat type. Floral visitor abundance was influenced by
   both habitat type and season, with home gardens showing higher abundance
   across seasons. Moreover, interaction networks for each season were more
   asymmetric in natural areas than in home gardens. Urban cover in the
   surrounding landscape influenced in a quadratic way the species number
   of floral visitors, but not their abundance. Thus, our results are
   evidence that natural areas surrounding cities and urban agriculture
   contribute to floral visitor communities and their networks. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Global pollinator declines have stimulated efforts to better understand
   local pollinator diversity. Urban greenspaces, such as parks and
   gardens, have the potential to serve as refuges for pollinators within
   urban landscapes. In this study, we surveyed bees within the University
   of Alabama (UA) Arboretum, a mixed-use park of roughly 24 ha, and the
   contiguous UA Harry Pritchett Running Park, a former golf course of
   roughly 57 ha, within the city of Tuscaloosa, AL. To investigate how
   heterogeneity within this small greenspace influences bee community
   structure, we distributed sample sites across 3 habitats, each with
   unique total area, land-use characteristics, vegetation, and management
   intensity. We combined morphological identification with molecular
   approaches for specimen identification using cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I sequences to create a specimen + DNA barcode reference
   collection. Overall, we collected 386 bees and 42 species. Diversity was
   partitioned across habitats, suggesting that the community was
   structured by variation in landscape characteristics. Our results
   suggest ways in which urban pollinator refuges may be managed to enhance
   species diversity, such as by retention of unmowed areas and planting
   permanent gardens supporting diverse floral resources. Importantly, this
   survey sets a baseline for developing broader monitoring programs within
   the largely unstudied region of central Alabama.}},

Journal = {{PROTOPLASMA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{257}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Floral nectaries are important components of floral architecture and
   significant taxonomic traits facilitating assessment of relationships
   between taxa and can contribute substantially to studies on the ecology
   and evolution of a particular genus. Knowledge of nectary structure and
   functioning allows better understanding of the mutualistic interactions
   between the pollinator and the plant. Robinia viscosa var. hartwigii
   (Hartweg's locust), planted in many European countries as an ornamental
   plant and used for recovery of degraded areas and urban arborisation, is
   a valuable melliferous species often visited by honeybees and
   bumblebees. The aim of this study was to investigate the microstructure
   of the floral nectaries of R. viscosa var. hartwigii with the use of
   light, fluorescence, scanning, and transmission electron microscopes.
   The photosynthetic nectaries were located on the inner surface of the
   cup-like receptacle. The components of pre-nectar were synthesised in
   the chloroplasts of the glandular parenchyma and transported via the
   conducting elements of the phloem. Nectar was released through modified
   nectarostomata. Nectar secretion presumably proceeded in the eccrine
   mode, whereas nectar transport represented the symplastic and apoplastic
   types. The cuticle on the nectary epidermis surface contained lipids,
   essentials oils, and flavonoids, while proteins and flavonoids were
   present in the glandular parenchyma cells. Idioblasts containing
   phenolic compounds, tannins, and polysaccharides were observed between
   the glandular parenchyma cells. The location of the nectaries and the
   mode of nectar production in the flowers of the Hartweg's locust follow
   the common location and structure pattern characteristic for the
   nectaries in some members of the subfamily Papilionoideae and can be a
   significant taxonomic trait for the genus Robinia and the tribe
   Robinieae.}},

Title = {{Antifungal activity of different essential oils against Malassezia
   pathogenic species}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{249}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Plants produce essential oils in
   response to physiological stresses, pathogen attacks and ecological
   factors. Nowadays, they are recognized as defence compounds and
   attractors of pollinators. Essential oils have been traditionally used
   in the past years in various cultures for medicinal and health purposes.
   In recent times due to their well-documented antimicrobial activities,
   essential oils have consolidated their use in raw and processed food
   preservation, health and clinical uses.
   Aims of the review: The potential activity of essential oils against the
   largely diffused Malassezia species on the human skin, which can cause
   common infections or exacerbate multiple skin disorders, such as P.
   versicolor, folliculitis, seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff, atopic
   dermatitis and psoriasis.
   Materials and methods: Information on essential oils activity against
   Malassezia species was obtained from published materials, including
   books and electronic databases, such as SCI finder, PubMed, Web of
   Science, ACS, Science Direct, Wiley, Springer, Taylor, J-STAGE and
   Google Scholar. Search was conducted covering the period from January
   2013 to December 2018.
   Results: In the in vitro studies diverse methods were used to test the
   essential oils activity, namely broth microdilution method, which
   resulted the most used one, followed by agar disk diffusion and vapour
   phase methods. Essential oils obtained by steam distillation were from
   different plant genera, Thymus, Artemisia, Malaleuca, Cinnamomun,
   Ocimum, Zataria, Rosmarinus, Origanum, Syzigium, Foenicolum, Thapsia,
   T'achyspernium, Myrtus. MIC values were expressed as mu g/mL, mu L/mL
   and by inhibition zone (mm) or mu L/cm(3). All the investigated
   essential oils were active at the tested conditions. In addition, two
   clinical studies used essential oils from Cymbopogon citratus and C.
   flexuosus formulated in shampoo, cream or lotion for the successful
   treatment of dandruff and P. versicolor.
   Conclusions: Results of these studies indicate worthy prospects for
   clinical application of essential oils and there is an urgent need to
   conduct further in vivo studies with large number of patients in order
   to verify the clinical potential of essential oils against Malassezia
   species.}},

Title = {{Variation in pollinator-mediated plant reproduction across an
   urbanization gradient}},
Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Abstract = {{Urbanization alters the landscape, degrades and fragments habitats, and
   can have a profound effect on species interactions. Plant-pollinator
   networks may be particularly sensitive to urbanization, because plants
   and their insect pollinators have been shown to respond to urbanization
   both positively and negatively. To better understand the relationship
   between urbanization, pollinator behavior, and season on
   pollinator-mediated plant reproduction, we created 30 experimental plant
   populations along an urbanization gradient in the Greater Toronto Area,
   Canada. To test how urbanization affects plant reproduction and
   between-patch pollen dispersal, we created a standard hermaphroditic
   plant patch at each site, and a male-sterile plant patch at a subset of
   sites. We measured plant reproduction in the early and late summer in
   each of 2 years. Plants in urban sites produced significantly fewer
   flowers than plants in the nonurban sites, whereas seed number per plant
   either increased or decreased with urbanization, depending on the
   season. Experimental populations in urban sites also exhibited reduced
   pollen dispersal between patches. Pollen dispersal between patches was
   greatest early in the summer and declined with increased impervious
   surface and proximity to the city. Together, our results are likely
   caused by variation in environmental conditions and pollinator services
   across the urban gradient, resulting in pollen limitation and pollen
   dispersal differences among sites. Our work adds to the small but
   growing body of literature on urban plant-pollinator interactions and
   suggests that responses to urbanization are context-dependent.}},

Title = {{Evolution of self-compatibility by a mutant S-m-RNase in citrus}},
Journal = {{NATURE PLANTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{131-142}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism that prevents
   self-fertilization and inbreeding in flowering plants. The most
   widespread SI system utilizes S ribonucleases (S-RNases) and S-locus
   F-boxes (SLFs) as S determinants. In citrus, SI is ancestral, and Citrus
   maxima (pummelo) is self-incompatible, while Citrus reticulata
   (mandarin) and its hybrids are self-compatible (SC). Here, we identify
   nine highly polymorphic pistil-specific, developmentally expressed
   S-RNases from pummelo that segregate with S haplotypes in a gametophytic
   manner and cluster with authentic S-RNases. We provide evidence that
   these S-RNases function as the female S determinants in citrus.
   Moreover, we show that each S-RNase is linked to approximately nine
   SLFs. In an analysis of 117 citrus SLF and SFL-like (SLFL) genes, we
   reveal that they cluster into 12 types and that the S-RNases and
   intra-haplotypic SLF and SLFL genes co-evolved. Our data support the
   notion that citrus have a S locus comprising a S-RNase and several SLFs
   that fit the non-self-recognition model. We identify a predominant
   single nucleotide mutation, S-m-RNase, in SC citrus, which provides a
   `natural' loss of function. We show that SI-SC transitions due to the
   S-m-RNase initially arose in mandarin, spreading to its hybrids and
   became fixed. Identification of an evolutionarily distant new genus
   utilizing the S-RNase-based SI system, >100 million years separated from
   the nearest S-RNase family, is a milestone for evolutionary comparative
   studies.}},

Title = {{Impact of Tree Pollen Distribution on Allergic Diseases in Serbia:
   Evidence of Implementation of Allergen Immunotherapy to Betula verrucosa}},
Journal = {{MEDICINA-LITHUANIA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background and objectives: The relationship between air pollen quantity
   and the sensitization of allergic patients is crucial for both the
   diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases. Weather conditions
   influence the distribution of allergenic pollen and increases in pollen
   concentration may negatively affect the health of allergic patients. The
   aim of this study was to analyze the implementation of allergen
   immunotherapy with regard to air pollen concentration. Material and
   Methods: Here we examined the relationship between Betula air pollen
   concentration and the usage of Betula verrucosa allergen immunotherapy
   in Serbia. Examination covered the period from 2015 to 2018. Measurement
   of airborne pollen concentration was performed with Lanzoni volumetric
   pollen traps. The evidence of the usage of sublingual allergen
   immunotherapy (SLIT) was gathered from patients with documented
   sensitization to specific pollen. Results: During this period tree
   pollens were represented with 58\% +/- 21\% of all measured air pollen
   species, while Betula pollen represented 15\% +/- 8\% of all tree
   pollens. Betula pollination peaked in April. Allergen immunotherapy to
   Betula verrucosa in Serbia is entirely conducted as sublingual
   immunotherapy and represents 47.1\% +/- 1.4\% of issued tree pollen
   SLIT. The use of pollen SLIT increased by 68\% from 2015 to 2018, with
   an even greater increase in usage recorded for Betula SLIT-80\%.
   Conclusions: This analysis shows a clear causative relationship between
   pollination and the type/prevalence of applied allergen immunotherapy.
   Information about the flowering seasons of allergenic plants is very
   important for people who suffer from allergy, for clinical
   allergologists, as well as for governing authorities. The presented data
   is of practical importance to the proper timing of immunotherapy
   initiation and of importance for urban landscaping. The obtained data
   can be the starting point for the instatement of a thorough
   epidemiological study and the inclusion of Serbia on the pollen map of
   Europe.}},

Journal = {{INSECTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Multiple interacting stressors negatively affect the survival and
   productivity of managed honey bee colonies. Pesticides remain a primary
   concern for beekeepers, as even sublethal exposures can reduce bee
   immunocompetence, impair navigation, and reduce social communication.
   Pollinator protection focuses on pesticide application guidelines;
   however, a more active protection strategy is needed. One possible
   approach is the use of feeding deterrents that can be delivered as an
   additive during pesticide application. The goal of this study was to
   validate a laboratory assay designed to rapidly screen compounds for
   behavioral changes related to feeding or feeding deterrence. The results
   of this investigation demonstrated that the synthetic Nasonov pheromone
   and its terpenoid constituents citral, nerol, and geraniol could alter
   feeding behavior in a laboratory assay. Additionally, electroantennogram
   assays revealed that these terpenoids elicited some response in the
   antennae; however, only a synthetic Nasonov pheromone, citral, and
   geraniol elicited responses that differed significantly from control and
   vehicle detections.}},

Abstract = {{In the recent years, the number of insect pollinators has declined
   significantly. This, on the one hand, is explained by urbanization,
   which reduces the blooming resources available to pollinators and on the

   Considering this, the preservation and restoration of plant strips in
   and around arable land is essential to provide a wide variety of
   flowering species, which serve as food resources, nesting and hibernate
   sites for pollinators.
   With the aim of associating the earlier pollinators in the crop, it was
   betting field experience with different grass mixtures of different
   species composition, and time of sowing at the Experimental field of the
   Agricultural University in Plovdiv, Bulgaria.
   From 1055 numbers of pollinators registered in grass mixtures, the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{49-63}},

Abstract = {{Determination of the factors influencing the population structure and
   adaptive tolerance to environmental pressures of the synanthropic
   hoverfly Eristalis arbustorum is of essential importance in
   understanding how pollinator populations could respond to climate change
   or ecosystem management. We addressed the issue of connectivity among
   conspecific populations sampled in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Twenty
   environmental factors, mitochondrial DNA sequences of the cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit I gene (COI mtDNA), allele frequencies at allozyme loci
   and wing traits (size and shape) were compared for characterization of
   population structure and environmental niches. Additionally, patterns of
   within-individual asymmetry (fluctuating asymmetry; FA) in wing size and
   shape within and among conspecific populations were studied. In line
   with the overall similarity of the environmental factors extracted for
   our study sites, the results of COI mtDNA diversity and STRUCTURE
   allozyme data provide evidence for shallow differentiation among
   conspecific populations. In contrast, geo-referenced Bayesian clustering
   methods (BAPS and GENELAND) and population-based approaches (pairwise
   F-ST values and AMOVA) indicate that the dispersal potential of E.
   arbustorum may be limited across the study area. Along with a
   significant FA in wing size and shape, a consistent level of FA
   regardless of urban/rural sampling origin is an indication of the great
   potential of E. arbustorum for local adaptation, because increased FA
   levels can be considered to be a way of expression of phenotypic
   variation and, hence, may contribute to adaptive responses in
   populations facing changing environments. Thus, by using a combined
   genetic-morphological approach, we significantly contributed to the
   understanding of the fine-scale genetic structure of the synanthropic
   generalist pollinator E. arbustorum.}},

   surveys we analyzed the dietary preferrences of 17 species from the
   Bombus genus living in urban areas. We analyzed plants for their
   taxonomy, type and status in Central Europe, flower colours and shapes.
   We found out that the preferred plants for most bumblebee species are
   perennial and native plants, with violet/pink flowers with
   papilionaceous or bilabiate structure. We suggest that such plant
   species should be planted in ubran spaces in order to actively protect
   bumblebees. Moreover, it is important to consider less common bumblebee
   species, with a narrower specialization and different dietary
   requirements. For this group of bees we suggest flowers with longer
   corollas, especialy those from Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Boraginaceae,
   Plantaginaceae and Ranunculaceae families.}},

Abstract = {{Ornamental flowers are commonly planted in urban and suburban areas to
   provide foraging resources for pollinator populations. However, their
   role in supporting broad pollinator biodiversity is not well established
   as previous studies have been conducted in urban landscapes with
   pollinator communities that are distinct from those in natural systems.
   We observed pollinator visitation patterns to five ornamental annual
   plant genera and their cultivars over multiple years at two semi-natural
   sites in Pennsylvania to understand their potential for supporting
   diverse pollinator communities. There was significant variation in
   visitor abundance and diversity by season and year for many annual
   ornamental cultivars. Within some genera, cultivars had similar visitor
   abundance, diversity, and main visitor taxa, while cultivars in other
   genera varied greatly in these measures. We observed only polylectic
   (pollen generalist) bee species visiting annual ornamentals, despite the
   presence of oligolectic (pollen specialist) bee species in the
   background population. We conclude that the attractiveness of annual
   ornamental plants likely depends on both cultivar characteristics and
   environmental context. While their role in supporting complex pollinator
   populations is limited both based on the number of and dietary breadth
   of the species they support, ornamental plants may nonetheless provide
   long-lasting supplemental foraging resources for the generalist
   pollinator communities characteristic of urban and suburban
   environments.}},

Title = {{Using AHP and PROMETHEE multi-criteria decision making methods to define
   suitable apiary locations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Beekeeping activities have a rapidly increasing importance due to their
   derived products and their contributions to human health, biodiversity,
   agriculture, and pollination. Moreover, beekeeping can play a major role
   in supporting rural development and bringing the benefits of sustainable
   developments and productivity. Thus, the decision on correct apiary
   locations via suitability analysis techniques seems essential to sustain
   and increase the yield and efficiency. However, this decision-making
   process requires a large number of parameters including the topography
   of the field surrounding environment and climate conditions. At this
   point, Multi Criteria Decision Analysis techniques can provide efficient
   solutions for decision making on suitable apiary locations. In this
   study, suitable apiary site selection analysis for beekeeping activities
   via Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and The Preference Ranking
   Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE) methods
   was proposed for Konya city located in Central Anatolia as a pilot
   application. Aspect, elevation, slope, flora, water resources, roads,
   railroads, settlements, electricity lines, buildings, precipitation, and
   natural disaster area criteria were assessed to generate beekeeping
   suitability for apiaries. The restrictions and requirements of
   beekeeping activities were specified considering expert beekeeper
   decisions and recent studies for the study area. The AHP and PROMETHEE
   suitability maps were validated with existing 461 apiary locations to be
   able to determine the reliability and applicability.}},

Title = {{A Comparative Ontogenetic Approach to Understanding the Pseudomonomerous
   Gynoecium in Moraceae}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{181}},
Number = {{2, SI}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Premise of research. Moraceae, the well-known mulberry or fig family,
   displays small, inconspicuous, diclinous flowers that are very different
   from many other rosids. One remarkable condition is the gynoecium that
   is unilocular and uniovulate but composed of two carpels, characterizing
   a type of pseudomonomery. The pathways that lead to the formation of
   such a pseudomonomerous gynoecium are insufficiently known. Therefore,
   the objective of the present study was to elucidate the developmental
   pathways of this intriguing type of gynoecium in six species
   representing six of seven tribes recognized in Moraceae: Brosimum
   gaudichaudii, Castilla elastica, Clarisia ilicifolia, Ficus citrifolia,
   Maclura tinctoria, and Morus nigra. Methodology. Buds at different
   stages of development and flowers were processed for surface and
   anatomical studies. Pivotal results. The gynoecium meristem forms at
   first a single protuberance in the center of the flower, which then
   divides, originating two carpels that elongate asymmetrically, but only
   one initiates an ovule. After elongation of the young carpels,
   significant differences are found: (1) the two carpels take part in
   ovary, style, and stigma formation, although only one initiates an ovule
   in the ovary, and (2) the longer carpel contains an ovule, whereas the
   smaller carpel is simply a component of the ovary (M. tinctoria). The
   developed ovary of all species is vascularized by two dorsal traces,
   attesting to the participation of two carpels. All species except M.
   tinctoria have two stigmatic branches that, at the time of receptivity,
   may differ in length. Conclusions. The formation of a pseudomonomerous
   gynoecium in Moraceae is a condition of carpel dimorphism that manifests
   itself along an ontogenetic gradient. Such a gradient is evident in the
   stigma formation, which may involve both carpels, ovulate or not,
   resulting in symmetrical stigmatic branches or in asymmetrical stigmatic
   branches, with the shortening or complete absence of one branch. The
   structure of the pseudomonomerous gynoecium may be the reflection of a
   balance between the decrease in the number of ovules and the increase
   and/or maintenance of the equivalent stigmatic surface.}},

   record collected by citizen volunteers}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Phenological modification is one of the most serious effects of global
   warming on ecosystems with clear seasonality, such as alpine ecosystems
   in mid- to high latitudes. Changes in flowering time and duration in
   plant communities are likely to influence plant-pollinator interactions.
   However, the effects of global warming on community-scale phenology have
   scarcely been studied in alpine ecosystems. I analyzed the flowering
   records of fellfield and snowbed communities collected over a nine-year
   period in the Taisetau Mountains of northern Japan. The flowering
   structure of alpine communities is composed of a flowering sequence of
   early-blooming fellfield species (FE), late-blooming fellfield species
   (FL), and snowbed species. Flowering initiation in FE showed small
   interannual variation, while peak flowering time was accelerated
   according to warmer temperature. Both the initiation and peak flowering
   time of FL depended on heat sum during early summer. The flowering
   period of fellfield communities was shortened under warmer conditions,
   and 1 degrees C warming thought to shorten the major flowering period by
   3.8 days. The flowering initiation of snowbed plants strongly depended
   on snowmelt time, and the peak flowering time further advanced in warmer
   summers. However, the major flowering period of snowbed communities was
   independent of snowmelt time and thermal conditions because many snowbed
   species shifted flowering onset days with little changes in flowering
   period. As a result, the total flowering period of alpine plant
   communities was largely determined by snowmelt time, independent of
   thermal conditions. It is predicted that a 10-day earlier snowmelt will
   shorten the total flowering season by 4.8 days and a 10-day later
   snowmelt will extend the total flowering season by 5.8 days. Therefore,
   snowmelt regime is a major determinant factor of the flowering structure
   of alpine ecosystems. Clarification of snowmelt dynamics is crucial to
   predict the global warming impacts on the phenology of alpine
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Global insect pollinator declines have prompted habitat restoration
   efforts, including pollinator-friendly gardening. Gardens can provide
   nectar and pollen for adult insects and offer reproductive resources,
   such as nesting sites and caterpillar host plants. We conducted a review
   and meta-analysis to examine how decisions made by gardeners on plant
   selection and garden maintenance influence pollinator survival,
   abundance, and diversity. We also considered characteristics of
   surrounding landscapes and the impacts of pollinator natural enemies.
   Our results indicated that pollinators responded positively to high
   plant species diversity, woody vegetation, garden size, and sun exposure
   and negatively to the separation of garden habitats from natural sites.
   Within-garden features more strongly influenced pollinators than
   surrounding landscape factors. Growing interest in gardening for
   pollinators highlights the need to better understand how gardens
   contribute to pollinator conservation and how some garden
   characteristics can enhance the attractiveness and usefulness of gardens
   to pollinators. Further studies examining pollinator reproduction,
   resource acquisition, and natural enemies in gardens and comparing
   gardens with other restoration efforts and to natural habitats are
   needed to increase the value of human-made habitats for pollinators.}},

Title = {{Conservation value of small reserves}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{66-79}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The importance of large reserves has been long maintained in the
   scientific literature, often leading to dismissal of the conservation
   potential of small reserves. However, over half the global
   protected-area inventory is composed of protected areas that are <100
   ha, and the median size of added protected area is decreasing. Studies
   of the conservation value of small reserves and fragments of natural
   area are relatively uncommon in the literature. We reviewed SCOPUS and
   WOK for studies on small reserve and fragment contributions to
   biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, and fifty-eight
   taxon-specific studies were included in the review. Small reserves
   harbored substantial portions (upward of 50\%) of regional species
   diversity for many taxa (birds, plants, amphibians, and small mammals)
   and even some endemic, specialist bird species. Unfortunately, small
   reserves and fragments almost always harbored more generalist and exotic
   species than large reserves. Community composition depended on habitat
   quality, surrounding land use (agricultural vs. urban), and reserve and
   fragment size, which presents opportunities for management and
   improvement. Small reserves also provided ecosystem services, such as
   pollination and biological pest control, and cultural services, such as
   recreation and improved human health. Limitations associated with small
   reserves, such as extinction debt and support of area-sensitive species,
   necessitate a complement of larger reserves. However, we argue that
   small reserves can make viable and significant contributions to
   conservation goals directly as habitat and indirectly by increasing
   landscape connectivity and quality to the benefit of large reserves. To
   effectively conserve biodiversity for future generations in landscapes
   fragmented by human development, small reserves and fragments must be
   included in conservation planning.}},

Title = {{Impacts of dietary supplementation with p-coumaric acid and
   indole-3-acetic acid on survival and biochemical response of honey bees
   treated with tau-fluvalinate}},
Journal = {{ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{189}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Pollinator populations are in decline worldwide. Multiple factors have
   been cited as potential causes to these declines. In honey bees, a
   combination of stressors is known to cause colony losses. Adequate
   nutrition is a key factor for honey bee growth and colony development.
   Several studies show that the nutritional quality of the diet is
   directly proportional to the ability of the bee to face challenges or
   stressors. We explored the effect of p-coumaric (600 mu M) and
   indole-3-acetic acid (2, 20 or 200 mu M) supplementation on the survival
   and activity of key detoxification enzymes of honey bees exposed to
   tau-fluvalinate. The dietary supplementation with p-coumaric and
   indole-3-acetic acids (20 mu M) enhanced the survival of bees exposed to
   tau-fluvalinate (approximately 20\%). We also showed that dietary
   p-coumaric acid increased the levels of cytochrome P450 and glutathione
   reductase activity in bees treated with tau-fluvalinate, as well as in
   the untreated controls, while glutathione-S-transferase activity was
   lower in treated bees than in untreated. In bees fed with
   indole-3-acetic acid, cytochrome P450 showed increased levels, however,
   glutathione-S-transferase showed the lowest activity. Moreover, the
   results showed that supplementation with p-coumaric and indole-3-acetic
   acids did not alter acetyl cholinesterase activity, nor did treatment
   with tau-fluvalinate. Altogether, the enzymatic changes related to the
   detoxification mechanisms observed in bees that were fed with p-coumaric
   and indole-3-acetic acids could be responsible for the increased
   survival of bees treated with tau-fluvalinate compared to those that
   received a control diet. The results presented in this study, together
   with previous studies, provide evidence of the importance of dietary
   phytochemicals in the response of honey bees to pesticide exposure.
   Moreover, these results are the first report of the beneficial effect of
   the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid on the survival of honey bees
   treated with tau-fluvalinate.}},

Title = {{Autecology of the common fishtail palm, Caryota mitis (Arecaceae), in
   Singapore}},
Journal = {{BOTANY LETTERS}},
Abstract = {{The only Caryota species native to Singapore, C. mitis is an important
   ecological resource for a diversity of fauna. However, little is known
   about the autecology of this charismatic, commonly cultivated palm. This
   is the first study that focuses on the autecology of C. mitis in
   Singapore, investigating the following ecological attributes: (1) their
   population demography; (2) differences in densities of C. mitis
   individuals between forest edges and interiors, and different vegetation
   types in secondary forests of Singapore; (3) fruit set; and (4) resource
   utilization for food and shelter by fauna in Singapore. Our results
   demonstrate that C. mitis thrives under disturbance, with significantly
   more individuals found in highly disturbed vegetation type, and more
   juveniles to adults along forest edges compared to the interior. Fruit
   set of C. mitis was estimated to be 31.88\%, with each infructescence
   producing on average 805 fruits (n= 15). Eighteen species of insects
   over four orders (Hymenoptera; Coleoptera; Lepidoptera; and Hemiptera)
   were observed to utilize C. mitis for either food or shelter, and camera
   trapping (n = 562 trap nights) revealed five vertebrate taxa foraging on
   the fruits - pink-necked green pigeon (Treron vernans), oriental pied
   hornbill (Anthracoceros albirostris), common palm civet (Paradoxurus
   musangus), long-tailed macaque (Macaca fasicularis) and plantain
   squirrel (Calloscirurus notatus). The ecological importance of C. mitis
   in maintaining food resources in the highly fragmented landscape of
   Singapore has important implications in reforestation and rehabilitation
   efforts in the region, considering their potential to thrive in
   disturbed habitats and along forest edges.}},

Title = {{Pollen preference of stingless bees (Melipona rufiventris and M.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Rio de Janeiro city presents one of the biggest urban forests today
   comprising several types of vegetation, highlighting the Atlantic
   tropical rainforest. Maintenance of these ecosystems requires protection
   and strong and efficient pollination. The stingless bees are between its
   main pollinators. The present investigation aims to recognize and to
   compare the pollen source preference and competition between Melipona
   rufiventris and Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides in the Parque
   Nacional da Tijuca (PNT) urban forest at Rio de Janeiro. Bee pollen
   pellets were collected and prepared without the use of acetolysis.
   Evaluation intended the comparison of the taxon percentages of pollen
   grains collected by the bees in the same morning time. Dominant plant
   species were of Alchornea, Eucalyptus, Mimosa caesalpiniifolia, Mimosa
   scabrella, Melastomataceae, Myrcia and Solanum. The favorite sources of
   the two bee species in collecting pollen in the rainforest of the PNT
   were partially distinct among them. Therefore, an overlapping of
   harvesting sources was not so frequent during a year. In this respect,
   the forest needs several species of bees for pollination and
   perpetuation.}},

Title = {{Urbanization homogenizes the interactions of plant-frugivore bird
   networks}},
Journal = {{URBAN ECOSYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{Anthropogenic activities are the main cause of habitat loss and
   fragmentation, which directly affects biodiversity. Disruption in
   landscape connectivity among populations may affect complex interactions
   between species and ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed
   dispersal, and ultimately result in secondary extinctions. Urbanization,
   one of the most intense forms of landscapes changes, has been reported
   to negatively affect bird and plant diversity. Still, little is known
   about the effects of urban landscapes on interaction networks. We
   investigated the relationship between urban landscape structure and
   plant-frugivore networks at different spatial scales. Coupling
   interaction data from urban areas and a model selection approach, we
   evaluated which landscape factors best explained the variation in urban
   networks properties. Our results indicate that urbanization decreases
   bird richness, mainly through the loss of habitat specialist species,
   which results in networks being composed mainly of birds well adapted to
   urban dwelling. We found that interaction evenness, a measure of
   homogeneity of interaction distribution between species, increases with
   urbanization. This is due to the strong dominance that generalist birds
   had in network composition because they foraged on all available fruits,
   including exotic plants. The ensuing homogenization of interactions can
   reduce the resilience of networks and affect the efficiency of
   ecosystems functions. Thus, urbanization plans should consider the
   proportion and distribution of green areas within cities, coupling human
   and ecosystem wellbeing.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{In urban and suburban landscapes characterized by extensive designed
   greenspaces, the support of pollinator communities hinges significantly
   on floral resources provided by ornamental plants. The attractiveness of
   ornamental plants to pollinators, however, cannot be presumed, and some
   studies suggest that a majority of ornamental plant varieties receive
   little or no pollinator visitation. Here, we harness the sampling power
   of the western honey bee, a generalist pollinator whose diet breadth
   overlaps substantially with that of other pollinators, to survey the
   utilization of ornamental plants grown at three commercial nurseries in
   Connecticut, USA. Using a combination of DNA metabarcoding and
   microscopy, we identify, to genus-level, pollen samples from honey bee
   colonies placed within each nursery, and we compare our results with
   nursery plant inventories to identify the subset of cultivated genera
   that were visited during pollen foraging. Samples were collected weekly
   from May to September, encompassing the majority of the growing season.
   Our findings show that some plant genera known to be cultivated as
   ornamentals in our system, particularly ornamental trees and shrubs
   (e.g. Hydrangea, Rosa, Spiraea, Syringa, Viburnum), functioned as major
   pollen sources, but the majority of plants inventoried at our nurseries
   provided little or no pollen to honey bees. These results are in
   agreement with a growing body of literature highlighting the special
   importance of woody plants as resources for flower-visiting insects. We
   encourage further exploration of the genera highlighted in our data as
   potential components of pollinator-friendly ornamental greenspace.}},

Title = {{FPA Pareto optimality-based multiobjective approach for capacitor
   placement and reconductoring of urban distribution systems with solar DG
   units}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMBIENT ENERGY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA)-based Pareto optimal
   approach is proposed for optimal network reconductoring of urban
   distribution systems integrated with solar Distributed Generations (DGs)
   along with shunt capacitor placement. Predefined fixed Solar DG
   installation is considered at every node for peak load operation.
   Multiple Pareto objective functions are formed considering the
   objectives of minimising conductor investment cost, annual energy loss
   cost at different load factors and the optimum sizing of shunt
   capacitors at optimum locations. The proposed algorithm is simulated on
   51 bus and 85 bus radial distribution networks. The results obtained
   with the proposed Pareto FPA are compared with the conventional cost
   objective function and PSO Pareto algorithms. The economical savings
   with and without government subsidy on solar DG purchase are analysed.
   The effect of load growth and increase in solar DG penetration levels on
   the performance of distribution systems are demonstrated.}},

   environmental conditions along a rural-urban gradient}},
Journal = {{NEOBIOTA}},

Number = {{54}},
Pages = {{23-47}},

Abstract = {{Compared to rural environments, cities are known to be extraordinarily
   rich in plant species. In particular, the proportion of alien plant
   species is higher in urban areas. This is attributed to specific urban
   conditions, which provide a large variety of habitats due to high
   geological heterogeneity. It can also be attributed to the role of
   cities as centres for plant introductions and the consequential
   increased propagule pressure. Neophytes, alien plant species introduced
   after the discovery of the Americas, appear to contribute especially
   strongly to the increased proportion of alien plants in cities. To
   investigate whether the plant traits of neophytes can be explained by
   environmental variables, we modelled the composition of their
   pollination types and growth forms as well as their diaspore weight and
   the onset of flowering in response to a selection of climatic,
   geological, land cover and traffic network variables with data from
   Germany. To test for a specific urban effect, we included their
   interactions with the area of urban land use.
   In general, we found that climatic variables were the most important
   predictors for all traits. However, when considering interactions with
   urbanisation, non-climatic variables, which often were not significant
   as the main effect, remained in the final models. This points to an
   existing `urban effect'. However, it is much smaller compared to the
   purely climatic effects. We conclude that interferences and alterations
   mainly related to urbanisation and human activity in general are
   responsible for the different ecological processes found in cities
   compared to rural areas. In addition, we argue that considering
   functional traits is an appropriate way to identify the ecological
   mechanisms related to urbanisation.}},

Abstract = {{Standard Hirst-type automated pollen and spore traps are used in
   aerobiology to assess ambient pollen concentrations with a focus on
   allergenic taxa, which are wind-pollinated. The relationship of insect
   to wind pollinated pollen concentrations has not been examined. We
   analysed the pollen data from the pollen seasons (1 April-31 August)
   2008-2017 of seven pollen traps distributed across Austria located at
   different elevations. The included pollen monitoring stations cover the
   diversity of the countries' landscape: from large cities to alpine
   areas. The data was grouped into taxa known as insect (39 taxa) and taxa
   known as wind pollinated (43 taxa). We found a low occurrence of insect
   pollinated pollen in comparison to wind pollinated pollen in all
   stations. The mean pollen concentration of insect pollinated pollen was
   low and ranged from 0 to 22 pollen/m(3) air. Correlation coefficients
   showed the dependence of the results on the parameters year, station and
   year x station, thus explaining the variability of the data. However,
   differences in abundances of insect and wind pollinated pollen concern
   also the time of the year with later peaks (May-June) of insect
   pollinated pollen in comparison to wind pollinated pollen (April).
   Insect pollinated pollen shows a different timing and quantitative
   aspect in comparison to wind pollinated pollen in air samples of
   Hirst-type pollen traps and thus a presumed dependence on local factors.
   These results should be taken into account when interpreting ancient
   pollen spectra to reconstruct palaeoenvironments and when monitoring
   recent climate change using aerobiological archives.}},

Abstract = {{Premise Citizen science platforms for sharing photographed digital
   vouchers, such as iNaturalist, are a promising source of phenology data,
   but methods and best practices for use have not been developed. Here we
   introduce methods using Yucca flowering phenology as a case study,
   because drivers of Yucca phenology are not well understood despite the
   need to synchronize flowering with obligate pollinators. There is also
   evidence of recent anomalous winter flowering events, but with unknown
   spatiotemporal extents. Methods We collaboratively developed a rigorous,
   consensus-based approach for annotating and sharing whole plant and
   flower presence data from iNaturalist and applied it to Yucca records.
   We compared spatiotemporal flowering coverage from our annotations with
   other broad-scale monitoring networks (e.g., the National Phenology
   Network) in order to determine the unique value of photograph-based
   citizen science resources. Results Annotations from iNaturalist were
   uniquely able to delineate extents of unusual flowering events in Yucca.
   These events, which occurred in two different regions of the Desert
   Southwest, did not appear to disrupt the typical-period flowering.
   Discussion Our work demonstrates that best practice approaches to
   scoring iNaturalist records provide fine-scale delimitation of
   phenological events. This approach can be applied to other plant groups
   to better understand how phenology responds to changing climate.}},

Abstract = {{Grafting has been reported as a factor that influences fruit quality.
   However, a comprehensive study of the metabolic profile related to fruit
   quality and the underlying molecular mechanism in grafted watermelon has
   not been carried out. Metabolomics and transcriptome analysis were
   performed on both pumpkin-grafted watermelon and ungrafted watermelon at
   different developmental stages. In total, 56 primary metabolites were
   identified with either high or low abundance between ungrafted and
   pumpkin-grafted watermelon. The results indicated that ornithine,
   arginine, lysine (amino acids), glucose, sucrose, glucosamine (sugars),
   malic acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid (organic acids) were among
   the dominant metabolites influencing fruit quality. Additionally,
   comparative RNA sequence analysis on grafted and ungrafted watermelon
   yielded 729, 174, 128 and 356 differentially expressed genes at 10, 18,
   26 and 34 days after pollination (DAP), respectively. Functional
   annotations of these genes indicated that grafting significantly altered
   the biological and metabolic processes related to fruit quality. Our
   comparative metabolomics and transcriptome analysis revealed that FBA2,
   FK, SuSy, SPS, IAI, AI and sugar transporter gene (SWT3b) might play a
   central role in the accumulation of glucose and sucrose, whereas higher
   malic acid content was attributed to high down regulation of ALMT13 and
   ALMT8 in pumpkin-grafted watermelon. Changes in the ornithine,
   glutamine, alanine, tyrosine, valine, asparagine, phenylalanine,
   arginine and tryptophan contents were consistent with the transcript
   level of their metabolic genes such as NAOD, GS, AGT, TaT, aDH1, OGDH,
   aDC, 4CL 1, PaL, CaT and two nitrate transporter genes (NRTJ) in
   pumpkin-grafted watermelon. This study provides the basis for
   understanding the graft-responsive changes in the metabolic profile and

Abstract = {{At the colonization site of a foreign entity, plant cells alter their
   trajectory of growth and development. The resulting structure - a plant
   gall - accommodates various needs of the foreigner, which are
   phylogenetically diverse: viruses, bacteria, protozoa, oomycetes, true
   fungi, parasitic plants, and many types of animals, including rotifers,
   nematodes, insects, and mites. The plant species that make galls also
   are diverse. We assume gall production costs the plant. All is well if
   the foreigner provides a gift that makes up for the cost.
   Nitrogen-fixing nodule-inducing bacteria provide nutritional services.
   Gall wasps pollinate fig trees. Unfortunately for plants, most galls are
   made for foes, some of which are deeply studied pathogens and pests:
   Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Rhodococcus fascians, Xanthomonas citri,
   Pseudomonas savastanoi, Pantoea agglomerans, `Candidatus' phytoplasma,
   rust fungi, Ustilago smuts, root knot and cyst nematodes, and gall
   midges. Galls are an understudied phenomenon in plant developmental
   biology. We propose gall inception for discovering unifying features of
   the galls that plants make for friends and foes, talk about molecules
   that plants and gall-inducers use to get what they want from each other,
   raise the question of whether plants colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi respond in a gall-like manner, and present a research agenda.}},

Abstract = {{Kokum (Garcinia indica) tree is endemic to Western Ghats region of
   India. Commercially, Kokum fruits are well-known for anti-obesity factor
   hydroxy citric acid as well as for their UV protecting activity.
   Locally, it is also used for culinary purposes and preparing healthy
   beverages. Still, due to endemicity and unreliable fruit production,
   this plant is largely underutilized. In the current study, a controlled
   pollination experiment was performed on three sets of female flowers to
   determine the need of pollination for fruit set. The set of flowers
   bagged without pollination did not show any fruit set, suggesting the
   need of pollen stimulus for the fruit setting. In artificially and
   naturally pollinated flowers, a well-developed female gametophyte was
   seen after 12 days from anthesis, but zygotic embryo or endosperm was
   not detected suggesting apomictic fruit set. The possibility of apomixis
   was also studied at the molecular level for a known male and two female
   plants and their F1 progenies with the help of ISSR markers. The
   majority of F1 progenies showed a banding pattern identical to the
   female parent indicating apomixis, while a few progenies showed
   different banding patterns, suggesting sexual reproduction. Therefore,
   it appears that the G. indica reproduces via facultative apomixis.}},

Abstract = {{Across urban environments, vegetated habitats provide refuge for
   biodiversity. Gardens (designed for food crop production) and nurseries
   (designed for ornamental plant production) are both urban agricultural
   habitats characterized by high plant species richness but may vary in
   their ability to support wild pollinators, particularly bees. In
   gardens, pollinators are valued for crop production. In nurseries,
   ornamental plants rarely require pollination; thus, the potential of
   nurseries to support pollinators has not been examined. We asked how
   these habitats vary in their ability to support wild bees, and what
   habitat features relate to this variability. In 19 gardens and 11
   nurseries in California, USA, we compared how local habitat and
   landscape features affected wild bee species abundance and richness. To
   assess local features, we estimated floral richness and measured ground
   cover as proxies for food and nesting resources, respectively. To assess
   landscape features, we measured impervious land cover surrounding each
   site. Our analyses showed that differences in floral richness, local
   habitat size, and the amount of urban land cover impacted garden wild
   bee species richness. In nurseries, floral richness and the proportion
   of native plant species impacted wild bee abundance and richness. We
   suggest management guidelines for supporting wild pollinators in both
   habitats.}},

Title = {{Land Conversion for Solar Facilities and Urban Sprawl in Southwest
   Deserts Causes Different Amounts of Habitat Loss for Ashmeadiella Bees}},

Abstract = {{Land conversion for human use poses one of the greatest threats to
   terrestrial ecosystems and causes habitat loss for a myriad of species.
   The development of large solar energy facilities and urban sprawl are
   converting wild lands in the Southwest deserts of the USA for human use
   and resulting in habitat loss for desert species. This is in part due to
   the Southwest deserts being identified as having high renewable energy
   potential while urban areas expand into areas supporting high
   biodiversity. Previous studies have quantified development within some
   of these biodiversity hotspots, but none have investigated direct
   species-specific habitat loss for different species of pollinators.
   Native bees are poorly studied, and therefore it is difficult to know
   how much habitat has been lost. We quantified the amount of land
   conversion occurring between 2010 and 2015 in Clark County, NV, Mojave
   County, AZ, and San Bernardino County, CA to assess direct loss of
   potential-habitat for species in the Southwest deserts. Using Satellite
   images, we quantified the direct habitat loss to solar facilities and
   estimated other land conversion due to urban sprawl using USDA land
   cover data. We created eco-niche models in MaxENT for ten Ashmeadiella
   bees, to estimate the amount of direct, potential-habitat loss caused by
   solar development and urban expansion. Our data suggest species are not
   equally affected by land conversion in the Southwest deserts and direct,
   potential-habitat loss to urban sprawl is much greater than the loss due
   to solar facilities. Furthermore, our data show each species incurs
   different amounts of habitat loss to both solar development and urban
   expansion as well as between counties. These results should assist in
   pollinator conservation program development by illustrating land
   conversion can vary between local governments and pollinator species.}},

Title = {{Tissue-specific organic acid metabolism in reproductive and

Abstract = {{Organic acids are important components of overall fruit quality through
   flavor, taste, nutritional and medicinal values. Pollinated fig (Ficus
   carica L.) fruit quality is enhanced by increased acidity. We quantified
   the major organic acids and characterized the expression pattern of
   organic acid metabolic pathway-related genes in the reproductive part -
   inflorescence and non-reproductive part - receptacle of parthenocarpic
   and pollinated fig fruit during ripening. Essentially, pollinated fruit
   contains seeds in the inflorescence, as opposed to no seeds in the
   parthenocarpic inflorescence. The major organic acids - citrate and
   malate - were found in relatively high quantities in the inflorescence
   compared to the receptacle of both parthenocarpic and pollinated fig
   fruit. Notably, pollination increased citric acid content significantly
   in both inflorescence and receptacle. Genes related to the
   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle,
   citrate catabolism and glyoxylate cycle were identified in fig fruit.
   Expression levels of most of these genes were higher in inflorescences
   than in receptacles. In particular, FcPEPC and FcFUM (encoding fumarase)
   had significantly higher expression in the inflorescence of pollinated
   fruit. Most importantly, expression of the glyoxylate cycle genes FcMLS
   and FcICL (encoding malate synthase and isocitrate lyase, respectively)
   was induced to strikingly high levels in the inflorescence by
   pollination, and their expression level was highly positively correlated
   with the contents of all organic acids. Therefore, the glyoxylate cycle
   may be responsible for altering the accumulation of organic acids to
   upgrade the fruit taste during ripening, especially in the pollinated,
   seeded inflorescence.}},

Title = {{Induced phenological avoidance: A neglected defense mechanism against
   seed predation in plants}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Flowering phenology is an important life-history trait affecting plant
   reproductive performance and is influenced by various abiotic and biotic
   factors. Pre-dispersal seed predation and pollination are expected to
   impose counteracting selection pressure on flowering phenology, with
   pre-dispersal seed predation expected to favour off-peak flowering and
   pollination to favour synchronous flowering. Here we studied the effect
   of pre-dispersal seed predation by the beetle Byturus ochraceus, a
   specialist seed herbivore, on the flowering phenology of Geum urbanum.
   This forest understorey plant species is self-pollinating, so that the
   influence of seed predation can be studied independent from pollination.
   We measured in detail the timing and predation rate of individual
   flowers during two consecutive years in more than 60 individuals. We
   tested the hypotheses that pre-dispersal seed predation exerts selection
   for within-season compensatory flowering as well as for induced
   phenological avoidance in the following season. We found no indication
   for compensatory flowering within a growing season, but plants that
   experienced predation shifted their flowers to the end of the flowering
   season the subsequent year. This induced phenological avoidance points
   to a plastic response to pre-dispersal seed predation that may be
   adaptive. Importantly, the delay in flower production came at a cost,
   since flowers later in the season had a reduced seed output, presumably
   because of increasing light limitation following forest canopy closure.
   Synthesis. Herbivory by specialist enemies can cause serious fitness
   decline in hosts. We here show that induced shifts in phenology can form
   an important defense strategy against pre-dispersal seed predation. The
   induced mismatches between herbivore and host phenology are anticipated
   to be adaptive when herbivory is predictable across successive flowering
   periods.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the natural
   floral volatiles in tree peony and the fragrance components have been
   widely used in the fields of health care, perfumes, and cosmetics.
   However, there is little research on the identification of fragrance
   components of wild tree peony species. In present study, volatile
   components in petals of nine wild tree peony species were analyzed using
   a headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique coupled with
   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 124 volatile
   components were identified and clustered into five major chemical
   classes: terpenoids, alkanes, alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones. Overall,
   combined with the sensory evaluation of nine wild tree peony species,
   Paeonia. ostii (P2) performed herbal and waxy attributes, mainly
   dominated by hexanal and pentadecane, respectively. P rockii (P1), P
   qiui (P3), P jishanensis (P4), and P decomposita (P5) all possessed
   sweet attribute, which was positively correlated with geraniol and
   citronellol. P delavayi (P9), P lutea (P7), P ludlowii (P8), and P
   potanini (P6) performed intense floral attribute dominated by linalool
   and trans-linalool oxide. Moreover, the results of principal component
   analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) showed P
   decomposita (P5), P qiui (P3), P rockii (P1), P jishanensis (P4), and P
   ostii (P2) in the Subsect. Vagiatae were mixed to form one cluster while
   P lutea (P7), P delavayi (P9), P ludlowii (P8), and P potanini (P6) in
   the Subsect. Delavayanae formed the other cluster. In terms of
   geographical distribution, the two clusters are consistent with the
   distribution of wild tree peony species. The present study clarified the
   relationship between fragrance and components and further revealed the
   phylogenetic relationship of nine wild tree peony species, thus
   providing a theoretical basis for their development and utilization.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{A growing body of research indicates that cities can support diverse bee
   communities. However, urbanization may disproportionately benefit exotic
   bees, potentially to the detriment of native species. We examined the
   influence of urbanization on exotic and native bees using two datasets
   from Michigan, USA. We found that urbanization positively influenced
   exotic-but not native-bee abundance and richness, and that this
   association could not be explained by proximity to international ports
   of entry, prevalence of exotic flora or urban warming. We found a
   negative relationship between native and exotic bee abundance at sites
   with high total bee abundance, suggesting that exotic bees may
   negatively affect native bee populations. These effects were not driven
   by the numerically dominant exotic honeybee, but rather by other exotic
   bees. Our findings complicate the emerging paradigm of cities as key
   sites for pollinator conservation.}},

Title = {{Risk to pollinators from anthropogenic electro-magnetic radiation (EMR):
   Evidence and knowledge gaps}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{695}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Worldwide urbanisation and use of mobile and wireless technologies (5G,
   Internet of Things) is leading to the proliferation of anthropogenic
   electromagnetic radiation (EMR) and campaigning voices continue to call
   for the risk to human health and wildlife to be recognised. Pollinators
   provide many benefits to nature and humankind, but face multiple
   anthropogenic threats. Here, we assess whether artificial light at night
   (ALAN) and anthropogenic radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation
   (AREMR), such as used in wireless technologies (4G, 5G) or emitted from
   power lines, represent an additional and growing threat to pollinators.
   A lack of high quality scientific studies means that knowledge of the
   risk to pollinators from anthropogenic EMR is either inconclusive,
   unresolved, or only partly established. A handful of studies provide
   evidence that ALAN can alter pollinator communities, pollination and
   fruit set. Laboratoiy experiments provide sonic, albeit variable,
   evidence that the honey bee Apis meth:fern and other invertebrates can
   detect EMR, potentially using it for orientation or navigation, but they
   do not provide evidence that AREMR affects insect behaviour in
   ecosystems. Scientifically robust evidence of AREMR impacts on abundance
   or diversity of pollinators (or other invertebrates) are limited to a
   single study reporting positive and negative effects depending on the
   pollinator group and geographical location. Therefore, whether
   anthropogenic EMR (ALAN or AREMR) poses a significant threat to insect
   pollinators and the benefits they provide to ecosystems and humanity
   remains to be established. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{URBAN ECOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{271-288}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Urban areas consist of wide expanses of impervious surfaces which are
   known to negatively affect insect biodiversity in general, but green
   spaces within cities have the potential to provide necessary habitat and
   foraging resources. Although, communal gardens were primarily intended
   to provide fresh, regional food to denizens, these green islands also
   host a surprisingly high number of wild bee species. The gardens were
   characterized based on structural elements such as flower frequency, the
   relative percentage of lawn, trees, shrubs, planted crops and
   infrastructure (e.g. seating possibilities or garden houses). Further,
   the effects of different landscape structures surrounding the gardens
   and distance to the city center were analyzed on the total wild bee
   species richness and functional traits. Focusing on these putative
   influencing factors, statistical analyses calculating random decision
   forests along with generalized linear mixed models were applied. With
   113 observed wild bee species, communal gardens provide habitat for a
   quarter of all known species in Vienna. In conclusion, results revealed
   that only elements within the gardens had an effect on species richness,
   with flower frequency as the major positive driver. The examined
   communal gardens promote and conserve wild bees independent from the
   location within the city or garden size. Furthermore, these green
   patches are important sanctuaries, hosting rare and threatened species
   as well as remarkably special wild bee communities.}},

Title = {{Pollen availability for the Horned mason bee (Osmia cornuta) in regions
   of different land use and landscape structures}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{1. Osmia cornuta is a generalist regarding its habitat requirements and
   is used for pollination in orchards. The species collects pollen from
   different plant taxa, but pollen richness and pollen quantity in a nest
   may be affected by land use and landscape structures. 2. The
   availability of pollen resources for O. cornuta was studied across
   different land use types (one urban, village-structured, agricultural,
   and viticultural region each) by pollen analysis in the context of
   landscape structures. 3. In total, 16 pollen types were identified in
   1180 brood cells of O. cornuta. On average (+/- SD), the highest pollen
   richness per region (n = 4) was found in the viticultural region (4.75
   +/- 0.96) and the lowest in the agricultural region (1 +/- 2). Osmia
   cornuta collected predominantly pollen from the Sorbus-pollen group,
   which includes Prunus species. Salix was primarily collected in the
   village-structured and agricultural regions, and Quercus was frequently
   found in samples from the viticulture region. The highest mean (+/- SD)
   number of brood cells per region (n = 4) was found in the viticulture
   region (136.35 +/- 57.45) and the lowest in the agricultural region
   (20.25 +/- 40.5). Increasing proportions of green areas in urban and
   village-structured regions affected the pollen richness positively,
   whereas agricultural areas had a negative impact on pollen richness and
   the number of brood cells. 4. It was concluded that the polylectic O.
   cornuta uses a wide range of flowering plants dependent on their
   availability. The maintenance of fruit trees as well as willow and oak
   trees enhances floral resources qualitatively and quantitatively for
   O.cornuta specifically in intensively farmed agricultural areas.}},

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoids are used to protect citrus trees against pests.
   Dissipation and persistence of neonicotinoids in pollen and nectar of
   citrus trees after foliar applications and their potential exposure to
   pollinators have not been well characterized. Field studies were
   conducted using three orange and one mandarin varieties to compare the
   imidacloprid and thiamethoxam residue levels and their decline in pollen
   and nectar after treatments in pre-bloom close to flowering period and
   their persistence 1 yr after treatment. The possible risk to honeybees
   was assessed. In nectar, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid residues were
   between 61 and 99\% lower than in pollen, depending on the citrus
   variety or/and the days after treatment when applied close to blooming.
   At the end of the flowering period, imidacloprid in pollen and nectar
   was not detected in the mandarin variety after treatment in pre-bloom,
   whereas for thiamethoxam, no residues were detected in nectar but 10
   ng/g was detected in pollen. There were no quantifiable levels of
   residues for either neonicotinoids in pollen or nectar during the
   flowering period of the following year. Neonicotinoid residue levels and
   their decline in nectar and pollen in citrus depended on the timing of
   applications relative to flowering and on the citrus variety. The
   absence of neonicotinoid residues 1 yr out after foliar applications in
   all varieties assayed demonstrated that none of the neonicotinoids
   tested were persistent. The results could be different in other citrus
   varieties, and therefore, also the exposure assessment for managed
   pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Pollin'air is a citizen network of observers of plants bearing
   allergenic pollens. The aim is to enable people with allergies to
   receive real-time and location-based notifications in the event of
   release of allergenic pollens. It was initiated in July 2016 thanks to
   the partnership between Air Lorraine (which became Atmo Grand Est in
   2017), the Regional Observatory of Health and Social Affairs in Lorraine
   (which became ORS Grand Est in 2018), the laboratory of medical
   hydrology and climatology at the Nancy Faculty of Medicine, the
   Jean-Marie Pelt Botanical Garden (Villers-les-Nancy), the Lorraine
   Regional Health Agency (now ARS Grand Est), the Regional Union of
   Pharmacists of Lorraine Health Professionals (now URPS Pharmacists Grand
   Est), and the Metropolitan Area of Greater Nancy. Pollin'air is a
   participatory citizen network that connects volunteer sentinels, who
   observe the pollination of allergenic plant species, with allergic
   subjects via a digital platform. Using the information provided by the
   former, these subjects can rapidly adjust their behavior, thus reducing
   the health effects associated with pollination periods. Further, health
   professionals can adjust their diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
   The phenological observation of 25 allergenic species (flowering,
   pollination, end of pollination) is carried out by pollen sentinels in
   Lorraine, France. Real-time and geolocated information is collated on an
   interactive map on the www.pollinair.fr website. Allergic subjects can
   receive personalized alerts based on their allergy and their
   geographical location. Through Pollin'air it is possible to acquire
   extensive phenological data. It provides qualitative and geolocated
   information specific to different plant species. Important geographical
   variations in pollination are highlighted within the territory, over a
   period of up to 1 month for artemisia. Analysis of pollen information
   recorded by the 3 monitoring tools used in Nancy, France, shows that the
   phenological watch performed at the botanical garden provided the
   earliest information 6 times out of 14, compared with 5 times out of 14
   for the Pollin'air network and 3 times out of 14 for the National
   Network of Aerobiological Surveillance (RNSA). The satisfaction surveys
   conducted with sentinels and allergic subjects attest to the fact that
   participants have acquired knowledge in terms of both botany and
   allergies, and that 9 out of 10 allergic subjects endorse the proposal
   to adapt their behavior and their treatment to new pollen developments.
   This participatory network has created collective and intergenerational
   dynamics around the public health issue of pollen allergy, bringing
   together health professionals, botanists, air experts, local authorities
   and citizens. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cypress trees belong to the Cupressaceae family, which includes 140
   species with indeciduous foliage. The most important genera in terms of
   allergic diseases are Cupressus sempervirens or green cypress, Cupressus
   arizonica or blue cypress (now named Hesperocyparis arizonica),
   Juniperus oxycedrus, Juniperus communis and thuya. Since J. oxycedrus
   pollinates in October, C. sempervirens in January and February, C.
   arizonica in February and March, and J. communis in April, the
   symptomatic period is very long. Due to global warming, the pollination
   period is becoming longer and Cupressaceae species are currently
   migrating northwards. In the Mediterranean countries, cypress is by far
   the most important pollinating species, accounting for half of all
   pollination. The major allergens belong to group 1. The other allergens
   from cypress and juniper share 75 to 97 \% structural homology with the
   group 1 major allergens. The prevalence of cypress allergy in the
   general population ranges from 5 \% to 13 \%, depending on exposure to
   pollen. According to different studies, 9 to 35 \% of outpatients
   consulting an allergist show sensitization to cypress pollen. Repeated
   cross-sectional studies performed at intervals of between 10 and 15
   years demonstrate a threefold increase in the percentage level of
   cypress allergy. Risk factors include genetic predisposition and/or high
   exposure to pollen, with air pollutants potentially playing a
   synergistic role. Study of the natural history of cypress allergy shows
   a subgroup of patients with no personal or family history of atopy and
   whose disease began later in life, with low total IgE and often
   monosensitization to cypress pollen. In these patients, the disease is
   allergic rather than atopic. Clinically, rhinitis is the most prevalent
   symptom while conjunctivitis is the most disabling. Cross-reactivity
   exists with citrus fruit and peach allergies. The pharmacological
   treatment of cypress allergy is the same as for other allergies.
   Hypo-sensitization has been used for a long time, formerly via
   injections but nowadays mostly sublingually, although clinical trials
   have included only a small number of patients. Avoidance can be achieved
   by individual subjects avoiding contact, but also at the community level
   through the use of different plants, selection of low-pollinating
   cypresses and by trimming hedges prior to pollination. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Public concern for the conservation of pollinating insect communities,
   such as bees, has created demand for more florally diverse landscapes.
   In urban environments, lawns form a large portion of cultivated land,
   and are typically managed to exclude flowering species richness. In this
   study, we investigated the establishment of eight flowering plants with
   pollinator value (plants that provide floral nectar and pollen for
   visiting insects) when coseeded with the turfgrass hard fescue ( Festuca
   brevipila Tracey). The study was established as a dormant seeding at two
   locations in central Minnesota with substantially different soil types.
   Plots were maintained at either a 6- or 9-cm mowing height. We monitored
   these plantings over the 2014, 2015, and 2016 growing seasons for
   vegetative establishment and flowering of planted forbs. Of the eight
   forbs tested, Trifolium repens L., Prunella vulgaris ssp. lanceolata (W.
   Bartram) Hulten, Thymus serpyllum auct. non L., and Astragalus
   crassicarpus Nutt. established in at least one location. Mowing height
   did not affect vegetative establishment, but had a negative effect on
   the number of blooms produced by P. vulgaris ssp. lanceolata .
   Vegetative establishment was affected by location, with P. vulgaris ssp.
   lanceolata establishing in higher abundance in the moist loamy site,
   whereas T. serpyllum and A. crassicarpus established in higher abundance
   at the dry sandy site. This study represents an important first step in
   identifying appropriate plants and management practices for improving
   lawns as a resource for pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Plant male sterility refers to the failure in the production of fertile
   pollen. It occurs spontaneously in natural populations and may be caused
   by genes encoded in the nuclear (genic male sterility; GMS) or
   mitochondria! (cytoplasmic male sterility; CMS) genomes. This feature
   has great agronomic value for the production of hybrid seeds, since it
   prevents self pollination without the need of emasculation which is
   time-consuming and cost-intensive. CMS has been widely used in crops,
   such as corn, rice, wheat, citrus, and several species of the family
   Solanaceae. Mitochondrial genes determining CMS have been uncovered in a
   wide range of plant species. The modes of action of CMS have been
   classified in terms of the effect they produce in the cell, which
   ultimately leads to a failure in the production of fertile pollen. Male
   fertility can be restored by nuclear-encoded genes, termed
   restorer-offertility (Rf) factors. CMS from wild plants has been
   transferred to species of agronomic interest through somatic
   hybridization. Somatic hybrids have also been produced to generate CMS
   de novo upon recombination of the mitochondrial genomes of two parental
   plants or by separating the CMS cytoplasm from the nuclear Rf alleles.
   As a result, somatic hybridization can he used as a highly efficient and
   useful strategy to incorporate CMS in breeding programs.}},

Abstract = {{Urban green areas can provide ecosystem services such as biodiversity
   conservation, recreational and educational services, and local climate
   regulation including stormwater management. Implementation of
   sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) allows for development of
   designs targeting desired habitats or species groups. This study
   investigated short-term changes in a plant community following
   implementation of a SUDS designed to enhance nature quality of a 4.8 ha
   urban grassland in Lynge, Denmark. Dry basins allowed for water
   detention with construction entailing terrain modifications, seeding of
   target species and changes to water dynamics, resulting in four
   treatments differing in soil conditions and water regimes. Plant species
   richness and composition were documented before (2012) and two years
   after (2015 and 2016) implementation of the SUDS. A floral resources
   index was composed to assess the quality of the flora as foraging
   resource for four groups of bees. Plant species richness, alpha- and
   beta-diversity as well as frequency of target plant species
   significantly increased after SUDS construction, as did floral resources
   for bees. Increased alpha diversity was primarily seen in areas around
   dry basins, while the increase in overall beta-diversity related to a
   shift in plant community composition within dry basins. The SUDS
   construction also changed dominance relationships among plant groups as
   forb cover increased at the expense of grasses, and cover of seeded and
   post-construction naturally colonising species increased. Two years
   after construction this study confirms potentials of SUDS to enhance
   ecological value of urban grasslands, when targets for ecological
   enhancement are integrated in the SUDS design.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of tourists visit Croatia during the summer months, which
   overlaps with the ragweed pollination season, and this might be the main
   health issue, which could affect Croatian tourism. Therefore, the aim of
   this research was to perform the preliminary analyses of ragweed pollen
   seasons in two different Croatian tourist cities-continental Zagreb and
   Mediterranean Zadar, and to define researched areas according to the
   allergenic risk assessment. The research was performed during a 10-year
   period (2008-2017), and aerobiological samplings, as well as qualitative
   and quantitative analyses, were carried out by standard methodology
   recommended by EAN/REA. The results showed differences between cities in
   the seasonal pollen integral (SPIn) and intradiurnal variations index
   (IDI) of ragweed pollen, and similarities in the features of the main
   pollen seasons (MPS). The SPIn was higher in the air of Zagreb during
   the whole studied period; it was on average 2899 pg/m(3) in Zagreb and
   579 pg/m(3) in Zadar. The MPS in both cities were similar (from the
   first half of August until the mid-September) and relatively short,
   around 40 days. The IDI indicates that Ambrosia pollen in Zagreb derives
   from local sources, whilst in Zadar is probably a result of long-range
   transport. According to the allergenic risk assessment, Zagreb is placed
   in the intermediate-risk area and Zadar in the low-risk area. Relatively
   short exposure times during the summer periods enable both cities to be
   favourable tourist destinations even during the ragweed seasons,
   especially Zadar, with its low ragweed pollen concentrations.}},

   To identify the ancestors of Pompia, 70 citrus species of the Citrus
   genus were genotyped with 36 codominant molecular markers (SSR and
   InDel) of nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes. Diversity analysis and
   allelic comparisons between each citrus species at each locus indicated
   that Pompia resembles lemon and limonette of Marrakech, i.e. the result
   of a cross between sour orange (C. aurantium L.) and citron, where
   citron was the pollinator. Two Italian citron varieties were identified
   as potential male parents, i.e. Diamante and Common Poncire. However, we
   were unable to differentiate varieties of sour oranges because varietal
   diversification in this horticultural group resulted from DNA sequence
   variations that SSR or InDel markers could not reveal. Rhob el Arsa and
   Poncire de Collioure were found to be two synonyms of Pompia. Pompia
   appeared to be equally distinct from citron, lemon and sour orange based
   on the overall analysis of the fruit, leaf and seed phenotype, and juice
   chemical composition. At the leaf level, the Pompia essential oil (EO)
   composition is close to that of citron whereas the zest is much closer
   to that of sour orange.}},

Abstract = {{As garden plants in urbanized environments provide considerable diverse
   floral resources to pollinators, the availability of floral resources
   has changed as a consequence of increasing urbanization. Although
   pollinators often forage at different sites in response to
   spatiotemporal variations in floral resources, little is known about the
   differences in pollinator foraging between urban and nearby natural
   environments. We monitored the foraging patterns of bumblebees in open
   and forest habitats in two areas with and without urban gardens with
   respect to flowering phenology and the availability of floral resources
   in each habitat. Floral richness in the forest habitat decreased as the
   season progressed, with a peak in late spring to early summer, whereas
   floral resources in the open habitat increased late in the season. Thus,
   floral resources in the open habitat could compensate for seasonal
   declines in forest floral resources. In the urban area, which contained
   green gardens, floral richness in the open habitat was much greater than
   that in the forest habitat. This resulted in a relatively high density
   of bumblebees in the open habitat in the urban area compared with those
   in the natural area, which lacked green gardens. Visitation frequency of
   bumblebees to forest flowers decreased as the floral richness of the
   open habitat increased. These results suggest that although urban
   gardens are important foraging sites for pollinators, the high
   attractiveness of garden flowers reduces pollinator visits to
   wildflowers in nearby forests. This may result in reduced pollination of
   native flowers.}},

Abstract = {{In urban areas, the diversity and abundance of cavity-nesting
   Hymenoptera may be restricted due to scarce nesting resources.
   Artificial nesting sites (nesting aids) are being installed to
   compensate for this shortage in a growing number of private gardens and
   public greenspaces to support Hymenoptera (especially bee) diversity.
   Various nesting aids are commercially available, but their effectiveness
   has so far not been investigated empirically. We compared a low-budget
   commercial nesting aid with a customized version based on scientific
   evidence. Commercial models comprised bamboo and coniferous wood
   cavities with fixed short lengths and little variation in diameter,
   whereas customized models comprised hardwood, reed and bamboo cavities
   with varying lengths and diameters. Both models were exposed pairwise in
   private gardens over one season and nesting Hymenoptera species
   identified. The commercial nesting aids were less well occupied, hosted
   fewer brood cells and had lower species diversity. Hardwood showed the
   highest rate of occupancy but reed cavities hosted the highest species
   diversity due to diverse cavity diameter and length combinations.
   Cavities with diameters between four and eight mm were occupied most
   often. Regardless of material, cavities with smooth entrances were
   strongly preferred. Nesting aids designed in accordance with our
   findings may thus support high and diverse populations of cavity-nesting
   Hymenoptera in anthropogenically transformed habitats such as urban
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{There is great interest in planting urban areas to benefit pollinating
   insects, with the potential that urban areas and gardens could act as an
   extensive network of pollinator-friendly habitats. However, there are a
   great many different plant cultivars available to the gardener, and a
   paucity of evidence-based advice as to which plants are truly most
   attractive to flower-visiting insects. Here, we report insect visitation
   to metre square plots of 111 different ornamental plant cultivars at a
   site in central UK. Data were collected over 5 years, and comprise over
   9000 insect observations, which were identified to species (for
   honeybees and bumblebees) or as `solitary bees', Syrphidae, Lepidoptera
   and `others'. Unlike some previous studies, we found no difference in
   numbers of insects attracted to native or non-native species, or
   according to whether plants were annuals, biennials or perennials, but
   we did find that native plants attracted a significantly higher
   diversity of flower-visiting insects. Overall, the most-visited plants
   were Calamintha nepeta, Helenium autumnale and Geranium rozanne.
   However, patterns of visitation were quite different for every insect
   taxa examined. For example, different species of short-tongued
   bumblebees showed little overlap in their most-preferred plant
   cultivars. Interestingly, very similar plant cultivars often attracted
   different insect communities; for example, 72\% of visitors to Aster
   novi belgii were honeybees or bumblebees, while the related Anthemis
   tinctoria, which also has daisy-like flowers, did not attract a single
   honeybee or bumblebee but was popular with solitary bees, hoverflies,
   and `other' pollinators. Some plant cultivars such as Eryngium planum
   and Myosotis arvensis were attractive to a broad range of insects, while
   others attracted only a few species but sometimes in large numbers, such
   as Veronicastrum virginicum and Helenium autumnale which were both
   visited predominantly by honey bees. It is clear that we do not yet
   fully understand what factors drive insect flower preferences.
   Recommendations are made as to which flower cultivars could be combined
   to provide forage for a diversity of pollinator groups over the season
   from early spring to autumn, though it must be born in mind that some
   plants are likely to perform differently when grown in different
   environmental conditions.}},

Title = {{Forest proximity and lowland mosaic increase robustness of tropical
   pollination networks in mixed fruit orchards}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{192}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{More than 30\% of global crop plants rely on pollinators to set fruit or
   seed. While several studies have documented the negative effects of
   habitat degradation and distance from natural habitats on pollinator
   diversity in tropical areas, such studies have focused on single crops
   in particular areas without examining entire plant-pollinator
   communities. Here, we compared the plant-pollinator network structure
   between mixed fruit orchards that were near to (< 1 km) and far from (>
   7 km) tropical forests and further investigated the effect of landscape
   composition in surrounding areas on plant-pollinator network structure.
   Our ten pairs of orchards were in Thailand and grew a range of tropical
   fruits pollinated by Insects, birds and bats. The average number of
   visitor-flower interactions was higher at sites near the forest.
   Similarly, network robustness (the resistance of the network to losing
   species as a result of primary species removal) and interaction evenness
   (evenness of interactions among species) were higher at the sites closer
   to the forest. Robustness was strongly positively influenced by the
   proportion of lowland mosaic within a 1 km radius, while interaction
   evenness was positively affected by the proportion of urban area and
   montane mosaic within a 4 km radius of each site. Conservation of
   (semi-) natural habitats is therefore important for maintaining the
   diversity of wild pollinators and agricultural production.}},

Title = {{Comparative survival and fitness of bumble bee colonies in natural,
   suburban, and agricultural landscapes}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{284}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Pollinators such as bumble bees are in decline as a result of many
   factors, including loss of habitat. Initiatives to improve and restore
   pollinator habitat are increasingly popular. However, to most
   effectively conserve pollinators, we need a better understanding of
   which habitats limit their survival and fitness at the landscape scale.
   Our study examined performance and fitness of the common eastern bumble
   bee, Bombus impatiens (Cresson), in four common landscapes for bees
   (natural, suburban, conventional agriculture, and organic agriculture).
   In the summers of 2016 and 2017, 64 bumble bee colonies per year were
   deployed across 16 sites (4 sites in each landscape type in each year)
   and their growth (weight and bee abundance), fitness (caste production),
   and survival were monitored weekly. Colonies in suburban sites in 2016,
   but not 2017, were lighter, produced fewer worker and drone cells, and
   experienced queen death more quickly than colonies in natural and
   agricultural landscapes. The performance and fitness of colonies in
   natural, organic agricultural, and conventional agricultural landscapes
   in both years were similar. Additionally, across all landscape types,
   the proportion of developed land and impervious surface were
   significantly negatively associated with colony performance in 2016.
   Thus, our results suggested that suburban landscapes are suboptimal for
   B. impatiens compared to natural and agricultural landscapes, and that
   this effect differs across years, potentially due to climactic
   differences. Future research is needed to identify the mechanisms
   responsible for reduced performance of bumble bee colonies in suburban
   landscapes, especially regarding floral resources and pesticide and
   pathogen stress. Such information could direct specific actions to
   improve suburban habitat for pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination specialists are increasingly threatened worldwide,
   especially in intensively-managed durian orchards where loss of
   pollinators may lead to reduced fruit production. In tropical plant
   communities where plant species attract multiple species of pollinators,
   specialists may have advantages over generalists. The present study
   examined the pollination ecology of durian (Durio zibethinus) in
   intensively and non-intensively managed orchards in suburban habitats of
   Nakhon Nayok and Chanthaburi provinces, respectively, in Thailand.
   Manual-pollination yielded the greatest fruit set 60 d after
   pollination, followed by open pollination (mostly by pteropodid bats),
   and insect pollination, while non-pollinated flowers had no fruit set.
   Eonycteris spelaea was the major bat pollinator in both provinces. Bats
   found in suburban habitat of Nakhon Nayok were mostly Eonycteris spelaea
   (67\%). Pollen of at least five plant species was found on Eonycteris
   spelaea fur, including Musa sp., Oroxylum indicum, Durio zibethinus,
   Bombax valetonii and an unknown species. Pollen of only two species,
   Oroxylum indicum and Musa sp., was observed on Cynopterus sphinx fur.
   The non-intensive orchards in Nakhon Nayok, where mixed-species gardens
   are maintained under more naturalistic conditions, might offer higher
   fruit set on average. Such conditions might maintain higher bats capture
   rate of natural pollinators and reduce the risk of pollination failure
   in comparison with intensively-managed durian orchards.}},

Abstract = {{Wild bees provide pollination services and are currently declining at
   the global scale. A potential cause for this decline is competitive
   interactions with domestic honey bees. Urban beekeeping, a fairly new
   activity, is rapidly gaining popularity. In contrast with agricultural
   and natural areas, the extent of competition between honey bees and wild
   bees in urban areas is unclear. The objectives of this study were to
   quantify the impact of honey bees, urbanization, and the availability of
   floral resources on wild bee communities. We hypothesized that honey
   bees exert negative impacts on wild bees, that floral resources favor
   wild bee communities and mitigate the negative impacts of competition
   with honey bees, and that the influence of heat islands, used as a proxy
   for urbanization, varies between wild bees with their functional traits
   (nesting behavior). We tested these hypotheses with a data set of 19,077
   wild bee specimens collected using colored pan-traps at 25 urban sites
   in 2012 and 2013. We investigated community and population patterns
   after accounting for imperfect detection probability. We found no
   evidence of competition between wild and domesticated bees. Our analyses
   indicate mixed effects of urban heat islands across species and positive
   effects of floral resources. We conclude that cities can allow the
   coexistence of urban beekeeping and wild bees under moderate hive
   densities. However, it will remain crucial to further investigate the
   competitive interactions between wild and honey bees to determine the
   threshold of hive densities beyond which competition could occur.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization has resulted in the loss of natural habitat for many bat
   species, often placing bats in close proximity to humans. Bats are
   generally perceived as agricultural and medical pests, despite providing
   ecosystem services including seed dispersal and pollination.
   Understanding public perceptions and knowledge of bats as well as
   responses to bats is necessary for developing suitable educational
   programs to support bat conservation. Here we examined the urban
   communities? knowledge of bats and how they perceive and respond to bats
   in Peninsular Malaysia. A questionnaire survey of 340 respondents
   revealed that women generally had better knowledge of bats compared with
   men. Respondents with tertiary education and knowledge of the ecological
   roles of bats tended to support the conservation of bats. In addition,
   there was low demand for bat meat in this region. Family-based
   educational programs could help to improve the perception of bats among
   women and increase knowledge of bats among men. Educational programs
   highlighting the biology and ecology of bats should be conducted at
   primary and secondary schools to raise awareness of bats among children

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Relationships between invasive plants and other species in their
   introduced ranges may facilitate or hinder the process of invasion.
   Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed), Fallopia sachalinensis (giant
   knotweed), and their hybrid Fallopia x bohemica (Bohemian knotweed) are
   widespread invasive plants in North America and Europe. These species
   possess extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) that attract mutualist insect
   protectors in their native ranges. Popillia japonica Newman, 1841
   (Japanese beetle) is a primary herbivore of invasive Fallopia spp. in
   these species' native range in Japan. These natural enemies are reunited
   in North America, where Fallopia spp. have been repeatedly introduced as
   ornamental plantings of residential and commercial properties since the
   1800s, and the Japanese beetle has become a widespread insect pest.
   Spread of Fallopia spp. and their hybrids along linear features of urban
   landscapes such as roads, railways, and waterways make their performance
   in urban environments important to these invasive species' impact. To
   test the role of insect interactions in the success of Fallopia japonica
   and F. x bohemica in urban conditions in their invasive range, we
   examined ant visitation, Japanese beetle abundance and herbivory,
   ant-Japanese beetle interactions, pollinator visits, and seed
   production. All active herbivory observed was by Japanese beetles. Leaf
   area loss to herbivory was much lower than levels reported in Japan,
   suggesting partial enemy release. New Fallopia leaves were more
   frequently visited by ants than mature leaves, while Japanese beetle
   herbivory was observed on mature but not on new leaves. All ant species
   observed visiting invasive Fallopia EFN were native to North America.
   Active physical defense by these ants against Japanese beetles was
   observed but was rare. Native and non-native insects visited Fallopia
   flowers, followed by seed production. Our results indicate that both
   native and non-native species may facilitate invasion of Fallopia
   through pollination and protection mutualisms.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{This study, using remote sensing techniques and GIS, studied the land
   use land cover (LULC) changes of Anzali International Wetland from 1975
   to 2013, and the effects of these changes on the ES (ecosystem service)
   values of the wetland. The benefit transfer method was used to estimate
   the economic value of the ecosystem goods and services. The basis for
   the valuations was the values provided for the ES of the world biomes.
   According to the results, in the period of study (1975 to 2013), the
   highest percentage of incremental change was attributed to urban and
   manmade centers (73.85 \%), while the lowest was related to the wetland
   coverage area (0.32 \%). Value changes between 1975 and 1975 for
   agricultural lands were positive and equal to US\$ 12.85 million and for
   the rangelands were negative and equal to US\$ - 26.84 million. These
   changes were positive for the coastal wetlands, equivalent to US\$
   258.95 million a year. Despite the negative value changes of the
   rangelands, the total ES value changes in the entire wetland during the
   years 1975 to 2013 were evaluated to be positive (equal to US\$ 244.96
   million). Changes in the value of the services of pollination,
   biological control, genetic resources, and food production in 2013 were
   negative, compared to 1975. This indicates the loss of these values,
   which is due to the loss of rangelands in the study area. The findings
   of this study can inform policymakers, managers, and environmental
   planners about the continuation of the changing process and may lead to
   the formulation of policies for the sustainable exploitation of land
   resources, as well as future effective land use planning for achieving
   the goals of sustainable development in the study area. The findings can
   serve as a tool for raising awareness about the contribution of nature
   to the benefits, social welfare, and livelihood of the stakeholders.}},

Abstract = {{While the ecological effects of pesticides have been well studied in
   honeybees, it is unclear to what extent other anthropogenic contaminants
   such as air pollution may also negatively affect bee cognition and
   behaviour. To answer this question, we assessed the impacts of acute
   exposure to four ecologically relevant concentrations of a common urban
   air pollutant-diesel generated air pollution on honeybee odour learning
   and memory using a conditioned proboscis extension response assay. The
   proportion of bees that successfully learnt odours following direct air
   pollution exposure was significantly lower in bees exposed to low,
   medium and high air pollutant concentrations, than in bees exposed to
   current ambient levels. Furthermore, short- and long-term odour memory
   was significantly impaired in bees exposed to low medium and high air
   pollutant concentrations than in bees exposed to current ambient levels.
   These results demonstrate a clear and direct cognitive cost of air
   pollution. Given learning and memory play significant roles in foraging,
   we suggest air pollution will have increasing negative impacts on the
   ecosystem services bees provide and may add to the current threats such

Abstract = {{Aim Bees play an important role in natural ecosystems and the world's
   food supply. In the past decades, bee abundance and diversity have
   declined globally. This has resulted in decreased pollination services
   for natural ecosystems and the agricultural sector at the field scale.
   One of the causes of the decline in bee abundance and diversity is the
   use of pesticides. Linking pesticide use, land use and bee presence
   could provide crucial insights into areas, and pesticides that pose a
   significant threat to the abundance and diversity of bees. Obtaining
   actual figures of farmer pesticide use is rarely possible. Therefore, we
   designed a method to study the effects of potential pesticide use on the
   survival and distribution of honeybees and bumblebees. Location The
   Netherlands. Methods A pesticide risk model was implemented
   incorporating a hazard quotient as the risk assessment. The number of
   allowed pesticide active ingredients per crop that could pose a risk to
   honeybees and bumblebees was linked to the Dutch crop parcel locations
   for 2015 and 2016. The potential pesticide risk maps were analysed using
   honeybee colony survival and bumblebee presence data. Results
   Non-significant negative effects of potential pesticide risk on honeybee
   colony survival and bumblebee presence were found. A significant
   negative effect of greenhouses was identified for both honeybees and
   bumblebees. The most important factors in the models predicting honeybee
   colony survival and bumblebee presence were urban land areas and natural
   grasslands, respectively, both showing a positive effect. Main
   conclusions Here, the first attempt to estimate and map pesticide risk
   to bees in the Netherlands in a country-wide manner is presented. The
   results could provide crucial high-resolution insights for bee
   conservation action and facilitate the increase of pollination services
   in natural ecosystems and the agricultural sector on a local and
   country-wide scale.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to understand the role of floral traits in determining
   the pollination and reproduction of Desmodium grahamii (Fabaceae,
   Papilionoideae) with explosive floral mechanism in populations occurring
   in a natural reserve and botanical garden in southern Mexico City. We
   assessed the breeding system by quantifying floral and pollinator
   activity, compatibility, pollination, and reproductive success, assisted
   by field and laboratory analyses. Results showed that cross-pollination
   and self-pollination coexist, but bees are required for fruit and seed
   set. Flower colour is the primary attractant. Floral scent is also
   likely important because the petals were covered with papillae, although
   no scent was perceptible. Morphological and functional observations of
   D. grahamii exhibit simultaneous pollen release and stigma receptivity
   when the flower is activated by a pollinator and there is no secondary
   pollen presentation; this contrasts with what has been reported on other
   species of Desmodium. Pollen is the pollinators' only reward, and its
   deposition and collection must be done synchronically, occurring when a
   bee lands and introduces its proboscis in the flower. In this study, we
   identified seven floral visitors: five bee pollinators and two syrphid
   flies as pollen thieves. On some occasions, Apis mellifera also behaves
   as a pollen thief. Fruit and seed set of flowers that were isolated from
   visitors may indicate a delayed pollination mechanism. Pollination
   results also suggest that Apis bees and syrphid flies may contribute to
   fruit and seed production when they forage on flowers at post-anthesis.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to increase the ecosystem services provided by
   a green roof by ameliorating the biological and chemical properties of a
   commercial green roof substrate through the addition of earthworms and
   compost. We conducted a mesocosm (120 x 80 x 33 cm) experiment with a
   plant community comprising Hylotelephium maximum,Centaurea jacea, Lotus
   corniculatus, Koeleria glauca, and Dianthus carthusianorum. Two
   substrates were compared (i) a low complexity commercial green roof
   substrate with no alterations and (ii) a high complexity substrate with
   a layer of locally produced vermicompost and earthworms (Lumbricus
   terrestris) placed on top of the commercial substrate. The mesocosms
   were placed on the roof of a 20 m high building and at ground level.
   Results show that the percent of vegetative cover on both substrates was
   lower in the roof mesocoms than on those placed at ground level. This is
   explained by climatic conditions, such as higher light intensity at roof
   level. The substrate with earthworms and vermicompost had significantly
   higher enzyme activity, microbial biomass, and metabolic activity. This
   resulted in more available nitrogen and phosphorus for plants, increased
   the plant biomass, floral nectar volume and sugar concentration which
   resulted in the flowers receiving more diverse and abundant insect
   pollinators. This is the first time that adding earthworms and compost
   to a green roof substrate has been shown to have a significant effect on
   plant growth and plant-pollinator interactions. These findings will help
   in designing green roof systems that are more efficient at preserving
   ecosystem services in urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{The financialization of urban development occurs even under conditions
   of credit constraint. The paper demonstrates that credit scarcity is an
   important and under-examined driver of policy improvisation and
   institutional development. Using the case of Tucson, Arizona, we show
   that local and extra-local interests overlap and cross-pollinate to
   produce unique hybrids ?? geographically specific and contingent
   institutional forms cultivated by local growth machines to attract
   outside financial interests. These dynamics are illustrated with a
   sales-tax-based tax increment financing district that employs ?enhanced
   financings? to attract extra-local sources of debt and equity. We find
   that the financialization of urban development in the credit-constrained
   city is not just a process of abstraction, but also of particularization
   in which extra-local dollars flow through embedded local networks. We
   conclude with a call for greater attention to the intersections of
   finance and urban life in ?ordinary cities?.}},

Abstract = {{Golf courses are among the largest, most ubiquitous highly maintained
   urban green spaces in the U.S. Although their primary function is
   recreation, a large portion of golf course land is not actively in use,
   which presents opportunities to create more ecologically functional
   areas. Golf courses around the world are converting these out-of-play
   areas to alternative habitats, but few do so using evidence that
   maximizes their benefit. Previous studies have investigated effects of
   conservation plantings on golf courses, but none have isolated the
   biological control services of flying natural enemies and few
   investigated effects on native bees. In this study, we ask if converting
   out-of-play maintained turfgrass areas into wildflower habitats
   increases bee and insect natural enemy abundance and diversity and their
   associated ecosystem services. We created wildflower habitats at two
   levels of species richness and compared their effects on insects within
   and around them to turfgrass plots. To quantify effects on biological
   control, we deployed sentinel prey Spodoptera frugiperda larvae,
   excluding ground-dwelling predators. As predicted, we found that
   converting turfgrasses to flowering habitats increased bees and natural
   enemies on golf courses. However, high wildflower species richness was
   an important factor in promoting native bees and natural enemies. We
   found that wildflower habitats, particularly those with highest floral
   richness, increased biological control rates in adjacent turfgrass areas
   by up to 50\% compared to turfgrass controls. Our results indicate that
   purposefully designed conservation plantings on golf courses can help
   support insect pollinators while also augmenting biological control of
   turfgrass pests.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Insects pollinate many globally important crops and therefore rapid and
   effective means to measure crop pollinators and pollination are required
   to support national monitoring schemes and allow localised measurements
   of pollinator supply and demand to crops. We tested user-friendly
   protocols for assessing pollinators and pollination in crops to better
   understand the capacity and willingness of a group of farmers and
   citizen scientists to implement such techniques in the field. We asked
   the different recorder groups including farmers and agronomists,
   non-expert volunteers and experienced researchers to complete three
   pollinator and pollination service assessment techniques: transect
   walks, pan trapping and pollinator exclusion and supplementary
   pollination. Recorders provided feedback on each method through a
   questionnaire and the data collected using different methods were
   compared. Our volunteer members of the public, and farmers and
   agronomists were able to implement all assessment techniques in apple,
   bean and oilseed rape fields. The experienced researchers and volunteer
   members of the public were more willing to record bumblebees to species
   level on transects than the farmers and agronomists. There was also a
   significant interaction between recorder and crop type for certain
   insect taxa demonstrating that in certain crops some taxa may be easier
   to record than others. All our recorder groups found transects and pan
   traps straightforward and enjoyable to implement. Our non-expert
   volunteers were willing to use pollinator exclusion and supplementary
   pollination techniques as part of a wider scheme, the farmers and
   agronomists who implemented the technique were less positive about
   applying this method more widely. We have demonstrated that volunteer
   recorders, including farmers and agronomists, can be engaged and are
   able to implement methods to assess pollinators and pollination,
   although additional training is necessary to ensure accurate species
   data collection. For the more direct and time consuming measures of
   pollination service, both training and additional support may be needed,
   particularly for farmers. The tools developed and tested here will be
   valuable for wider pollinator monitoring schemes and for integration
   into standard agronomic practices. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by

Title = {{The role of bats in pollination networks is influenced by landscape
   structure}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Nectarivorous bats are essential to the functioning to both agricultural
   and natural ecosystems in the tropics, yet these pollinator communities
   are declining as a result of habitat loss and hunting. Temporal
   variation and habitat changes lead to both roost and floral resource
   loss, which is the major driver of bat pollination decline. This study
   aims to determine how the bat pollination networks in mixed-fruit
   orchards are affected by flowering seasons and different land-use types.
   We estimated the abundance of nectarivorous and frugivorous bats using
   video observations to determine floral visitation rates from 18
   mixed-fruit orchards in Southern Thailand. Pollination networks were
   then created based on network level indices (number of interactions and
   specialisation) and species level indices (strength-dependence of plant
   on each bat, and generalised degree-the number of interactions per
   species divided by the number of possible interacting partners) for each
   bat group at each orchard. We found that specialisation in low season
   networks was higher than those from peak season. Nectarivorous bats
   showed higher levels of normalised degree, and strength than frugivorous
   bats. The normalised degree of frugivorous bats, but not nectarivorous
   bats increased with the proportion of urban area within 30 km radius.
   The strength of bats was positively correlated with the proportion of
   plantations within a 2 km radius. Our results show that both bat guilds
   are strongly integrated into pollination networks where they occur and
   provide evidence that increasing the area of plantation and urban alters
   the degree of generalization of pollinators which can significantly
   impact pollination success of plants. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Despite their diversity and abundance, the importance of native, forest
   bee communities to pollination services and inherent biological
   diversity conservation is often overlooked. We studied forest bee
   communities in Delaware and Pennsylvania, USA, to better understand how
   forest bee community structure varies with changing land use and
   microhabitat quality among small, urban and suburban forest fragments in
   the mid-Atlantic United States. Our hypotheses were that (1)
   microhabitat quality would affect relative abundance of bee taxa, (2)
   surrounding landscape composition would drive local patch
   colonization-extinction dynamics, and (3) forest patch size would not
   affect community structure and composition. We found a lack of spatial
   autocorrelation among forest patches, indicating the importance of
   individual fragments in the autonomous generation and/or maintenance of
   bee communities. Community analyses revealed the importance of both
   landscape context and microhabitat quality in defining forest bee
   communities. By partitioning beta diversity into its constituent
   components, we also found that landscape composition drove changes in
   the relative abundance of taxa, while both landscape and microhabitat
   characteristics significantly influenced species turnover. Neither
   landscape composition nor quality of the microhabitat influenced initial
   site occupancy or colonization-extinction dynamics. Bisected by
   highways, suburban neighborhoods, agricultural lands, and urban
   development, many urban and suburban forest patches in the eastern
   United States are similar in composition to our study sites. As many
   native forest bees have limited capacity for long-range movement between
   forest patches, these remaining forest fragments are critical to the
   conservation of unique and speciose forest bee communities.}},

Abstract = {{Suitable nest sites are a crucial habitat requirement of ground-nesting
   bees, but empirical studies of fossorial solitary bee nesting ecology in
   the UK are few in number. This study used a citizen science approach to
   overcome the logistical and temporal barriers associated with this type

   with the nesting aggregations of four fossorial solitary bee species in
   the UK. Three hundred and ninety-four records were submitted by the
   public between March and November 2017. Sixty percent (236) of these
   records were verified as indicative of active nesting aggregations of
   the target species. Overall, the species in this study demonstrated the
   capacity to nest within a broad range of environmental variables.
   Although Colletes hederae (Schmidt and Westrich 1993) was often reported
   from sloped, unshaded sites, and Andrena fulva (Muller in Allioni 1766)
   was regularly associated with flat, shaded locations. This study
   demonstrated the efficacy of a citizen science approach in surmounting
   the intrinsic difficulties associated with studying solitary bee nest

Abstract = {{In Central Europe, Helianthus tuberosus L. is a late summer/autumn
   bloomer (August/November). The disc florets produce both nectar and

   attractive to a variety of insect visitors (honey bees, wasps, flies and
   butterflies). The season of blooming as well as the total sugar yield
   (25.4 - 47.4 kg ha(-1)) and pollen yield (57.8 - 212.7 kg ha(-1))
   indicate that H. tuberosus is important in the enhancement of food
   resources for pollinators. The generative reproduction in H. tuberosus
   is impaired (the species does not set seeds/fruits). However, due to its
   attractiveness for a variety of pollinators in both rural and urban
   areas, the spread of H. tuberosus should be monitored. Moreover, its

Abstract = {{Bumble bees are among the most abundant and important wild pollinators
   in North America. Spring nest establishment is a brief and vulnerable
   stage in the colony life cycle that is poorly understood. Bumble bee
   nesting activity in temperate North America has received little recent
   attention, and this knowledge gap is a barrier to conservation efforts.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the habitat use, nesting
   phenology, and key food plants of spring bumble bee queens. Through 108
   nonlethal surveys of bumble bee queens in spring 2018, researchers
   observed 451 nest seeking and 555 foraging queens of nine species in
   Ohio, U.S.A. Spring queen activity began in mid-April and peaked in mid
   -May, although nest seekers were observed into late June. Nest seeking
   queens favored woody transitional habitats over open habitats. In
   accordance queen abundance and diversity increased with the proportion
   of forest in the surrounding landscape. The proportion of row crops and
   urban areas negatively influenced queen diversity and the number of nest
   seekers, respectively. Through a literature review, the earliest
   emergence dates for each species were compared for 12 datasets to
   establish an order of species emergence in northeastern North America.
   Fortyseven species of flowering plants were used by foraging queens.
   Highly visited food plants included both native and nonnatives({*}):
   Lupinus perennis, Malus spp., Taraxacum officinale{*}, Lanicera spp.{*},
   Larnium purpureum{*}, Glechoma hederacea{*}, Trifoliurn pratense{*}, and
   Mertensia vitginica. Systematic field surveys are needed by state to
   document the timing of spring queen emergence and nesting activities to
   inform conservation efforts.}},

Journal = {{ECOSYSTEM SERVICES}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Mountain ecosystems tend to have less human intervention and more
   abundant biodiversity and ecosystem services (ESs). With the development
   of urbanization, mountain ecotourism has become an important site of
   leisure for human beings. Understanding how recreationists perceive
   biodiversity and ESs is important for effective mountain ecotourism
   planning and eco-environment management. However, there are some
   difficulties in obtaining human perception data in larger mountain
   areas. This study collected social value data perceived by
   recreationists in Taibai Mountain National Forest Park (TMNFP) using
   questionnaires. On the basis of data of TMNFP and the Social Values for
   ESs model (SolVES), we evaluated the social values of the Qinling
   Mountains, where TMNFP is located. This assessment is expressed in terms
   of a value index (VI) and shows the relationship between the VI and
   environmental variables in a quantitative and spatially explicit manner.
   The results showed that the maximum VI (max-VI) of each social value of
   the Qinling Mountains was high, and the social values were mainly
   concentrated in areas with high altitude. At the same time, we used
   forest parks and nature reserves to verify the VIs of aesthetic,
   recreation and biodiversity. The results showed that the high
   aggregation degree of sample points was not conducive to value transfer.
   This study validates the extrapolation method (value transfer) can
   obtain the social value of large-scale area. These outcomes can help
   managers and planners to identify specific areas that need improvement.}},

Abstract = {{This study is the first meta-regression analysis of the economic value
   of regulating ecosystem services at the global level. Most of the
   regulating ecosystem services have not been properly estimated in terms
   of economic value and are also ignored in the everyday decision-making
   process. This study has reviewed 100 publications and included 275
   economic value estimates. This study includes explanatory variables in
   the meta-analysis to account for these influences on the estimated
   economic value of regulating ecosystem services. This study has
   estimated the economic value of regulating ecosystem services at

   of climate and water regulations are the highest contributors to the
   total value of regulating ecosystem services. This study indicates that
   the results of meta-analysis might be helpful to decision-making with
   respect to three aspects: first, planning and management of urban green
   cover for sustainable cities; second, integration of the economic value
   of all the regulating ecosystem services; third, budget allocation for

Abstract = {{1. Urban ecosystems create suitable habitats for many plant and animal
   species, including pollinators. However, heterogenic habitats in city
   centres and suburban areas have various effects on pollinators due to
   variations in the composition of vegetation and in landscape management
   by humans. 2. This study compared the abundance and species richness of
   three main groups of pollinators - wild bees, butterflies, and
   hoverflies - in Poznan, western Poland, and in three different types of
   urban green areas - urban grasslands, urban parks, and green
   infrastructure in housing estates. 3. The total abundance of pollinators
   was higher in urban grasslands than in housing estates and urban parks.
   Species composition of pollinator communities differed between the three
   habitat types. 4. The study results showed that species richness and
   abundance of butterflies varied between habitat types, whereas no such
   differences were found in the case of wild bees and hoverflies. Cover of
   green area, vegetation structure, and plant height were important for
   the pollinator community; however, these variables had different effects
   depending on habitat type. 5. These findings revealed that not all urban
   green areas are equally valuable in terms of local biodiversity.
   High-quality urban habitats such as urban grasslands are capable of
   supporting rich and abundant populations of pollinators. Therefore, it
   is important to protect high-value urban green areas and simultaneously
   strive to improve intensively managed urban habitats through effective
   planning and new management practices.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature in the progamic phase is critical for the success of plant
   sexual reproduction, and new knowledge is needed to optimise breeding
   programmes to obtain new varieties that adapt to a climate change
   scenario. Using three male donors and one female recipient in the genus
   Citrus, we evaluated the effect of four temperature regimes on each
   process in the progamic phase. An innovative method based on microscopic
   observations of cross sections from pollinated pistils collected daily
   allowed a comprehensive analysis of pollen tube growth (dynamics and
   kinetics) along the pistil. Pollen grain germination and stigmatic
   receptivity were evaluated directly on the stigma, which offers more
   accurate information than previously reported in vitro experiments. Our
   results showed that warm temperatures reduce the time needed by pollen
   tubes to reach ovules and accelerate pistil degeneration, while cold
   temperatures produce the opposite effects. Interestingly, we observed
   both pollen grain germination and pollen tube growth at 10 degrees C,
   which have not been observed in previous studies in citrus. At this
   temperature, the differences observed in both pollen grain germination
   and pollen tube growth for different genotypes reflect the adaptation of
   their sporophytic generation to low temperatures which would enable
   gametophytic screening to be used as a tool to select better adapted
   genotypes to different temperature conditions. The differences observed
   in the growth rates between pollen tubes in each genotype-temperature
   combination provide an opportunity to explore additional gametophytic
   selection in this reproductive phase. The capacity to respond to
   temperature changes in the progamic phase to ensure mating can be useful
   for breeding programs that focus on obtaining better adapted populations
   to different temperature conditions.}},

Title = {{Botanical Origin of Pesticide Residues in Pollen Loads Collected by
   Honeybees During and After Apple Bloom}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Honeybees closely rely on insect-pollinated plants for their survival.
   Each forager bee displays a tendency of loyalty toward specific plant
   species during the many daily foraging flights. Due to the ease of
   collection, pollen loads have been extensively used as a proxy for
   detection of pesticide residues. Pollen is the main protein food source
   for colonies, and its contamination has also been addressed as a reason
   for the colony losses phenomenon. As honeybees fly over a variable but
   wide range territory, they might collect pollen from both agricultural,
   urban and wild environments, also displaying considerable preferences in
   botanical sources between colonies of the same apiary. It is thus
   difficult to address the source of the pesticide contamination, when
   pollen is analyzed as a whole. In the current study, a practical and
   reliable approach has been proposed to narrow down the source of
   contamination. Pollen loads have been collected from colonies placed in
   eight locations over large apple orchard extensions in Trentino-South
   Tyrol region (Italy), during and 2 weeks after apple blossom. The pollen
   loads have been separated by the color due to the predominant plant
   species. On each color group, palynology and multi-residual chemical
   analyses have been performed in parallel. The pollen hazard quotient
   (PHQ) was used to estimate the risk to honeybees of each color group and
   of the total collected pollen. Apple and dandelion pollen were the main
   portions of the first collection, while a greater variety emerged after
   the apple blossom. Dandelion was always present in the samples. The
   frequency and the amount of pesticide residues differed according to the
   collection periods, the locations and the pollen color groups. The
   amount of insecticide residues increased after the apple blossom, while
   no difference between the period was found on fungicide residues. The
   PHQ values were higher after the blossom due to the insecticide
   contribution, with highest values of 160,000 and 150,000. The variations
   within samples did not allow to identify a unique source of
   contamination, whereas it seems that the pollen from plants outside the
   agricultural areas has as much residues as the pollen from apple
   orchards.}},

Abstract = {{Feng Shui woodlands are naturally or artificially formed green areas in
   southern China. They are precious for maintaining ecosystem balance in
   modern semiurban environments. However, they are generally small and
   geographically isolated from each other, and the status of genetic
   diversity of the plant species within them has been almost neglected.
   Therefore, we studied the genetic diversity of the endangered
   Erythrophleum fordii in eight Feng Shui woodlands (a total of 1,061
   individuals) in Guangzhou, a large city in southern China, using
   microsatellites. For comparison, one population with 33 individuals
   sampled in a nature reserve was also studied. Although our results
   indicate that significant demographic declines occurred historically in
   E. fordii, such declines have not resulted in consistent reductions in
   genetic variation over generations in Feng Shui populations in the
   recent past, and the levels of genetic variation in these populations
   were higher than or comparable to the genetic variation of the
   population in the nature reserve. In addition, our parentage and
   paternity analyses indicated widespread and potential long-distance
   pollen flow within one Feng Shui woodland, indicating the presence of an
   unbroken pollination network, which would at least partially alleviate
   the genetic erosion due to habitat fragmentation and the unequal gene
   contributions of E. fordii parents to their progenies when favorable
   recruitment habitats are absent under most of the parent trees. Overall,
   our results suggest that E. fordii in Feng Shui woodlands may not be
   driven to extinction in the near future. Nevertheless, uncontrolled fast
   urban development with a lack of awareness of Feng Shui woodlands will
   cause the local extinction of E. fordii, which has already happened in
   some Feng Shui woodlands.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is an important plant-animal interaction, and moths
   (Lepidoptera) are frequent flower visitors. With 11,000 moth species in
   North America, this group of organisms has potential to largely
   influence the plant communities they exist in. To date, most pollination
   research has focused on diurnal (day active) pollinators. However,
   nocturnal plant visitors, such as moths, may represent a significant and
   underreported portion of plant-animal interactions. Understanding the
   role of nocturnal pollinators in ecological communities is important for
   informing conservation practices as well as making predictions for how
   plant-insect interaction networks may shift in response to environmental
   changes, which may be especially important in disturbed habitats like
   urban gardens. We aimed to address this gap in our understanding by
   surveying moth-plant interactions in urban environments. We collected
   260 moths over a two-year period, 68\% of which were carrying pollen. By
   family-88\% of Erebidae species, 89\% of Noctuid species, and 92\% of
   Geometrid species were pollen carriers. We conclude that moths

Abstract = {{The status of pollinating insects is of international concern, but
   knowledge of the magnitude and extent of declines is limited by a lack
   of systematic monitoring. Standardized protocols are urgently needed,
   alongside a better understanding of how different methods and recorders
   (data collectors) influence estimates of pollinator abundance and
   diversity. We compared two common methods for sampling wild pollinating
   insects (solitary bees, bumblebees and hoverflies), pan traps and
   transects, in surveys of 1 km countryside squares (agricultural and
   semi-natural habitats) and flowering crop fields across Great Britain,
   including the influence of local floral resources (nectar sugar
   availability or crop flower density) on the insects sampled. Further, we
   compared the performance of recorders with differing expertise
   (non-specialist research staff, taxonomic experts and non-expert
   volunteers) in applying methods. Pan traps and transects produced
   compositionally distinct samples of pollinator communities. In the wider
   countryside, pan traps sampled more species of solitary bee and
   hoverfly. In flowering crops, transects recorded a greater number of
   individual bumblebees, but fewer species. Across all taxonomic groups
   and countryside and crop samples, transects generally had lower rates of
   species accumulation per individual collected than pan traps. This
   demonstrates that differences between methods in estimating richness are
   not due to sampling effort alone. However, recorders possessing greater
   taxonomic expertise can produce species accumulation data from transects
   that are almost commensurate with pan trapping. The abundance and
   species richness of pollinators (except solitary bees) on transects in
   the wider countryside was positively related to the availability of
   estimated nectar sugar. In crops, pollinator abundance responses to
   flower densities were idiosyncratic according to crop type, but overall
   the response was positive and negative for transects and pan traps,
   respectively. Given these taxonomic and context-specific differences in
   method performance, we assess their suitability for monitoring
   pollinating insect communities and pollination services. We discuss the
   relevance of these findings within the context of achieving
   standardized, large-scale monitoring of pollinating insects.}},

Abstract = {{We are currently facing myriad socio-ecological crises, from global
   climate change to resource depletion to the loss of dozens of species
   every day. Despite a longstanding and impassioned environmental
   movement, these problems persist and are worsening. The extent and
   degree of human-induced change on the planet is significant enough to
   have placed us in a new geological age: the Anthropocene. Three
   perspectives are engaged as a way to understand this new era and address
   our fractured human-nature relationship: (1) political ecology, (2) the
   ecological humanities, and (3) the informal economy. An exploration of
   intersecting themes leads to the start of a new theoretical
   contribution, which manifests at the convergence of theories: a
   ``whole-of-community{''} approach. This whole-of-community approach is
   one that is concerned with both inter-human and interspecies
   relationships to move us towards communities that are place-based,
   integrated, participatory, and grounded in eco-social justice and
   equity. Pollinating bees are used as an illustrative example of how to
   achieve this vision. Bees can be both a bridge and gateway. As a bridge,
   they can provide a way of (re)connecting human and nonhuman nature and
   as a gateway, they can guide humans to a deeper understanding and
   connection with urban natures. Reconciling humans with the rest of the
   biotic community through place-based initiatives is possible by
   fundamentally and radically expanding our current framing of the concept
   of community.}},

Title = {{Diet profiling of house-farm swiftlets (Aves, Apodidae, Aerodramus sp.)
   in three landscapes in Perak, Malaysia, using high-throughput sequencing}},

Abstract = {{In Peninsular Malaysia, from the 1980s there has been progressive
   expansion of an industry based on specially designed buildings to house
   colonies of edible-nest swiftlets (Apodidae, Collocaliini). The
   structures are termed house-farms and the birds, house-farm swiftlets.
   Genetic research has so far failed to establish affinity with any wild
   form of swiftlets that builds `white' edible nests; we therefore
   identify house-farm swiftlets only as Aerodramus sp. The diet profiles
   of house-farm swiftlets were compared in different landscapes in Perak
   State, Malaysia, using a high-throughput sequencing of total DNA
   extracted from faecal samples collected at six house-farms, located at
   Beruas, Gopeng, Ipoh and Pantai Remis, in the month of October 2017.
   Landscape profiles of the presumed foraging area within 6 km radius of
   these six sites were estimated using Google MyMaps, and categorised as
   urban, monocrop or mixed-use. Based on the partial mitochondrial
   cytochrome oxidase I region (ca. 218-bp), 4852 operational taxonomic
   units (OTUs) were recovered, of which 266 belonged to arthropods.
   Overall, the diets of house-farm swiftlets assessed in this study mainly
   comprised Diptera (64.49\%), followed by Hemiptera (16.73\%), Coleoptera
   (13.47\%), Lepidoptera (2.04\%), Hymenoptera (1.63\%), Blattodea
   (0.82\%) and Odonata (0.82\%). Ipoh (urban landscape) and Pantai Remis
   (mixed) recorded the highest diversity of dietary insects. Presence of
   the aquatic insect families in these diets may reflect extensive
   freshwater bodies in the urban landscape. Coleoptera and Hemiptera were
   found to be dominant in the swiftlet diets at two monocrop landscapes
   Beruas OP1 and Beruas OP2, but did not include the weevil Elaeidobius
   kamerunicus, an important pollinator of oil palm. Results confirm that
   house-farm swiftlets are opportunistic feeders, so that variation in the
   diet profiles in Perak reflected the availability of insect prey within
   the landscapes of the foraging ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fragmentation can reduce population size, affecting the plant
   species and their biological interactions. We evaluated the effects of
   fragmentation on Ficus adhatodifolia Schott ex Spreng population, aiming
   to answer two questions: (1) is population size sufficient to maintain
   reproductive fig trees throughout the year? (2) Is the mean seed
   production per syconium higher in the larger forest fragments? Fifty-six
   trees of F. adhatodifolia were visited in a year, in five fragments and
   one urban area in southern Brazil. Mature syconia were collected and the
   seed and wasp production between areas were compared. Considering all
   forest remnants, we recorded syconia production throughout the year, but
   no fragment exhibited crop production in all months. The pollinator
   wasps Tetrapus sp. were found in almost all syconium, thus, indicating
   that Ficus-pollinator mutualism was not lost. Nevertheless, smaller
   fragments were not capable of maintaining reproductive individuals
   throughout the year, therefore, requiring pollinator wasps from other
   fragments. The size of fragments did not influence seed production
   {[}LRT P value = 0.1; LR stat (chi(2)) = 4.64; n = 370]. Factors such as
   Ficus resilience and pollinating wasp migration may have contributed to
   the support of mutualism so far. Therefore, in highly fragmented
   landscapes such as the study region, the conservation of all forest
   remnants is essential to mutualistic interaction preservation. This
   procedure combined with the restoration of degraded areas determined by
   law are urgent and necessary for the conservation of regional
   biodiversity.}},

Title = {{Parietaria major allergens vs pollen in the air we breathe}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{176}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Parietaria and Urtica are the genera from the Urticaceae
   family more frequent in Mediterranean and Atlantic areas. Moreover, both
   genera share pollination periods, and their pollen (of the main species)
   is so similar that there is no aerobiological evidence of the proportion
   of each of them in the airborne pollen identification, except in the
   case of U. membranacea. However, Parietaria is one of the most important
   causes of pollinosis and Urtica is not. Our aim is determine if airborne
   Urticaceae pollen concentrations show the aerodynamics of the two major
   allergens of Parietaria (Par j 1 and Par j 2) as well as the allergen
   distribution in the different-sized particles.
   Methods: The air was sampled during the pollination period of Urticaceae
   using Hirst Volumetric Sampler and Andersen Cascade Impactor in two
   cities of Southern Spain (Cordoba and Granada). The samples were
   analysed by the methodology proposed by the Spanish Aerobiology Network
   (REA) and the minimum requirements of the European Aeroallergen Society
   (EAS) for pollen, and by ELISA immunoassay for allergens.
   Results: The patterns of airborne pollen and Par j 1-Par j 2 were
   present in the air during the studied period, although with irregular
   oscillations. Urticaceae pollen and Par j 1-Par j 2 allergens located in
   PM2.5 showed positive and significant correlation during the period with
   maximum concentrations (March to April).
   Conclusion: Parietaria aeroallergens show similar pattern of Urticaceae
   airborne pollen. Urticaceae pollen calendar is as a good tool for
   allergy prevention. On the other hand, important concentrations of Par j
   1 and Par j 2 were located in the breathable fraction (PM2.5), which
   could explain the asthmatic symptoms in the allergic population to
   Parietaria.}},

Abstract = {{The aroma quality of citrus fruit is determined by volatiles that are
   present at extremely low levels in the citrus fruit juice sacs; it can
   be greatly improved by increasing volatiles. In this study, we showed
   that the contents of cis- and translinalool oxides were significantly
   increased in the juice sacs of three pummelos artificially pollinated
   with the Citrus mangshanensis (MS) pollen. A novel cytochrome P450 78A7
   gene (CitLO1) was significantly upregulated in the juice sacs of Huanong
   Red pummelo pollinated with MS pollen in comparison to that with open
   pollination. Compared to wild-type tobacco Bright-Yellow2 cells,
   transgenic cells overexpressing CitLO1 promoted a 3- to 4-fold more
   conversion of (-)-linalool to cis- and trans-linalool oxides. Overall,
   our results suggest that MS pollen has a xenia effect on pummelo fruit
   aroma quality, and CitLO1 is a linalool oxide synthase gene that played
   an important role in the xenia effect.}},

Abstract = {{This study brings together data from a series of local pollinator
   surveys undertaken in major conventionally-managed agricultural crops in
   Brazil to determine the presence and abundance of bees visiting flowers
   within crops compared with adjacent off-crop habitats. Surveys were
   undertaken within crops and in adjacent off-crop areas using broadly the
   same methodology in flowering soybean, drybean, maize, citrus, coffee,
   rice, and cotton and in sugarcane immediately after harvest. The bee
   species present were assessed twice per day at three times during crop
   flowering (post-harvest for sugar-cane). Pan traps were used to collect
   species present within the crop and off-crop twice per day. Drybeans,
   citrus, and coffee flowers displayed a consistent medium to high
   abundance of honey bees based on effort-adjusted transect and spot
   counts. In contrast, fields with flowering soybeans and cotton showed
   in-crop lower abundance and rice, corn, and harvested sugar cane showed
   consistently low numbers or no honey bees. In almost all cases honey
   bees were the most prevalent and abundant flower visitors within the
   studied crops. Where non-Apis bees were observed they often belong to
   the Meliponini (primarily Trigona) or the genera Bombus or Xylocopa. The
   off-crop assessments of species presence using pan traps showed a far
   wider diversity of species with greater proportional representation of
   solitary bee species. Overall, whilst honey bees accounted for the
   majority of observed bees visiting flowers in the agricultural fields,
   the off-crop habitat contained a greater abundance and diversity of
   non-Apis bee populations.}},

Abstract = {{Pest control in agriculture is mainly based on the application of
   insecticides, which may impact nontarget beneficial organisms leading to
   undesirable ecological effects. Neonicotinoids are among the most widely
   used insecticides. However, they have important negative side effects,
   especially for pollinators and other beneficial insects feeding on
   nectar. Here, we identify a more accessible exposure route:
   Neonicotinoids reach and kill beneficial insects that feed on the most
   abundant carbohydrate source for insects in agroecosystems, honeydew.
   Honeydew is the excretion product of phloem-feeding hemipteran insects
   such as aphids, mealybugs, whiteflies, and psyllids. We allowed
   parasitic wasps and pollinating hoverflies to feed on honeydew from
   hemipterans feeding on trees treated with thiamethoxam or imidacloprid,
   the most commonly used neonicotinoids. LC-MS/MS analyses demonstrated
   that both neonicotinoids were present in honeydew. Honeydew with
   thiamethoxam was highly toxic to both species of beneficial insects, and
   honeydew with imidacloprid was moderately toxic to hoverflies.
   Collectively, our data provide strong evidence for honeydew as a route
   of insecticide exposure that may cause acute or chronic deleterious

Abstract = {{Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency due to the warming
   climate. Such extremities can jeopardize ecosystem services and create
   economic imbalances. Tropical developing countries are predicted to
   suffer the maximum consequences of such events. We examined the impact
   of such an event-extreme rainfall fluctuation-on a critical ecosystem
   service-pollination, which can be intricately linked to a country's
   economy. We performed this study in a dominant peri-urban vegetable hub
   of an agriculture-dependent developing country. We found that the yield
   of all pollinator-dependent crops grown across a large spatial scale
   (district) over multiple years (six) drastically declined with the
   decrease in rainfall. At the local scale, we found that the dominant
   crop (representative horticultural crop) had a significant drop in yield
   during drought, likely due to the production of fewer female flowers and
   a significant shift in the pollinator community. We found that Trigona
   sp. (one of the four pollinators) was the critical pollinator positively
   influencing fruit-to-flower ratio (FFR) (an indicator of pollination
   service) in the normal rainfall year. However, despite its sharp decline
   during drought, the FFR remained unaffected. We found that during
   drought, Apis dorsata was crucial in maintaining FFR and compensated for
   the decline of the critical pollinator across 67\% farmlands. Our study
   demonstrates the role of ecosystem stabilizing mechanism rescuing the
   crucial ecosystem service during climatic variability over the temporal
   scale.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic activities in urban ecosystems induce a myriad of
   environmental changes compared with adjacent rural areas. These
   environmental changes can be seen as series of abiotic and biotic
   selection filters affecting the distribution of plant species. What are
   the attributes of plant species that compose urban communities, compared
   with rural communities, as related to their ecological affinities (e.g.,
   to temperature, humidity), and reproductive traits (e.g., entomophily,
   autogamy, floral morphology)? Using a floristic dataset from a citizen
   science project recording plant species growing spontaneously in the
   streets, we analyzed the distribution of species according to their
   ecological requirements and reproductive traits along an urbanization
   gradient in the Parisian region. We developed an original floral and
   pollinator typology composed of five floral and four pollinator
   morphotypes. The proportion of impervious areas, used as a proxy of
   urbanization, was measured at different spatial scales, to reveal at
   which spatial scales urbanization is selecting plant traits. We found
   significant differences in plant communities along the urbanization
   gradient. As expected with the warmer and drier conditions of urban
   areas, species with higher affinities to higher temperature, light and
   nutrient soil content, and lower atmospheric moisture were
   over-represented in urban plant communities. Interestingly, all of the
   significant changes in plant abiotical affinities were the most
   pronounced at the largest scale of analysis (1,000 m buffer radius),
   probably because the specific urban conditions are more pronounced when
   they occur on a large surface. The proportion of autogamous,
   self-compatible, and nonentomophilous species was significantly higher
   in urban plant communities, strongly suggesting a lower abundance or
   efficiency of the pollinating fauna in urban environments. Last, among
   insect-pollinated species, those with relatively long and narrow tubular
   corollas were disadvantaged in urban areas, possibly resulting from a
   reduction in pollinator abundance particularly affecting specialized
   plant-pollinator interactions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH}},

Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus Thunb.) is an important economic crop with
   29.6 million tons produced worldwide. However, few native bees and other
   pollinators have been documented to visit watermelon flowers and the
   contribution of these insects to watermelon pollination has yet to be
   determined. We examined 40 commercial watermelon fields from 2013 to
   2016 and obtained information on pollinator visitation rates for managed
   and wild pollinators at different distances from field margins. We
   determined the amount of pollen on common pollinators' bodies, how much
   time these pollinators spent on flowers, and the amount of pollen they
   deposited on stigmas. Forty-three species of potential pollinators were
   documented during the 4-year study. Managed honey bees (Apis mellifera
   L.) were the most common visitor, but numerous other pollinators (e.g.,
   Agapostemon splendens Lepeletier, Campsomeris plumipes var. fossulana
   Fabricius) were found to be abundant. This sweat bee and scoliid wasp
   carried as much watermelon pollen as worker A. mellifera did. No
   differences were detected among visitation rates among various taxonomic
   groups at different distances (0, 25, 50, 100m) from field margins
   except for small bees (e.g., Lasioglossum, Halictus), which were found
   in higher abundances at the field margins. Managed and wild bumble bees
   (Bombus spp.) were not common visitors of watermelons and may not be a
   good surrogate for managed honey bees. Overall, numerous insect species
   contribute to watermelon pollination. Therefore, watermelon growers
   should consider future land-use changes or other management practices
   that might positively affect the abundances of bee and wasp species.}},

Title = {{Pollinator-Mediated Gene Flow Connects Green Roof Populations Across the
   Urban Matrix: A Paternity Analysis of the Self-Compatible Forb Penstemon
   hirsutus}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Gene flow between populations can help maintain genetic diversity and
   prevent inbreeding, which is especially important for small, fragmented
   habitats. Many plant species rely on pollinators to move pollen between
   populations. In urban areas, insufficient pollinator services may result
   in limited gene flow, which can have negative consequences such as
   genetic drift and inbreeding depression. Furthermore, restored
   populations that are established with few founders of low genetic
   diversity may have limited long-term population persistence. Here, we
   tested the hypotheses that populations of a self-compatible forb
   established on urban green roofs from nursery stock are genetically
   depauperate and that limited gene (pollen) flow between populations will
   result in increased inbreeding. We compared the neutral genetic
   diversity of Penstemon hirsutus, using nine microsatellite loci, between
   three green roof populations established from nursery stock and three
   natural populations. We also established ten experimental populations on
   green roofs and measured rates of outcrossing and inbreeding and
   identified the movement of pollen within and between roofs using a
   paternity analysis. We found that neutral genetic diversity of
   populations established from nursery stock was lower than that of
   natural populations, although the level of inbreeding was also lower on
   the green roofs. In our experimental populations, we found that the
   rates of outcrossing and inbreeding varied between the roof populations.
   Our results suggest that inbreeding may be correlated with cover of
   co-flowering species but not with any of the other measured site
   properties. The location of likely pollen donors suggested that on
   average, 75\% of pollen was derived from plants within the population
   (including self) and 25\% came from plants on different roofs. Our
   results document realized pollen movement within and between green
   roofs, demonstrating that these habitats provide important connectivity
   in a fragmented environment.}},

Abstract = {{Acacia mearnsii is a commercial forestry tree in South Africa, largely
   grown from open-pollinated seeds. Clonal deployment of superior
   selections of the species is restricted due to its poor rooting ability.
   The effects of conditioning parent hedge-plants under three levels of
   reduced light (80\% black; 60\% red and 40\% black/ white shadenet) were
   investigated. Hedge-plant nutrition, carbohydrate content, productivity
   and rooting of cuttings were measured. Conditioning hedge-plants under
   80\% black shadenet for five weeks gave the highest rooting percentages
   in both seasons (39.3\% and 22.1\%) (p < 0.05), despite having a lower
   productivity of 42.5 cuttings per hedge-plant (p > 0.05). As the shading
   increased to 80\% black, so the rooting increased, and stem/leaf total
   non-structural carbohydrate levels decreased (r = -0.61 to -0.97).
   Conditioning under shadenet reduced leaf and increased stem total
   macronutrient percentages but increased both leaf and stem total
   micronutrient concentrations. Total macro- and micronutrient levels were
   greatest after conditioning under 80\% black shadenet, except for
   stem-nitrogen, stem-carbon and leaf-manganese, which had the lowest
   values (p > 0.05). In conclusion, hedge-plant conditioning under 80\%
   black shadenet can significantly improve rooting of A. mearnsii
   cuttings, which could facilitate the commercial clonal propagation of
   the species.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we supply raw data on the reproductive biology and
   frequency of pollinators of Paubrasilia echinata, a threatened tree,
   endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic forest, which is largely used in
   Brazilian urban areas (e.g. avenues, parks and squares) due to its
   ornamental potential. Specifically, we share data on the reproductive
   phenology, pollen/flower, floral visitors and seed set of P. echinata in
   urban and natural ecosystems. This dataset article is related to the
   original research article ``Reduced reproductive success of the
   endangered tree brazilwood (Paubrasilia echinata, Leguminosae) in urban
   ecosystem compared to Atlantic forest remnant: lessons for tropical
   urban ecology{''} (Oliveira et al., 2019). As urbanization is thought to
   negatively impact the maintenance of plant communities by affecting
   ecological key interactions, such as pollination, we believe that data
   as the supplied here are relevant and could support the planning of
   urban green spaces to maintain viable communities of plants and animals.
   This is especially valid for tropical urban ecosystems since most of the
   studies on plant ecology have been developed in temperate regions and
   there are still several gaps on the knowledge of ecological functions
   and ecosystems services (e.g. pollination) in urban green areas in the

Title = {{Floral reward and insect visitors in six ornamental Lonicera species -
   Plants suitable for urban bee-friendly gardens}},
Journal = {{URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Pollinator decline is a global threat with serious consequences to
   biodiversity. Mosaic structure of urban habitats and greenery areas are
   regarded beneficial for insects. However, for proper
   `pollinator-friendly' management of urban areas, detailed information on
   floral reward offered by particular plant species is required. In this
   paper floral rewards of six ornamental Lonicera species
   (Caprifoliaceae), growing in the city of Lublin, SE Poland, were
   investigated. In this temperate zone, the investigated Lonicera species
   bloomed during May-June or May-October and could be considered as
   valuable food resources for pollinating insects. The mean amount of
   nectar sugars per shrub ranged 8.6-66.3 g (L. caprifolium - L. maackii,
   respectively). The mean pollen yield was 2.1-110.1 g per shrub (L.
   xylosteum - L. maackii, respectively). Due to considerable differences
   in corolla depth, Lonicera species attracted diverse groups of insect
   visitors, i.e. short-corolla species represented morning pattern of
   flower opening and attracted mainly honey bees and bumble bees, while
   long-corolla species opened in the evening and lured Apoidea,
   butterflies (mainly hawkmoths), and sporadically wasps, syrphid flies
   and beetles. Two high sugar- and pollen-yielding species, L. maackii and
   L. tatarica, are however regarded invasive in some geographical areas.
   Therefore, the spread of the species should be carefully monitored in
   urban green areas.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination of 20 common terrestrial orchids was studied in a 60-ha
   urban banksia and eucalypt dominated woodland in Western Australia. Five
   years of data (24,000 flowers, 6800 plants) measured fruit set relative
   to floral areas, capsule volumes, climate, phenology, pollination
   mechanisms, disturbance tolerance and demography. Pollination varied
   from 0-95\% of flowers, floral displays from 90-3300 mm(2) and capsules
   from 15-1300 mm(3) per spike. Pollination traits strongly influenced
   outcomes, with self-pollination highest (59-95\%), followed by sexually
   deceptive autumn or winter-flowering (18-39\%), visual deception
   (0-48\%) and sexually deceptive spring-flowering (13-16\%). Pollination
   was limited by drought in autumn or spring and cool winter temperatures.
   Some orchids were resilient to drought and one formed seed after the
   leaves withered. Plant density had the greatest impact on fruit set for
   orchids forming large groups, especially for sexually deceptive
   pollination. Consequently, small group average (SGA) pollination was up
   to 4x greater than overall averages and peak seed production occurred in
   the best locations for genetic exchange and dispersal. SGA rates and
   seedpod volumes were strongly linked to clonality, but not to
   demographic trends. Resource competition limited flowering at higher
   plant densities and competition within spikes resulted in smaller,
   later-forming seedpods. Pollination data from co-occurring common
   orchids identified five evolutionary trade-offs linked to pollination,
   provided baseline data for rare species and revealed impacts of changing
   climate.}},

Volume = {{190}},

Abstract = {{Current declines in the abundance and diversity of bees and other
   pollinators has created uncertainty in their ability to reliably deliver
   pollination services. Recent studies examining urban bee diversity have
   provided conflicting results, with some studies identifying parts of
   cities with high bee diversity and others documenting reduced diversity
   with high levels of urbanization, with potential effects on surrounding
   agricultural areas. However, these studies have not specifically
   investigated pollination services, or examined the influence of local
   habitat conditions on these services. We surveyed urban gardens and city
   parks across the metropolitan region of Toledo, Ohio (USA) to understand
   how urbanization (impervious surface) and local habitat characteristics
   (herbaceous cover, floral abundance and color, tree abundance, canopy
   cover, soil moisture, garden size) impact bee communities (abundance,
   diversity, composition) and pollination services (visitation frequency).
   We collected 729 bees representing 19 genera and 57 species. We found
   that bee community composition was strongly associated with percent
   impervious surface. Bee abundance declined with increased canopy cover
   and impervious surface, while declines in bee diversity with increasing
   impervious surface were greatly reduced by increases in floral
   resources. Visitation rates were positively correlated with bee
   abundance and diversity, declining with increased impervious surface,
   but increasing with floral resource availability. These results suggest
   that increasing floral resources at high impervious sites may counteract
   the negative effects of impervious surface on bee diversity and
   pollination services in cities similar to Toledo, OH.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Target-selective biopesticides are needed to facilitate
   integrated pest and pollinator management in urban landscapes and
   gardens. Bacillus thuringiensis galleriae, strain SDS-502 (Btg),
   recently registered in the USA and Canada, produces Cry8Da protein
   active against scarab beetles. We evaluated Btg formulations for
   managing the Japanese beetle {[}Popillia japonica Newman (JB)], a
   polyphagous invasive pest, including residual spray effectiveness for
   reducing adult feeding on Rosa and Tilia spp., and granular formulations
   for early- or late-curative control of root-feeding grubs in turfgrass.
   We also tested for cross-order activity to monarch butterfly (Danaus
   plexippus L.) larvae and other non-target insects. RESULTS
   Field-weathered Btg residues reduced JB feeding on foliage for 3-14
   days. Most beetles were still flight-capable after 24 h confinement with
   Btg-treated leaves. Granular Btg failed to control early- or late-instar
   JB grubs in soils under several turfgrass species at multiple field
   sites. In three trials, feeding on Btg-sprayed milkweed resulted in
   97-100\% mortality of early instar monarchs, with symptoms of B.
   thuringiensis pathogenesis. Fall armyworms (Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E.
   Smith)) fed Btg-treated grass had reduced body mass, but there were no
   adverse effects on lady beetle larvae preying on Btg-sprayed aphids or
   on the aphids themselves. CONCLUSION This study supports efficacy of Btg
   strain SDS-502 for reducing defoliation by adult JB in urban landscape
   settings. Granular formulations, however, failed to control JB grubs in
   turfgrass soils. Btg should not be used in gardens with larval host
   plants of the monarch butterfly or other non-pest Lepidoptera,
   especially species of conservation concern. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the spherical traveling salesman problem. In this
   problem, all cities are located on the surface of a sphere and the
   cities must be visited exactly once in a tour. We propose a new and
   effective meta-heuristic algorithm with greedy behavior for solving this
   problem. The proposed algorithm is based on the discrete flower
   pollination algorithm, which is a bio-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm
   enhanced by order-based crossover, pollen discarding behavior and
   partial behaviors. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, it is compared
   with four effective existing algorithms (the genetic algorithm, two
   variants of the genetic algorithm and tabu search) on a set of available
   spherical traveling salesman instances. The results show the superiority
   of our algorithm in both solution quality and robustness of the
   solutions.}},

Title = {{Conserving bees in destroyed landscapes: The potentials of reclaimed
   sand mines}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Sand mines represent anthropogenically impacted habitats found
   worldwide, which bear potential for bee conservation. Although floral
   resources can be limited at these habitats, vegetation free patches of
   open sandy soils and embankments may offer good nesting possibilities
   for sand restricted and other bees. We compared bee communities as found
   in three reclaimed sand mines and at adjacent roadside meadows in
   Maryland, USA, over two years. Both sand mines and roadsides hosted
   diverse bee communities with 111 and 88 bee species, respectively. Bee
   abundances as well as richness and Shannon diversity of bee species were
   higher in sand mines than at roadsides and negatively correlated with
   the percentage of vegetational ground cover. Species composition also
   differed significantly between habitats. Sand mines hosted a higher
   proportion of ground nesters, more uncommon and more `sand loving' bees
   similar to natural sandy areas of Maryland. Despite the destruction of
   the original pre-mining habitat, sand mines thus appear to represent a
   unique habitat for wild bees, particularly when natural vegetation and
   open sand spots are encouraged. Considering habitat loss, the lack of
   natural disturbance regimes, and ongoing declines of wild bees, sand
   mines could add promising opportunities for bee conservation which has
   hitherto mainly focused on agricultural and urban habitats. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {{Ever-faster rates of urbanization have led to the substantial loss of
   agricultural land and natural areas. Furthermore, vegetated land is
   often fragmented and dominated by nonnative plant species within urban
   areas, which is likely to impact plant-pollinator interactions. However,
   the study of plant-pollinator interactions is labor intensive and
   remains challenging. Here, we compared plant species visited by
   honeybees in urban versus non-urban sites, using metabarcoding to
   identify pollen in honey samples. We identified a total of 262 plant
   genera, 15 of which were represented predominantly. Samples varied
   greatly in terms of plant composition, the number of nonnative genera
   and the number of crop plant genera. Even though land cover differed
   between urban and non-urban sites, plant diversity in the honey did not.
   We discuss our results in the light of challenges associated with the
   spatial scale of bee activity, preference behavior in flower visitation,
   and statistical power.}},

Abstract = {{ContextUrban-rural gradients provide a suitable framework for studying
   the provision of urban and rural ecosystem services (ES), linked to
   social welfare. Landscape structure (LS) changes along urban-rural
   gradients but our understanding of the effects of LS on ES remains at an
   early stage.ObjectivesWe have quantified the relationship between
   changes in LS and ES supply along an urban-rural gradient in Central
   Spain, and compared the intensity of change with the land conservation
   status, degree of urbanization and proximity to Madrid city.MethodsWe
   inferred the provision of ES at municipality level based on proxies from
   socio-economic data and land use maps, and characterized LS through
   metrics calculated from Corine land cover maps at two dates. We used
   Canonical Correspondence Analysis and Generalized Linear Models to
   analyse the data.ResultsThere was a marked tendency for change in
   20years towards heterogeneous and poorly connected landscapes. This
   structural change appeared associated with trade-offs in ES, consisting
   of a loss of provisioning and regulating services inherent to
   agricultural and silvo-pastoral landscapes in favour of tourist-cultural
   and accommodation services, recently demanded by a growing urban
   population. The intensity of this change was favoured by urbanization
   processes, the proximity to the city, and restrictive protection
   measures linked to supramunicipal land management conservation
   plans.ConclusionsOur results question the effectiveness of long-term
   conservation measures taken in Spain to protect cultural landscapes. The
   innovative approach we use to analyse LS-ES coupling along urban-rural
   gradients provides a powerful tool for social-ecological land planning.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted at the apiary of the Beekeeping Research
   Section at the Sakha Agricultural Research Station, ARC, Kafrelsheikh,
   and other apiaries in Kafrelsheikh province, during two successive years
   2015 and 2016. The study aimed to survey nectar and pollen floral
   resources in Kafrelsheikh province. Ninty seven plant species belonging
   to 33 families were recorded as nectar sources, and 82 plant species
   belonging to 36 families were recorded as pollen sources during the
   whole year. The largest amount of monthly trapped pollen was obtained
   during May followed by August. It can be concluded that, beekeepers in
   Kafrelsheikh province can harvest good honey yield at the end of
   blooming seasons of citrus (Citrus spp.) during March and April,
   Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) during May and June, loofah
   (Luffa aegyptiaca Mill.) during June to October, cotton (Gossypium spp.)

Title = {{How Land Cover Spatial Resolution Affects Mapping of Urban Ecosystem
   Service Flows}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{In urban areas, estimating the effect of land cover (LC) data spatial
   resolution on ecosystem services (ES) mapping remains a challenge. In
   particular, mapping spatial flows of ES, from greenspaces to
   beneficiaries, may be more sensitive to LC data resolution than mapping
   potential supply or demand separately. Our objectives were to compare
   the sensitivity of global- and local-flow ES maps to LC data resolution,
   and to assess the effect of LC data resolution within different types of
   urban land uses. A case study was conducted in the city of Laval,
   Canada. Carbon storage (a global-flow ES), urban cooling and pollination
   (two local-flow ES) were mapped using LC data aggregated from 1 to 15 m.
   Results were analyzed for districts (comprising various types of urban
   land uses), and for 480 x 480 m residential and commercial zones.
   Greenspace cover was generally underestimated at coarser spatial
   resolutions; as a result, so were ES potential supply and flow. For
   urban cooling and pollination, the effect of LC data spatial resolution
   on ES flow also depended on changes in the spatial configuration of ES
   potential supply relative to ES demand. The magnitude of the effect
   differed among land use types. However, the effect was also highly
   variable between similar landscapes, suggesting that it is very
   sensitive to LC structure. To adequately map the ES provided by the
   small greenspaces scattered throughout the urban matrix, using land
   cover data with a spatial resolution of 5 m or finer is recommended,
   especially for local-flow ES.}},

Abstract = {{It is well-established that cities need nature for critical ecosystem
   services-from storing carbon, to reducing temperatures, to mitigating
   stormwater- and there is growing momentum to seek out strategies for how
   these services can intersect with urban design and planning efforts.
   Social scientists and conservation planners increasingly point to urban
   residents' need to breathe fresh air, encounter the natural world, and
   have room to play. It is less obvious, perhaps, whether nature needs
   cities in order to thrive. The evidence from both urban planning and
   conservation planning is increasingly ``yes.{''} As changes in land use
   and land cover sweep the planet, cities are becoming important refugia
   for certain wildlife populations. In recent years, urban planning has
   embraced the concept of ``green infrastructure{''} as a way to embed
   green space across metropolitan landscapes to draw on the inherent
   benefits nature provides to cities, as well as to create habitat for
   wildlife. We explore this evolving view of cities and nature in the
   fields of urban and conservation planning. We argue the time is ripe to
   bring these worlds together, and, using our empirical work, establish
   that cities matter for monarch butterflies, other pollinators, and
   at-risk wildlife species.}},

Abstract = {{For honey bees (Apis mellifera), colony maintenance and growth are
   highly dependent on worker foragers obtaining sufficient resources from
   flowering plants year round. Despite the importance of floral diversity
   for proper bee nutrition, urban development has drastically altered
   resource availability and diversity for these important pollinators.
   Therefore, understanding the floral resources foraged by bees in
   urbanized areas is key to identifying and promoting plants that enhance
   colony health in those environments. In this study, we identified the
   pollen foraged by bees in four developed areas of the U.S., and explored
   whether there were spatial or temporal differences in the types of
   floral sources of pollen used by honey bees in these landscapes. To do
   this, pollen was collected every month for up to one year from colonies
   located in developed (urban and suburban) sites in California, Texas,
   Florida, and Michigan, except during months of pollen dearth or winter.
   Homogenized pollen samples were acetolyzed and identified
   microscopically to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Once identified,
   each pollen type was classified into a frequency category based on its
   overall relative abundance. Species richness and diversity indices were
   also calculated and compared across states and seasons. We identified up
   to 64 pollen types belonging to 39 plant families in one season
   (California). Species richness was highest in CA and lowest in TX, and
   was highest during spring in every state. In particular,
   ``predominant{''} and ``secondary{''} pollen types belonged to the
   families Arecaceae, Sapindaceae, Anacardiaceae, Apiaceae, Asteraceae,
   Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Fagaceae, Lythraceae, Myrtaceae, Rhamnaceae,
   Rosaceae, Rutaceae, Saliaceae, and Ulmaceae. This study will help
   broaden our understanding of honey bee foraging ecology and nutrition in
   urban environments, and will help promote the use of plants that serve
   the dual purpose of providing aesthetic value and nutritious forage for
   honey bee colonies placed in developed landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization is one of the most significant land cover transformations,
   and while climate alteration is one of its most cited ecological
   consequences we have very limited knowledge on its effect on species'
   thermal responses. We investigated whether changes in environmental
   thermal variability caused by urbanization influence thermal tolerance
   in honey bees (Apis mellifera) in a semi-arid city in central Mexico.
   Ambient environmental temperature and honey bee thermal tolerance were
   compared in urban and rural sites. Ambient temperature variability
   decreased with urbanization due to significantly higher nighttime
   temperatures in urban compared to rural sites and not from differences
   in maximum daily temperatures. Honeybee thermal tolerance breadth
   {[}critical thermal maxima (CTmax)-critical thermal minima (CTmin)] was
   narrower for urban bees as a result of differences in cold tolerance,
   with urban individuals having significantly higher CTmin than rural
   individuals, and CTmax not differing among urban and rural individuals.
   Honey bee body size was not correlated to thermal tolerance, and body
   size did not differ between urban and rural individuals. We found that
   honey bees' cold tolerance is modified through acclimation. Our results
   show that differences in thermal variability along small spatial scales
   such as urban-rural gradients can influence species' thermal tolerance
   breadths.}},

Title = {{Geographic Biases in Bee Research Limits Understanding of Species
   Distribution and Response to Anthropogenic Disturbance}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Habitat loss and degradation due to agricultural intensification and
   urbanization are key threats facing wild pollinators, especially bees.
   However, data on the distribution and abundance of most of the world's
   20,000+ bee species is lacking, making it difficult to assess the
   effects of anthropogenic disturbance through time. Moreover, there are
   geographic biases in the study of bees creating gaps in our
   understanding of species distributions and regional patterns of
   diversity. Research efforts are often focused around cities or field
   stations associated with universities and other research institutions.
   In this perspectives paper, we provide examples of geographic bias in
   knowledge regarding bee species distributions using recently collected
   data from Michigan and Colorado, USA-two states with published species
   checklists. We illustrate how a limited sampling effort can advance
   knowledge about bee species distributions, yielding species occurrence
   records at local and regional scales. Given the implications of
   geographic biases, we recommend future research efforts focus on poorly
   sampled geographic regions, especially those affected by anthropogenic
   disturbance, in order to expand our understanding of human impacts on
   wild bee species. Sampling across a broader geographic area will provide
   critical information for taxonomy and predictive models of bee species
   distributions and diversity. We encourage researchers to plan future
   studies with consideration of strategies to avoid oversampling local bee
   populations, the taxonomic expertise required to identify specimens, and
   resources necessary to voucher specimens.}},

   Pathogen}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY}},

Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{685-690}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bee pollinators can be exposed to pathogens when foraging on
   flowers previously visited by infected individuals. Infectious cells may
   be deposited in floral nectar, providing a site for pathogens to
   interact with nectar secondary compounds prior to infecting bees. Some
   nectar secondary compounds can reduce pathogen counts in infected bumble
   bees, but we know less about how exposure to these compounds directly
   affects pathogens prior to being ingested by their host. We exposed the
   trypanosomatid gut pathogen, Crithidia bombi (Lipa \& Triggiani 1988)
   (Trypanosomatida:Trypanosomatidae), to six different compounds found in
   nectar (aucubin, catalpol, nicotine, thymol, anabasine, and citric acid)
   for 1-h prior to ingestion by Bombus impatiens (Cresson 1863)
   (Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers that were then reared for 1 wk on a
   control diet. All of these compounds except citric acid reduce pathogen
   levels when consumed in hosts after infection, and citric acid is a
   common preservative found in citrus fruits and some honeys. We found
   that both citric acid and aucubin reduced Crithidia cell counts compared
   with controls. However, catalpol, nicotine, thymol, and anabasine did
   not have significant effects on Crithidia levels. These results suggest
   that Crithidia exposure in some floral nectars may reduce cell
   viability, resulting in a lower risk to visiting pollinators, but this
   effect may not be widespread across all flowering species.}},

Abstract = {{Planting ornamental species can help to create pollinator-friendly
   habitats. In the present study the flowering phenology and floral reward
   (nectar and pollen) in two cultivars of Prunus serrulata ('Kanzan' and
   `Amanogawa') were evaluated in 2014-2015 in the city of Lublin
   (south-east Poland). On average, the onset of flowering of P. serrulata
   occurred in the first ten days of April ('Kanzan') or at the end of
   April ('Amanogawa'), and lasted 8-17 days. In each year of the study, P.
   serrulata `Kanzan' started flowering 11-18 days earlier than P.
   serrulata `Amanogawa'. The double flowers of P. serrulata `Kanzan'
   offered only tiny amounts of nectar and pollen. The total mass of sugars
   was 0.59 mg per flower and that of pollen 0.08 mg per flower. The
   semi-double flowers of P. serrulata `Amanogawa' produced 4.5 mg of
   sugars per flower and 0.17 mg of pollen per flower. The frequency of
   pollinator visits to flowers was low in P. serrulata `Amanogawa' and
   very low in P. serrulata `Kanzan'. Therefore, if pollinator-friendly
   arrangements are made in urban areas, these cultivars should not be
   planted.}},

Abstract = {{Organic production is a fast-growing sector of agriculture in need of
   variety evaluations under their unique production systems. This study
   evaluated 16 watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) varieties for their

   were grown on plastic mulch-covered beds on land that had been certified
   organic in accordance with the U.S. Department of Agriculture National
   Organic Program. Six of the entries were F-1 hybrids; the remaining
   entries were open-pollinated (OP) varieties. Of the 10 OP varieties,
   three were considered heirloom varieties, including Cream of
   Saskatchewan, Georgia Rattlesnake, and Moon \& Stars. `Georgia
   Rattlesnake' was the highest yielding variety and had the greatest
   average fruit weight. Along with `Georgia Rattlesnake', `Nunhems 800',
   `Nunhems 860', `Orangeglo', and `SSX 8585' were included in the top five
   yielding varieties. The top five yielding varieties had fruit size that
   averaged more than 20 lb. Fruit size correlated with rind thickness,
   with lighter fruit having thinner rind (Pearson's correlation, r =
   0.779), which is not unexpected. `Sangria' had the greatest average
   soluble solids content at 11.2\%, which was greater than all entries
   with soluble solids less than 10\%.}},

Abstract = {{Many Bumble bee (Bombus) species are in decline and conservation efforts
   must be undertaken now to lessen or reverse the trend. For effective
   efforts to occur, the first step must be an accurate assessment of
   extinction risk. Yet only four of over forty Canadian Bombus species
   have been assessed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife
   in Canada (COSEWIC), despite evidence of decline for numerous species in
   this genus. Here, we evaluated the status of the American Bumble bee,
   Bombus pensylvanicus De Geer 1773 in Canada. A challenge with species
   assessments is obtaining adequate occurrence data temporally and
   spatially. Citizen science is a field where volunteers can collect data
   similar to that of experts over a broader coverage than researchers
   could often cover alone. We used data from the Bumble Bee Watch citizen
   science program, a database of North American Bombus records
   representing field survey and collection records from the late-1800s,
   and our own field surveys to evaluate the status of B. pensylvanicus in
   Canada using the International Union for the Conservation of Nature
   (IUCN) Red List assessment criteria. We found that B. pensylvanicus'
   Area of Occurrence has decreased by about 70\%, its Extent of Occurrence
   by 37\%, and its relative abundance by 89\%, from 2007 to 2016 as
   compared to 1907-2006. These findings warrant an assessment of
   Critically Endangered using IUCN Red List criteria for B. pensylvanicus
   in Canada. Our findings will help inform management of B. pensylvanicus
   and exemplify the importance of citizen science programs for wildlife
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Habitat loss and alteration are widely considered one of the main
   drivers of current pollinator diversity loss. Yet little is known about
   habitat importance and preferences for major groups of pollinators,
   although this information is crucial to anticipate and mitigate the
   current decline of their populations. We aim to rank and assess the
   importance of different habitats for bees, to determine the preference
   for and avoidance of particular habitat types by different bees and to
   quantify the diversity of bees within and among habitats. Location
   North-eastern USA. Time period The sampling was done over 15 years
   (2001-2015). Major taxa studied Apoidea. Methods We used an
   unprecedented extensive dataset of >15,000 bee specimens, comprising
   more than 400 species collected across north-east USA. We extracted
   habitat information from the sample points and used network analyses,
   null models comparisons and beta-diversity analysis to assess habitat
   importance, habitat preference, use and diversity. Results We found that
   natural habitats sustain higher bee diversity and a different set of
   species than agricultural and urban areas. Although many bee species
   used human-altered habitats, most species exhibited strong preferences
   for forested habitats and only a few preferred altered habitats over
   more natural habitats. In contrast to previous studies, landscape
   composition only had moderate buffer effects on diversity loss. The loss
   of biodiversity in human-altered environments could have been higher but
   it was partially compensated by the presence of human commensals and
   exotic species. Main conclusions Although human-altered environments may
   harbour a substantial number of species, our work suggests that
   preserving natural areas is still essential to guarantee the
   conservation of bee biodiversity.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Growing interest in urban agriculture has increased demand for
   pollination services. Most studies map pollination supply broadly, and
   do not consider the impacts of fine-scale urban land-use practices on
   the dynamics of pollination delivery, leaving a critical gap in our
   understanding of the pollinator supply-demand balance in urban
   landscapes. This study demonstrates a spatially-explicit framework,
   using Iowa City, IA (USA) as the case study region, for assessing the
   capacity of urban ecosystems to produce pollinator services in support
   of demand from urban agriculture. We estimate pollinator supply using
   the InVEST pollination model with detailed land-cover data produced
   through field survey and Bayesian hierarchical analysis, and we validate
   modeling results with bee abundance and richness data. We map social
   demand for pollinators using a kernel density estimation of urban
   agricultural sites and evaluate supply-demand budgets through spatial
   overlay analysis. Our results show that incorporating
   high-thematic-resolution urban land-use data substantially improves the
   performance of pollination supply modeling. Pollinator supply meets
   demand in 72\% of the city. Surpluses occur in natural areas and
   heavily-vegetated, established residential neighborhoods, whereas
   deficits occur in resource-poor lawns. Our mapping framework stresses
   the key role of humans in modifying resource availability and pollinator
   services, and demonstrates the effectiveness of using disaggregated
   socio-economic data in urban land-cover classification for predicting
   pollinator supply. Our improved ability to identify spatial congruence
   and disparities in urban pollinator supply and demand can be used to
   inform pollinator conservation to support sustainable urban agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Bombus impatiens, the common eastern bumble bee, is the first bumble bee
   established outside of its native range in North America. Native to the
   eastern portion of the continent, the species was imported to British
   Columbia in the early 2000s for greenhouse pollination and subsequently
   became established in the wild. Here we report on the continuing
   expansion of its range in the Pacific Northwest, including the detection
   of gynes and workers in Washington State. Sightings of B. impatiens in
   the region have become increasingly common based on various Internet
   mapping and reporting sites. The species has been observed about 30km
   south of the British Columbia border, or 60km from the first British
   Columbia detections. Species distribution models indicate that the Puget
   Sound and Willamette Valley are suitable habitat, and the bee will
   likely continue to expand its range southward towards California. The
   potential impacts of B. impatiens in the region are unknown and will be
   monitored in future research.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization decreases the abundance of native species, which may enable
   exotics to experience enemy release in urban areas, enhancing their
   invasive capacity. The invasive autogamous orchid, Spathoglottis
   plicata, acquires some biotic resistance in Puerto Rico from a native
   orchid weevil specialist, Stethobaris polita. The distribution of S.
   polita along an urbanization gradient may affect the distribution of S.
   plicata and its future spread. To determine the effect of land cover on
   both species and the impact of S. polita on the spread of S. plicata, we
   modeled the distribution of the interaction between the two species and
   additionally assessed weevil abundance and the damage they do in
   different land cover types and localities. Land cover was the most
   important predictor of distribution for both species. S. plicata occurs
   in forests, pastures, and urban areas; however, S. polita is largely
   absent from urban areas, including urban forests, and along rivers
   within wet forests. This distribution likely reflects the dispersal
   ability of S. plicata, in addition to potential human intervention, and
   the inability of S. polita to penetrate or become established within the
   urban matrix. Thus, within the invasive range of S. plicata in Puerto
   Rico, geographical heterogeneity in acquired interactions is expected to
   result in higher seed production within areas of enemy release. The
   orchid is likely to spread more rapidly in urban forests, as well as
   along forest rivers, where S. polita is sparse.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{191}},

Abstract = {{sThe Ailanthus altissima pollen (AAP) has been reported as an emerging
   aeroallergen worldwide. This paper aims at examining the allergen
   pattern and the elemental composition of A. altissima pollen collected
   during two consecutive seasons (2014 and 2015). A gel-based allergomic
   study and SEM coupled to energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis have
   been carried out in order to evaluate the allergenic and elemental
   composition of AAP in two consecutive years. The IgE reactive patterns
   of 2014 and 2015 AAP PBS extracts were compared using the serum of a
   31-year-old woman suffering from severe pollinosis symptoms to AAP. The
   EDX analysis revealed an important year-to-year variation in the ratios
   of some polluting elements such as nickel, sulfur, aluminum, lead, and
   copper. Gel alignments and comparative immunoproteomic analyses showed
   differential protein expression and IgE reactive patterns between AAPs
   collected in 2014 and 2015 pollinating seasons. From 20 distinct
   IgE-reactive spots detected in AAP extracts, 13 proteins showed higher
   expression in 2014 sample, while 7 allergen candidates exhibited an
   increased expression in AAP collected in 2015. Matrix-assisted laser
   desorption ionization-MS/MS analyses led to the identification of 13
   IgE-binding proteins with confidence, all belonging to well-known
   allergenic protein families, i.e., enolase, calreticulin, and pectate
   lyase. Overall, the 2014 AAP showed higher concentrations of urban
   polluting elements as well as an increased expression of allergenic
   pectate lyase isoforms of about 52kDa. This study demonstrates that the
   implementation of allergomic tools for the safety assessment of newly
   introduced and invasive plant species would help to the comprehensive
   monitoring of proteomic and transcriptomic alterations involving
   environmental allergens.}},

Abstract = {{Steep declines in North American monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus)
   populations have prompted continent-wide conservation efforts. While
   monarch monitoring efforts have existed for years, we lack a
   comprehensive approach to monitoring population vital rates integrated
   with habitat quality to inform adaptive management and effective
   conservation strategies. Building a geographically and ecologically
   representative dataset of monarchs and their habitat will improve these
   efforts. These data will help track long-term changes in the
   distribution and abundance of monarchs and their habitats, refine
   population and habitat models, and illuminate how conservation
   activities affect monarchs and their habitats. The Monarch Conservation
   Science Partnership developed the Integrated Monarch Monitoring Program
   (IMMP) to profile breeding habitats and their use by monarchs in North
   America. A spatially balanced random sampling framework guides site
   selection, while also allowing opportunistic inclusion of sites chosen
   by participants, such as conservation areas. The IMMP weaves new
   protocols together with those from existing monitoring programs to
   improve data compatibility for assessing milkweed (Asclepias spp.)
   density, nectar resources, monarch reproduction and survival, and adult
   monarch habitat use. Participants may select a protocol subset according
   to interests or local monitoring objectives, thereby maximizing
   contributions. Conservation partners, including public and private land
   managers, academic researchers, and citizen scientists contribute data
   to a national dataset available for analyses at multiple scales. We
   describe the program and its development, implementation elements that
   make the program robust and feasible, participation to date, and how
   IMMP data can advance research and conservation for monarchs,
   pollinators, and their habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The insecticide fipronil is under regulatory scrutiny worldwide for its
   toxicity to pollinators and aquatic invertebrates. We conducted the
   first U.S. nationwide, longitudinal study of sewage sludges for
   fiproles, i.e., the sum of fipronil and its major degradates (fipronil
   sulfone, sulfide, amide, and desulfinyl). Archived sludges (n = 109)
   collected in three campaigns over 15 years were analyzed by isotope
   dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, revealing
   ubiquitous fiprole occurrence (0.2-385.3 mu g/kg) since 2001 and a
   significant increase (2.4 +/- 0.3 fold; p <0.005) both from 2001 to
   2006/7 and from 2001 to 2015/6, but not a significant increase from
   2006/7 to 2015/6 (p = 0.275). A geospatial analysis showed fiprole
   levels in municipal sludges to be uncoupled from agricultural use of
   fipronil on cropland surrounding sampled municipalities, thus pointing
   to non-agricultural uses (i.e., spot-on treatment and urban pest
   control) as a major source of fiprole loading to wastewater. Whereas
   anaerobic digestion was correlated with increases in fipronil sulfide at
   the expense of parental fipronil (p < 0.001), total fiprole levels in
   sewage sludges were similar regardless of the solids treatment approach
   applied (p = 0.519). Treatment plant effluent available from 12
   facilities in 2015/6 contained fiproles at 0.3-112.9 ng/L, exceeding the
   United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) aquatic
   invertebrate life benchmark for chronic fipronil exposure (11 ng/L) in
   67\% of cases. Whereas the USEPA identified fipronil in sludge only
   recently (2015), retrospective analyses and modeling conducted here show
   contaminant ubiquity and nationwide increases of fiprole mass (compared
   to 2001 levels) in U.S. municipal sludge (1140 +/- 230 kg in 2015/6),
   and treated effluent nationwide (1970 390 kg in 2015/6) over the past 15
   years. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Ecological filtering in scrub fragments restructures the taxonomic and
   functional composition of native bee assemblages}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Predicting the long-term consequences of habitat alteration for the
   preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function requires an
   understanding of how ecological filters drive taxonomic and functional
   biodiversity loss. Here, we test a set of predictions concerning the
   role of ecological filters in restructuring native bee assemblages
   inhabiting fragmented coastal sage scrub ecosystems in southern
   California, USA. In 2011 and 2012, we collected native bees in scrub
   habitat belonging to two treatment categories: large natural reserves
   and small habitat fragments embedded in an urban landscape. We compared
   bee assemblages in reserve and fragment sites with respect to their
   taxonomic and functional alpha diversity, beta diversity, assemblage
   composition, and mean geographical range size estimated via distribution
   maps compiled for this study from digitized specimen records. We found
   multiple lines of evidence that ecological filtering drove bee diversity
   loss in fragments: a disproportionate loss of functional diversity
   relative to taxonomic diversity, shifts in assemblage composition driven
   largely by the preferential extirpation of reserve-associated indicator
   species, and disproportionate loss of range-restricted species. However,
   we found no evidence of taxonomic or functional homogenization across
   fragment bee assemblages, suggesting that filtering was not sufficiently
   strong to cause a subset of functional traits (and their associated
   species) to dominate assemblages in fragments. Our results suggest that
   ecological filtering altered bee assemblages in habitat fragments, even
   when such fragments contained well-preserved native plant assemblages,
   underscoring the importance of preserving large areas of natural habitat
   for the conservation of bees (especially range-restricted taxa) and
   their associated ecological functions.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{ContextThe response of rare species to human land use is poorly known
   because rarity is difficult to study; however, it is also important
   because rare species compose most of biodiversity, and are
   disproportionately vulnerable. Regional bee pollinator faunas have not
   been assessed for rarity outside of Europe. Therefore, we do not know to
   what extent anthropogenic landscapes support rare North American bee
   biodiversity.ObjectivesWe ask how richness and abundance of bee species
   respond to land use, within quartiles of species defined by their
   numerical, phenological, and geographical rarity.MethodsWe conducted a
   field study to sample bee communities in forested, agricultural, and
   urban landscapes replicated across a large spatial extent of the
   northeastern United States. We used large independent data sets to
   classify observed bee species according to three forms of rarity: their
   numerical rarity (low regional frequency in a museum-based data set),
   phenological rarity (short flight season length) and geographical rarity
   (small range size).ResultsFor all three forms of rarity, we found half
   as many rare bee species in agricultural landscapes compared to forest.
   We found half as many phenologically rare species in urban landscapes.
   Bees that had both shorter flight seasons and smaller range sizes were
   between one-third and one-half as rich in both types of anthropogenic
   landscapes, regardless of regional frequency.ConclusionsAlthough a
   minority of rare bee species were found in anthropogenic landscapes, our
   overall conclusion is that the native vegetation of our region, forest,
   is critical for supporting rare bee biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{The Mojave Desert of the southwestern U.S. is home to two protected
   species of poppy in the genus Arctomecon Torr. \& Frem. (Papaveraceae).
   A pollinator of these species is the specialist bee Perdita meconis
   Griswold (Andrenidae) a specialist on poppy pollen. Recently, the
   easternmost population of P.meconis, which was associated with A.humilis
   Coville in Utah, has become locally extinct, and other historically
   associated bee pollinators have become scarce. Implicated in the
   disruption of this pollination system is invasion by the Africanised
   honey bee. Here we report on the status of P.meconis in historic
   populations associated with congener A.californica Torr. \& Frem., 100km
   west in Clark Co., Nevada where the Africanised honey bee is also
   adventive. We surveyed flower visitors at eight A.californica
   populations in 2017, six of which had been surveyed in 1995. In general,
   we found no disruptions of the historic pollination system of
   A.californica despite the presence of abundant Africanised honey bees,
   which largely foraged at other flower species. The most likely cause of
   the disparate effects of the Africanised honey bee in Utah and Nevada is
   livestock grazing. Grazing in Utah has been continuous for over three
   decades and while cattle do not graze A.humilis, they graze its floral
   competitors, forcing honey bees to forage on poppy flowers. In Nevada,
   protections afforded to the desert tortoise halted grazing approximately
   when the Africanised honey bee invaded, making diverse floral forage
   available for honey bees.}},

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{Lawns represent one of the largest cultivated areas in urban landscapes,
   and in the Upper Midwest of the United States, lawns are typically
   composed of a small number of cool-season turfgrass species. There is
   increased interest in enhancing areas dedicated to lawns using flowering
   species for conservation purposes-for example, to support pollinators.
   In this study we used a model flowering forb, Kura clover (Trifolium
   ambiguum M. Bieb.), because-like many flowering species of conservation
   interest-it is slow to establish and is sensitive to grass competition.
   We varied the Kura clover seeding rate into four different turfgrass
   species treatments: kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), hard fescue
   (Festuca brevipila Tracy), tall fescue {[}Schedonorus arundinaceum
   (Schreb.) Darbysh.], and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) in two
   separate trials. Establishment and bloom of Kura clover was
   significantly greater in trial 1 for kentucky bluegrass and hard fescue
   than tall fescue and perennial ryegrass. In trial 2, Kura clover
   established significantly greater in kentucky bluegrass compared with
   tall fescue and perennial ryegrass, whereas Kura establishment in hard
   fescue was not significantly different from the other treatments. The
   seeding rate of Kura clover did not affect establishment in either
   trial. The results from this study suggest kentucky bluegrass and hard
   fescue are promising turf companion grasses for future forb/turf
   interseeding research.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation affects landscape connectivity, the extent of
   which is influenced by the movement capacity of the vectors of seed and
   pollen dispersal for plants. Negative impacts of reduced connectivity
   can include reduced fecundity, increased inbreeding, genetic erosion and
   decreased long-term viability. These are issues for not only old
   (remnant) populations, but also new (restored) populations. We assessed
   reproductive and connective functionality within and among remnant and
   restored populations of a common tree, Banksia menziesii R.Br.
   (Proteaceae), in a fragmented urban landscape, utilising a genetic and
   graph theoretical approach. Adult trees and seed cohorts from five
   remnants and two restored populations were genotyped using
   microsatellite markers. Genetic variation and pollen dispersal were
   assessed using direct (paternity assignment) and indirect (pollination
   graphs and mating system characterisation) methods. Restored populations
   had greater allelic diversity (Ar=8.08; 8.34) than remnant populations
   (Ar range=6.49-7.41). Genetic differentiation was greater between
   restored and adjacent remnants (F-ST=0.03 and 0.10) than all other
   pairwise comparisons of remnant populations (mean F-ST=0.01 +/- 0.01;
   n=16 P=0.001). All populations displayed low correlated paternity
   (r(p)=0.06-0.16) with wide-ranging realised pollen dispersal distances
   (<1.7km) and well-connected pollen networks. Here, we demonstrate
   reproductive and connective functionality of old and new populations of
   B. menziesii within a fragmented landscape. Due to long-distance
   pollination events, the physical size of these sites underestimates
   their effective population size. Thus, they are functionally equivalent
   to large populations, integrated into a larger landscape matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Human activities have drastically altered natural ecosystems, mostly by
   converting forests into agricultural and urban areas. Brazilwood
   (Paubrasilia echinata) is an endangered tree endemic to the Brazilian
   Atlantic forest originally occurring along the whole coast. The species
   is largely planted in urban areas due to its ornamental potential. In
   this paper, we compared the phenology, floral traits and the
   reproductive success of P. echinata between urban and natural
   ecosystems. We have hypothesized that individuals in urban ecosystem
   will have: i) reproductive phenophases lasting longer than in natural,
   ii) lower number of pollen grains and ovules per flower, iii) lower
   richness and frequency of flower visitors, and iv) lower natural fruit
   and seed set. The study was carried out in urban green spaces of the
   city of Recife and in an Atlantic forest remnant, both in Pernambuco
   State, northeastern Brazil. The species flowered and fruited practically
   all year round in the urban ecosystem, contrasting with the annual
   pattern of flowering and fruiting observed in the natural area. We
   documented that brazilwood trees in urban areas had smaller
   inflorescences, fewer flowers/inflorescences, larger flowers, less
   pollen/flower, lower richness of floral visitors and lower fruit and
   seed set when compared to natural ecosystem. Also, when considering the
   most frequent effective pollinator, the invasive bee Apis mellifera
   predominated in urban, whereas the autochthonous pollinator Centris
   aenea prevailed in natural. Moreover, C. aenea acted as occasional
   pollinator in urban area because the flowers of P. echinata are larger
   in this ecosystem. Independent of the underlying mechanism, the
   brazilwood had an impoverished richness of native pollinators and a
   significant reduction in the reproductive success in urban ecosystem,
   indicating an impairment in the pollination process. The viability of
   planting trees in tropical urban areas as an ex-situ conservation
   alternative for species obligatory dependent on cross-pollination, such
   as P. echinata, may be compromised.}},

Abstract = {{Green spaces are important refuges for biodiversity in urban areas, and
   lawns are one of the most widespread elements of urban green spaces
   globally. Chinese cities have adopted the use of lawns relatively lately
   and are currently experiencing a rapid increase in lawn area. In order
   to obtain knowledge and develop recommendations related to planning,
   design, and management of lawns in public parks, this study compared
   lawns with other three types of herbaceous vegetation in terms of plant
   and pollinator diversity and composition, using Xi'an City as a case
   study. Plants and pollinators were inventoried in 72 lawns, 12 perennial
   meadows, 15 Ophiopogon japonicas groundcovers, and eight Oxalis
   corymbosa groundcovers. Plant species diversity in lawns was positively
   associated with proportion of green space around lawns and lawn age, and
   negatively associated with frequency of use of chemical fertilizers.
   Proportion of native plant species in lawns was negatively associated
   with use frequency of chemical fertilizers and mowing frequency, and
   positively associated with irrigation frequency and lawn size.
   Pollinator species diversity is positively related to flowering plant
   species richness in all vegetation types. In order to enhance plant and
   pollinator species diversity, less mowing and chemical use on lawns are
   recommended. Future urban planning should also consider preserving and
   increasing the green area coverage within the city. Based on abundance
   and attractiveness to pollinators, several native herbaceous plant
   species have potential when creating alternative green spaces to lawns,
   but more studies are required to test their performance.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale honey bee colony loss threatens pollination services
   throughout the United States. An increase in anthropogenic pressure may
   influence the exposure of hives to household and agricultural
   pesticides. The objective of this survey was to provide an assessment of
   the risk of exposure to commonly used pesticides to honey bee colonies
   in Virginia in relation to land use. Adult honey bee, pollen, and wax
   samples from colonies throughout Virginia were evaluated for pyrethroid,
   organophosphate, organochlorine, and triazine pesticides using gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Of the 11 pesticides
   analyzed, nine were detected in one or more hive matrices. The
   probability of detecting a pesticide in pollen was less in forests than
   in pasture, agriculture, or urban landscapes. Coumaphos and fluvalinate
   were significantly more likely to be detected across all matrices with
   concentrations in wax as high as 15500 and 6970 ng/g (dry weight),
   respectively, indicating the need for further research on the potential
   effects of miticide accumulation in wax to larval and adult bees. (C)

   characteristics of `Clementine' mandarin using microscopic and molecular
   approaches}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{249}},

Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{`Clementine' is one of the most important cultivars of mandarin that
   always has problems with fertilization and fruit set because of its
   self-incompatibility. Therefore, for the commercial fruit production,
   suitable and compatible pollen is required. To determine the best pollen
   source, `Clementine' flowers were subjected to the different pollen
   grains including sweet lemon, Lisbon lemon, grapefruit, sour orange, as
   well as self-pollination and open pollination. Compatibility and
   incompatibility tests were carried out using controlled pollination
   method and microscopic study of pollen tube growth. Molecular markers
   were used to study the genetic relationships of the species and assess
   the role of genetic similarity on the fruits set and their attributes.
   The results of the microscopic study indicated that `Clementine'
   mandarin is a self-incompatible cultivar but it is compatible with all
   the cultivars used in the experiment. Clementine fruit characteristics
   significantly influenced by pollen grain sources. The results of
   controlled pollination showed that the highest percentage of fruit set
   was obtained from flowers pollinated with sweet lemon pollen (73.75\%)
   followed by Lisbon lemon pollen (69.25\%) while the lowest fruit set was
   obtained from the self-pollinated flowers (11.75\%). The highest and the
   lowest hale seeds were obtained from the flowers pollinated by Lisbon
   lemon pollen (12.22\%) and self-pollinated ones (no viable seed),
   respectively. High correlation was observed between some of the studied
   characters that would be useful for selection purposes in the breeding
   programs. Results of microscopic evaluation of pollen grain tubes
   revealed that among the studied pollen grains, sour orange pollens were
   the most successful for penetration to the basal portion of style and
   into ovary of `Clementine' mandarin. Assessment of genetic relationship
   among different Citrus species revealed that sour orange was the most
   similar species with `Clementine' mandarin. High positive correlation
   was observed between genetic similarities of pollen sources at DNA level
   with the pollen grain sprouting and penetration to the different parts
   of style and ovary as well as seed formation percentages. Based on the
   studied fruit characteristics, grapefruit and Lisbon lemon pollens are
   suggested as the suitable pollinators for improving the qualitative and
   quantitative characteristics of `Clementine' mandarin fruit.}},

Title = {{Urbanisation modulates plant-pollinator interactions in invasive vs.
   native plant species}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 23}},
Abstract = {{Pollination is a key ecological process, and invasive alien plant
   species have been shown to significantly affect plant-pollinator
   interactions. Yet, the role of the environmental context in modulating
   such processes is understudied. As urbanisation is a major component of
   global change, being associated with a range of stressors (e.g. heat,
   pollution, habitat isolation), we tested whether the attractiveness of a
   common invasive alien plant (Robinia pseudoacacia, black locust) vs. a
   common native plant (Cytisus scoparius, common broom) for pollinators
   changes with increasing urbanisation. We exposed blossoms of both
   species along an urbanisation gradient and quantified different types of
   pollinator interaction with the flowers. Both species attracted a broad
   range of pollinators, with significantly more visits for R.
   pseudoacacia, but without significant differences in numbers of insects
   that immediately accessed the flowers. However, compared to native
   Cytisus, more pollinators only hovered in front of flowers of invasive
   Robinia without visiting those subsequently. The decision rate to enter
   flowers of the invasive species decreased with increasing urbanisation.
   This suggests that while invasive Robinia still attracts many
   pollinators in urban settings attractiveness may decrease with
   increasing urban stressors. Results indicated future directions to
   deconstruct the role of different stressors in modulating
   plant-pollinator interactions, and they have implications for urban
   development since Robinia can be still considered as a
   ``pollinator-friendly{''} tree for certain urban settings.}},

Title = {{Tracking neonicotinoids following their use as cotton seed treatments}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Neonicotinoids are a leading class of insecticides on the global market,
   accounting for nearly 25\%. They are widely used in both agricultural
   and residential settings. Causing neuron failure by irreversibly binding
   to the insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, neonicotinoids offer
   broad spectrum efficacy against a variety of pests. However, because
   they are non-selective with regard to insect species, there has been
   some concern with neonicotinoid use over threats to pollinators such as
   honeybees, and potential indirect effects to migratory waterfowl as a
   result of invertebrate prey population depletion. In order to study
   occurrence and fate of neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam and imidacloprid),
   we analyzed cotton leaves on plants grown from neonicotinoid-treated
   seeds and corresponding soil samples between cotton rows. Neonicotinoid
   concentration data from cotton leaves appears to be consistent with the
   claim that seed treatments protect plants for 3-4 weeks; by 30 days
   post-planting, neonicotinoid concentrations fell, in general, to 200
   ng/g or lower. This represents about a 10-fold decrease from plant
   concentrations at approximately 2 weeks post-planting. It was found that
   neonicotinoids used as seed treatments remained present in the soil for
   months post planting and could be available for runoff. To that end, 21
   playa wetlands were sampled; 10 had at least one quantifiable
   neonicotinoid present, three of which were classified as grassland or
   rangeland playas, two were urban, and the remaining five were cropland
   playas. In several instances, neonicotinoid concentrations in playas
   exceeded EPA chronic benchmarks for aquatic invertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Borders are back with a vengeance. From the Americas to the
   Mediterranean, borders cut through the increasingly integrated world in
   a way that exposes the inside-outside logic of contemporary capitalism.
   All this happens on a backdrop where cities are becoming the key sites
   of contestation since borders and levees do not suffice to keep them
   intact. Cities are also increasingly becoming the focus of international
   efforts to deal with climate change and migration, where nation-states
   are falling short. By synthesizing the possibilities of urban belonging
   and right-to-the-world, we argue that new urban imaginaries are at the
   frontline of the mobilities debate today. Consequently, we argue for a
   cross-pollination of mobility justice and climate justice as urban
   citizenship. The main thrust of our argument is that there are viable
   alternatives to the isolationist fortress nation model, which can bring
   a new dimension to debates concerning climate change and migration.
   Fearless cities are but one example of these emerging alternatives. By
   focusing on the opportunities for a radical response to climate change
   and migration, we suggest that cities can respond to the burning
   mobility challenges of our times with a just, grounded and egalitarian
   urban citizenship framed as mobile commons.}},

Abstract = {{Auckland, a city with a population of approximately 1.7 million, is
   located directly on the Auckland Volcanic Field, a late Quaternary-era
   monogenetic field. There are at least 53 volcanoes across the field,
   many of which are of geological, cultural and ecological significance,
   such as for being reserves for native species; however, few assessments
   of the richness of avian biodiversity across the volcanoes have been
   made. To address this data shortfall, we conducted avian biodiversity
   surveys using stationary point counts within nine of Auckland's volcanic
   cone reserves. Thirty-eight species were detected across the sites, of
   which 18 were native. Our estimates of relative species abundances and
   detection probabilities revealed that the most common native birds
   within these reserves were silvereyes, tui and southern black-backed
   gulls, while common mynas, house sparrows, Eurasian blackbirds and
   eastern rosellas were the most common introduced species. In addition to
   tui and silvereyes, the presence of other natives critical to the
   functioning of native ecosystems, such as New Zealand fantails, grey
   warblers and New Zealand pigeon, suggest that the volcanoes possess a
   diverse native avifauna supported by native flora that warrant continued
   and intensified restoration efforts. We discuss several feasible
   strategies for improving faunal and floral biodiversity across the
   volcanic cone reserves. Continued avian biodiversity surveys are also of
   critical importance as they will enable us to further evaluate and
   prioritise restoration projects within Auckland's multitude of diverse
   volcanic cone reserves.}},

Journal = {{DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{73-92}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The observation of daily life practices in peasant and indigenous
   communities of the Chilean temperate forest reveals the established
   intimacy with other species; an intimacy that has allowed the
   regeneration of plant cover in an area deeply damaged by timber activity
   in the 20th century. Such intimacy finds its sustenance in the knowledge
   that results from the affections incubated toward the territory, as
   revealed by beekeeping. The case of bees is of particular interest
   because of the stimulus they represent both for the development of
   personal reforestation initiatives and for the possibility they offer to
   reinvent small-scale ways of life. It is in their relationship with them
   that both the traditional patterns of interspecies linkage and the
   threats posed by market expansion come into play, particularly about the
   linkage of the pollinating activity of the bee offered as a service to
   the company. The knowledge and affects generated by beekeeping
   contradict the scientific knowledge conveyed to communities by the
   institutions of development. The meeting of both forms of knowledge
   raises contradictions and misunderstandings that suggest the convenience
   of constituting local practices in a model of substantive environmental
   citizenship. The symbiotic modes prevalent in the community ensure
   autonomous ways of inhabiting the territories, forms that are stressed
   when production intensifies in the interests of business opportunities.
   The promotion and protection of beekeeping activity should constitute a
   form of recognition that the State makes to those who exercise the care
   of forests, and its center should not be the business unit but the
   strengthening of social relationships and local autonomies.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal migration of huge numbers of hoverflies is frequently
   reported in Europe from mountain passes or spurs of land. The movement
   of such large numbers of beneficial insects is thought to provide
   significant ecosystem services in terms of pollination and pest control.
   Observations from the East Coast of the USA during the 1920s indicate
   the presence of migratory life histories among some hoverfly species
   there, but 90 years have now passed since the last reported observation
   of hoverfly migration in the USA. Here, we analyse video footage taken
   during a huge northward migration of hoverflies on 20 April 2017 on the
   West Coast of California. The quantification of migrant numbers from
   this footage allows us to estimate the passage of over 100 000
   hoverflies in half an hour over a 200 m section of headland in Montana
   de Oro State Park (San Luis Obispo County). Field collections and
   analysis of citizen science data indicate different species from the
   previously reported Eristalis tenax migrations on the East Coast of the
   USA and provide evidence for migration among North American hoverflies.
   We wish to raise awareness of this phenomenon and suggest approaches to
   advance the study of hoverfly migration in North America and elsewhere.}},

Title = {{Secondary metabolites from nectar and pollen: a resource for ecological
   and evolutionary studies}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Floral chemistry mediates plant interactions with herbivores, pathogens,
   and pollinators. The chemistry of floral nectar and pollen, the primary
   food rewards for pollinators, can affect both plant reproduction and
   pollinator health. Although the existence and functional significance of
   nectar and pollen secondary metabolites has long been known,
   comprehensive quantitative characterizations of secondary chemistry
   exist for only a few species. Moreover, little is known about
   intraspecific variation in nectar and pollen chemical profiles. Because
   the ecological effects of secondary chemicals are dose-dependent,
   heterogeneity across genotypes and populations could influence floral
   trait evolution and pollinator foraging ecology. To better understand
   within- and across-species heterogeneity in nectar and pollen secondary
   chemistry, we undertook exhaustive LC-MS and LC-UV-based chemical
   characterizations of nectar and pollen methanol extracts from 31
   cultivated and wild plant species. Nectar and pollen were collected from
   farms and natural areas in Massachusetts, Vermont, and California, USA,
   in 2013 and 2014. For wild species, we aimed to collect 10 samples from
   each of three sites. For agricultural and horticultural species, we
   aimed for 10 samples from each of three cultivars. Our data set (1,535
   samples, 102 identified compounds) identifies and quantifies each
   compound recorded in methanolic extracts, and includes chemical metadata
   that describe the molecular mass, retention time, and chemical
   classification of each compound. A reference phylogeny is included for
   comparative analyses. We found that each species possessed a distinct
   chemical profile; moreover, within species, few compounds were found in
   both nectar and pollen. The most common secondary chemical classes were
   flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids and amines, and chlorogenic acids. The
   most common compounds were quercetin and kaempferol glycosides. Pollens
   contained high concentrations of hydroxycinnamoyl-spermidine conjugates,
   mainly triscoumaroyl and trisferuloyl spermidine, found in 71\% of
   species. When present, pollen alkaloids and spermidines had median
   nonzero concentrations of 23,000mol/L (median 52\% of recorded
   micromolar composition). Although secondary chemistry was qualitatively
   consistent within each species and sample type, we found significant
   quantitative heterogeneity across cultivars and sites. These data
   provide a standard reference for future ecological and evolutionary
   research on nectar and pollen secondary chemistry, including its role in
   pollinator health and plant reproduction. Data are published under a

   conservation is of fundamental importance to conservation and to food
   production. Understanding of the extent of pollinator declines is
   constrained by the paucity of accessible data, which leads to
   geographically- and taxonomically-biased assessments. In addition, land
   conversion to agriculture and intensive agricultural management are two
   of the main threats to pollinators. This is paradoxical, as crop
   production depends on pollinators to maximize productivity. There is a
   need to reconcile conservation and ecosystem service provision in
   agroecosystems. These challenges require coordinated transdisciplinary
   research infrastructures. Specifically, we need better research
   infrastructures to (i) describe pollinator decline patterns worldwide,
   (ii) monitor current pollinator trends, and (iii) understand how to
   enhance pollinator numbers and pollination in agroecosystems. This can
   be achieved, first, by redoubling the efforts to make historical data on
   species occurrences, interactions and traits openly available and easy
   to integrate across databases. Second, by empowering citizen science to
   monitor key pollinator species in a coordinated way and standardizing,
   consolidating and integrating long term collection protocols both in
   natural and agricultural areas. Finally, there is a need to develop
   multi-actor, localised research infrastructures allowing integration of
   social, economic and ecological approaches in agriculture. We illustrate
   how decentralized infrastructures can accelerate the process of
   co-producing research and integrating data collection across scientists,
   managers, members of the public, farmers and disciplines. The time is
   ripe to harness the power of coordinated research infrastructures to
   understand and mitigate pollinator declines.}},

Abstract = {{Gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) is an important factor affecting
   fruit development and is one of the important mechanisms of seedlessness
   in citrus. Although many studies have investigated the mechanisms of SI,
   this process remains unclear in Xiangshui lemon (C. limon). In this
   study, we cloned one S-RNase homologous gene and one SLF homologous gene
   from the Xiangshui lemon, designated as ClS1 (pistil-specific
   expression) and ClF-box (pollen-specific expression), which contain open
   reading frames (ORFs) of 534 and 810bp, respectively. The expression
   pattern of these two genes was analyzed by quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction, and the results showed that the expression
   pattern of these two genes was significantly upregulated after
   self-pollination compared to that after cross-pollination. Through
   pollination in transgenic tobacco, we found that the pollen tubes grew
   slowly and became twisted after cross-pollination of ClS1f and ClF-box o
   transgenic tobaccos, but the pollen tubes of control, self-pollination
   ClS1 and cross-pollination ClS1o, and ClF-box f grew normally.
   Furthermore, significantly fewer pollen tubes of ClS1f and ClF-box o
   entered the ovules than that in other combinations, and the seed number
   of cross-pollination ClS1f and ClF-box o transgenic tobaccos was
   significantly reduced. These results indicated that the ClS1 and ClF-box
   genes contribute to the self-incompatibility of the Xiangshui lemon.}},

Abstract = {{Cypress (Cupressus sp.pl) is a genus within the Cupressaceae family.
   This family covers all of the Earth's continents except for Antarctica,
   and it includes about 160 species. The most important taxa for allergic
   diseases belong to five different genera: Cupressus, Hesperocyparis,
   Juniperus, Cryptomeria, and Chamaecyparis. Cupressaceae species share a
   common pollen type that can even include the genus Taxus (Taxaceae) when
   this plant is also present. As Juniperus oxycedrus pollinates in
   October, Cupressus sempervirens in January and February, Hesperocyparis
   arizonica (prev. Cupressus arizonica) in February and March, and
   Juniperus communis in April, the symptomatic period is long-lasting. Due
   to global warming, the pollination period tends to last longer, and
   there is a trend for Cupressaceae bioclimate niches to migrate north. In
   Mediterranean areas, C. sempervirens (Italian cypress or Mediterranean
   cypress) is by far the most common pollinating species. It accounts for
   half of the total pollination level. The group 1 major allergens belong
   to the pectate-lyase family, and members share 70 to 97\% sequence
   homology within the different Cupressaceae. Group 2 allergens correspond
   to the polygalacturonase protein family, while group 3, a minor
   allergen, belongs to the family of thaumatin-like proteins, a
   pathogenesis-related protein 5. Group 4 allergens are Ca++-binding
   protein (4 EF-hands). Aside from these four groups, about 15 other
   allergens have been reported. Prominent among these is a basic
   low-molecular mass cross-reactive allergen that was identified recently,
   and which is suspected to be involved in pollen food syndromes which are
   common with peach and citrus. The prevalence of cypress allergy in the
   general population ranges from 0.6 to 3\%, depending on the degree of
   exposure to the pollen. Depending on the geographic area and the studied
   population, 9 to 65\% of outpatients consulting an allergist may have
   sensitization to cypress pollen. Repeated cross-sectional studies
   performed at different time intervals have demonstrated a threefold
   increase in the percentage of cypress allergy around the Mediterranean
   area. Risk factors include a genetic predisposition and/or a strong
   exposure to pollen, and the natural history of cypress allergy allows
   identification of a subgroup of patients as allergic rather than atopic.
   Concerning the clinical expression, rhinitis is the most prevalent
   symptom, while conjunctivitis is the most disabling. Pharmacological
   treatment of cypress allergies is not different from that of other
   seasonal allergies. Immunotherapy has been used, initially by
   subcutaneous injections, but currently mostly through the sublingual
   route. Although clinical trials have included only a limited number of
   patients, it has proven effective and safe. Avoidance can be implemented
   at the individual level, as well as at the community level, through the
   use of alternative plants, low-pollinating cypresses, or by trimming
   hedges before pollination.}},

Abstract = {{The documentation of many rare or declining bee species in urban green
   spaces has led to a recent focus on cities as conservation targets.
   However, for pollinator conservation to succeed long term, we argue that
   the opinions and values of local community members must be prioritized
   more explicitly. In our experience, conservation is difficult to achieve
   when the aesthetic and safety concerns of urban residents are not
   reconciled with the goals and habitat designs of conservation
   practitioners. Similarly, from a bee ecology perspective, many questions
   concerning optimal design and management practices for pollinator
   habitats in cities remain unresolved. It is our hope that frank
   discussion of the challenges associated with urban pollinator
   conservation in public green spaces will inspire thoughtful
   consideration of how best to implement new initiatives in cities.}},

Abstract = {{Object segmentation is a prominent and challenging issue pertaining to
   image analysis and computer vision applications. This segmentation
   enables a higher number of applications like image retrieval, object
   recognition and object reconstruction. Considering this importance of
   object segmentation, the ultimate aim of the proposed research work in
   this paper is to focus on color image segmentation that is visually
   triggered using the GBCPA, popularly known as global biotic
   cross-pollination algorithm dependent on evolutionary strategy models.
   Evolutionary techniques imitate the procedure of genetic evolution and
   make utilization of the operators of recombination, mutation and
   selection to create the new-generation individuals. The new flower
   pollination optimization algorithm (FPOA) proposed in this paper aims to
   improve the objective characteristics of the basic FPOA approach. The
   significant contribution here mainly focused on preventing the premature
   convergence for dealing with the complicated constraints of the color
   image segmentation problem. The performance of GBCPA is tested over a
   Gould segmentation data set comprising of 715 images, both urban and
   rural images. The data set is tested under various evaluation
   techniques, and the proposed algorithm results in better accuracy than
   the other methods considered in comparison with the existing literature.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Pollen dispersal in tropical seed plants is established mainly by biotic
   vectors, both in intact and fragmented environments. In urban
   landscapes, the segregation of natural remnants by an artificial matrix
   can reduce pollinator foraging efficiency. It is unknown how
   nectarivorous bats, regarded as long-distance pollen dispersers, respond
   to such habitat structure combined with city-related factors. Here, we
   investigated the pollen dispersal pattern between spatially segregated
   individuals of the bat-pollinated Bignoniaceae Crescentia cujete within
   an urban environment. From 2015 to 2017, we assessed their
   spatiotemporal structure, breeding system and annual fruit set in order
   to relate these factors to the bat activity in the region. We employed
   fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues to infer the role of bats in pollen
   flow. Adding to the low density of individuals, we found a low daily
   flower emission and low flowering synchrony (S = 0,092), all of which
   are traits that favor outcrossing. Individuals were distributed in two
   distant groups (>600 m), with no occurrence of dye flow between them. In
   contrast, flow within the same individual was intense, which points
   toward bats' territorial behavior. C. cujete is self-compatible, but not
   autogamous; therefore, despite few outcross events, bats could be
   ensuring the plant's year-round fruit production mainly through
   self-pollination. Our findings show restricted bat foraging extent,
   which affects overall pollen dispersal distance and population
   connectivity. These results can be extrapolated to natural
   metapopulations inserted in an urban matrix and serve as a groundwork
   for studying directly the effect of city-related factors on pollinator
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Urban landscapes are often florally rich due to extensive management of
   cultivated plants around the city. High abundance and diversity of these
   floral resources has been linked to more abundant and diverse pollinator
   communities, but little is known about how urban pollinators select from
   the wide variety of available flowers. This study provides unique
   insight into urban plant-pollinator interactions by examining how many
   plant taxa, and which taxa, are visited by pollinators. Over a
   three-year period, we observed foraging of urban pollinators across 63
   neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois (USA). We observed 1815
   plant-pollinator interactions between 24 pollinator morpho-types and 106
   plant taxa. An additional 57 plant taxa were flowering but not visited
   by pollinators. On average, each pollinator morpho-type visited 19 plant
   taxa, and most pollinators showed generalist tendencies. We identified
   42 plant taxa that were visited by more pollinator morpho-types than
   their floral abundance would predict; we call these `highly attractive'
   plants. In general, perennial and native plants received more pollinator
   visits than their counterparts, and ornamental plants were visited by
   more species than unintentional `weeds'. However, the two most-visited
   plant taxa were non-native, perennial weeds. Our results suggest that
   many flowering plants in cities are not visited by pollinators.
   Furthermore, the plant-pollinator network could be reduced to only four
   plant taxa without losing any pollinator morpho-types. To enhance urban
   pollinator conservation, urban residents can select ornamental plants
   from our list of `highly attractive' plant taxa, or can allow some of
   the highly attractive `weeds' to persist in their gardens.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{High urbanization pressure in Sub-Saharan Africa led to changes in the
   composition and configuration of rural and peri-urban agricultural
   production systems and to the establishment of highly market-oriented
   urban farming systems. Trees and shrubs, as a key component of
   agroecosystems, provide ecosystem services that support food security
   and agricultural productivity. However, the relationship between
   landscape structure, land use intensification, species diversity and
   functional diversity of woody plant communities particularly within the
   semi-arid environment of West Africa has received little attention. We
   combined GIS analyses and field sampling of woody plant communities of
   72 agricultural systems located in rural, peri-urban and urban areas of
   Tamale (Ghana) and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). From a landscape
   perspective, peri-urban systems in Ouagadougou formed a transition or
   interacting zone between rural and urban systems and were shaped by
   urban growth dynamics whereas in Tamale peri-urban systems constituted a
   simplification of the rural parkland habitats and was mainly determined
   by agricultural intensification. Woody plant communities showed a high
   functional richness along the rural-urban gradient and provided a
   variety of ecosystem services, with food provisioning as main good. A
   trade-off between two regulating services, bio-control of pests and
   pollination services, could be observed within urban and in part within
   peri-urban farming systems. Hence, obtaining a holistic understanding of
   how landscape structure that is shaped by city growth and agricultural
   intensification affects ecosystem services is fundamental if West
   African urban farmers are to be politically supported in their efforts
   to manage landscapes effectively and to ensure agro-ecosystem
   multi-functionality and productivity.}},

Title = {{Worldwide decline of the entomofauna: A review of its drivers}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{8-27}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a
   comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from
   across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our
   work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction
   of 40\% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In
   terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles
   (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major
   aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have
   already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect
   groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological
   niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the
   abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all
   adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left
   by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary
   generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large
   biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban
   settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of
   importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and
   urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and
   fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced
   species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly
   important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in
   colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of
   current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in
   pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable,
   ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse
   current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and
   safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition,
   effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted
   waters in both agricultural and urban environments.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the urban heat island effect, the time of plant pollination might
   markedly vary within the area of a city. However, existing pollen
   forecasts do not reflect the spatial variations in the pollen release
   time within a heterogeneous urban environment. The main objective of
   this study was to model the spatial pattern of flowering onset (and thus
   the moment of pollen release) in silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) in
   Poznan (Western Poland) using land surface temperature (LST) data and in
   situ phenological observations.
   The onset of silver birch flowering was observed at 34 urban and rural
   sites (973 trees) in Poznan from 2012 to 2014. Forty-four thermal
   variables were retrieved from MODerate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. To predict the spatio-temporal
   distribution of B. pendula flowering onset dates in a city, the ordinary
   and partial least squares, support vector machine and random forest
   regression models were applied. The models performance was examined by
   an internal repeated k-fold cross-validation and external validation
   with archival phenological data (2010). Birch flowering began
   significantly earlier in the urban sites compared to the rural sites
   (from -1.4 days in 2013, to -4.1 days in 2012). The maximum March LST
   difference between the urban and rural sites reached 2.4 degrees C in
   2013 and 4.5 degrees C in 2012. The random forest model performed best
   at validation stage, i.e. the root mean square error between the
   predicted and observed onset dates was 1.461 days, and the determination
   coefficient was 0.829.
   A calibrated model for predicting the timing of flowering in a
   heterogeneous city area is an important step in developing a fine-scale
   forecasting system that can directly estimate pollen exposure in places
   where allergy sufferers live. Importantly, by incorporating only
   pre-flowering thermal data into the model, location-specific allergy
   forecasts can be delivered to the public before the actual flowering
   time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Honey bees are the most important managed pollinators and provide income
   because of bee products. In Austria and Czechia, we monitored winter
   losses of honey bee colonies and also collected information on the
   apicultural sector, hive management, population dynamics and treatment
   against the mite Varroa destructor from 2013-14 to 2016-17. Numbers of
   beekeepers and colonies, colony density and percentage of beekeepers in
   human population are higher in Czechia than in Austria. Winter loss
   rates of honey bee colonies ranged from 8.1\% to 28.4\% in Austria and
   6.4\% to 19.4\% in Czechia, with significantly higher loss rates in all
   4 investigated winters in Austria. The portion of colonies lost because
   of living colonies with unsolvable queen problems ranged from 3.6 to
   4.4\% in Austria and from 2.2 to 3.0\% in Czechia. Despite of colony
   losses during winter, colony production in summer allows for
   compensation or even expansion of colony populations in both countries.
   We identified differences between the two countries in the treatments
   applied by beekeepers against the parasitic varroa mite. In Austria,
   organic acids are most commonly used, whereas the application of
   synthetic acaricides is widely spread in Czechia. Our study points at
   the better understanding of apiculture and the importance of
   international comparisons to facilitate our knowledge on honey bee
   colony losses.}},

   nesting seasons (generations). Epicharis nigrita is a univoltine species
   and nests are built during 3.5 months per year (middle November to
   February). Females dig their nests in flat, bare or sparsely vegetated
   sandy soil. The peak in nest density occurred at the end of December or
   in the first week of January (3.0-32.3 nests/m(2)), corresponding to
   900-9690 estimated nests in the area. Females performed about 10
   flights/day and, unexpectedly, spent the night outside the nest. The
   average period of female activity in each nest was 6.9 d. Nests
   contained 4-5 brood cells, different from other observations of this
   species. Female plasticity in the duration of activities at nests, and
   consequently the number of brood cells produced per nest, is discussed.
   The first direct record of Rhathymus bicolor emerging from E. nigrita

Abstract = {{Wild bees are indispensable pollinators, supporting global agricultural
   yield and angiosperm biodiversity. They are experiencing widespread
   declines, resulting from multiple interacting factors. The effects of
   urbanization, a major driver of ecological change, on bee populations
   are not well understood. Studies examining the aggregate response of
   wild bee abundance and diversity to urbanization tend to document minor
   changes. However, the use of aggregate metrics may mask trends in
   particular functional groups. We surveyed bee communities along an
   urban-to-rural gradient in SE Michigan, USA, and document a large change
   in observed sex ratio (OSR) along this gradient. OSR became more male
   biased as urbanization increased, mainly driven by a decline in medium
   and large bodied ground-nesting female bees. Nest site preference and
   body size mediated the effects of urbanization on OSR. Our results
   suggest that previously documented negative effects of urbanization on
   ground-nesting bees may underestimate the full impact of urbanization,
   and highlight the need for improved understanding of sex-based
   differences in the provision of pollination services by wild bees.}},

Abstract = {{Euglossini bees are considered pollinators of a wide variety of plants
   in the Neotropical region, but little is known about their floral
   preferences. In this study, we identified the botanical species used as
   pollen and nectar sources by three Euglossa species, Euglossa cordata
   (Linnaeus), E. townsendi Cockerell, and E. securigera Dressler using
   pollen residue found in brood cells from trap nests installed in an
   urban fragment in Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil. In 14 analyzed E. cordata
   nests, 23 pollen types were observed, in seven E. townsendi nests, ten
   pollen types were observed, and in one nest of E. securigera, six
   morphotypes were identified. Solanum (Solanaceae), Zanthoxylum
   (Rutaceae), Mimosa pudica L. (Fabaceae), and Chamaecrista (Fabaceae)
   pollen types were common to all three bee species. A principal component
   analysis showed 83.04\% variability on the first two axes, demonstrating
   substantial similarity among the samples. Solanum, Mimosa pudica, and
   Zanthoxylum were the principal components in the ranking. Larger
   diversity values (mean = 0.80) in some samples indicated that the
   species gathered resources in a heterogeneous manner; this is consistent
   with the findings of other studies of Euglossa. In general, the bees
   exhibited overlapping niches with regard to the most abundant pollen
   grains in the nests, but the females showed individual plasticity when
   gathering floral resources.}},

   The climate chamber experiment was carried out to determine main stem

   root fresh mass, as well as root length. Under climate chamber
   conditions, two melon cultivars {[}Galia type (citirex F-1) and Kirkagac
   Manisa Altmbas type (PI-169303 open pollinated)] were grafted onto two
   different commercial Cucurbita maxima x C. moschata hybrid rootstocks
   (Kardosa and Nun 9075) and grown in 8L pots filled continuously with
   aerated nutrient solution under two different pH levels (7 and 9) with
   three replications. The results indicated that grafted and ungrafted
   plants were significantly (P<0.001) affected by pH levels regarding leaf
   chlorophyll content (SPAD), branching number, shoot and root fresh mass,
   as well as root length, whereas there were no significant differences
   observed regarding main stem length. Grafted plants had better growth
   performance than ungrafted plants under both control and high pH
   conditions. Shoot fresh mass of the ungrafted and grafted plants
   significantly decreased as pH level increased, whereas root fresh mass
   of the ungrafted and grafted plants significantly increased under high
   pH level. Branching number was significantly (P<0.001) affected by
   grafting combinations and pH levels. Leaf chlorophyll content (SPAD) of
   the ungrafted and grafted plants significantly decreased as pH level
   increased, whereas branching number of the grafted plants significantly
   increased under high pH level. These results suggested that use of
   interspecific Cucurbita hybrid rootstocks could improve crop performance
   in melon plants under alkaline conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This work aimed to ascertain the triploid frequency of sexual

   Fortune' mandarin (Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan.xC. tangerina Hort. ex

   its reproductive characteristics, mainly the monoembryony and
   self-incompatibility. The male parents used were the Cravo' (C.
   reticulata, Blanco) and Dancy' (C. reticulata) mandarins. The
   pollinations were always manually performed in the morning, and the
   pollinated flowers were identified for control. During the flowering
   period, flower samples at different stages of development of the
   Fortune' variety were collected for histological analysis. Microspore
   development occurred regularly in the 4-5mm (length) phase of the floral
   buds, and a bicellular microgametophyte was formed in the
   floralbudswith5-6 mm in length. The formation of the female gametophyte
   occurred later, in flower buds with approximately 10mm in length. The
   hybridizations resulted in 19 triploid plants: five when the Cravo'
   mandarin was used as the male parent and 14 when Dancy' mandarin was
   used as the male parent, evidencing the importance of the male genitor
   also in this process.}},

Abstract = {{In tropical regions, habitat change and fragmentation partly occur due
   to urbanization. This change of land-use can affect many ecosystem
   services and their providers, such as pollination and pollinators.
   Within agricultural systems, monoculture systems and pesticide
   application are the most detrimental to pollinators and insect
   communities. In this study, we investigated the effect of distance from
   natural habitat on the diversity of insect pollinators and cucumber
   productivity. As the independent variable, distance from natural
   habitats was classified into two different groups i.e. agricultural area
   near to (less than 200m) and far from (more than 1km) the natural
   habitat. We found that the abundance of insect pollinators was
   significantly lower in agricultural areas near to natural habitats
   compared to those located far from natural habitats. Cucumber farms
   located near to natural habitats had 54\% similar species composition of
   insect pollinators with cucumber farms located far from natural
   habitats. The productivity of cucumbers did not differ between cucumber
   farms near to and far from natural habitats. An expected result was the
   positive correlation between pollinator abundance (i.e. Xylocopa spp.)
   and the productivity of cucumber. Our findings suggest that the
   diversity of pollinators in tropical agricultural landscape is
   influenced more by a landscape composition of high natural habitat
   fragments than spatial distance between cropland and natural habitats.}},

Title = {{Urbanization predicts infection risk by a protozoan parasite in
   non-migratory populations of monarch butterflies from the southern

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{649-661}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Context Urbanization can affect the density of hosts, altering patterns
   of infection risk in wildlife. Most studies examining associations
   between urbanization and host-parasite interactions have focused on
   vertebrate wildlife that carry zoonotic pathogens, and less is known
   about responses of other host taxa, including insects.
   Objectives Here we ask whether urban development predicts infection by a
   protozoan, Ophyrocystis elektroscirrha, in three populations of monarchs
   (Danaus plexippus): migratory monarchs in northeastern U.S.,
   non-migratory monarchs in southeastern coastal U.S., and non-migratory
   monarchs in Hawaii.
   Methods We used impervious surface and developed land cover classes from
   the National Land Cover Database to derive proportional measures of
   urban development and an index of land cover aggregation at two spatial
   scales. Parasite data were from previous field sampling (Hawaii) and a
   citizen science project focused on monarch infection in North America.
   Results Proportional measures of urban development predicted greater
   infection prevalence for non-migratory monarchs sampled in the southern
   coastal U.S. and Hawaii, but not in the northern U.S. Aggregations of
   low intensity development, dominated by single-family housing, predicted
   greater infection prevalence in monarchs from the northern and southern
   coastal U.S. populations, but predicted lower infection prevalence in
   Hawaii.
   Conclusions Because natural habitats have been reduced by land-use
   change, plantings for monarchs in residential areas and urban gardens
   has become popular among the public. Mechanisms that underlie higher
   infection prevalence in urban landscapes remain unknown. Further
   monitoring and experimental studies are needed to inform strategies for
   habitat management to lower infection risk for monarchs.}},

Title = {{Floral resource availability of Dicliptera squarrosa (Acanthaceae) and
   its dependence on hummingbirds for fruit formation in a forest fragment
   of Central Brazil}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{152}},

Pages = {{68-77}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims - Hummingbirds are dependent and specialized on
   nectar-feeding, and many plants depend upon them for pollination.
   However, the degree of plant-pollinator interdependence varies greatly
   among species; thus, information on plant mating systems and
   availability of resources may help to clarify the dependence of
   interacting organisms. The goals of this study Were to (I) quantify the
   floral resource available during the flowering of Dicliptera squarrosa
   Nees for comparison With other co-flowering ornithophilous species, and
   to (2) determine the importance of floral visitors for the reproductive
   success of this plant.
   Methods - Data collection was performed in a forest fragment within the
   urban perimeter of Catalao, Goias, from September 2012 to August 2013.
   We investigated the flowering phenology, floral biology, nectar
   characteristics, flower visitors and mating systems of D. squarroso.
   Additionally, WC evaluated the amount of floral resource offered (number
   of flowers and energy in joules) by co-flowering ornithophilous species
   within an area of 6000 m(2) for comparison with D. squarrosa.
   Key results - Dicliplera squarrosa presents flowers adapted to
   pollination by hummingbirds, which act as the sole pollinator group for
   flowers of this species. Flowering occurs from June to September and is
   synchronous with five other co-flowering species. During the months
   between July and September. D. squarrosa is the main food source for
   hummingbirds in the area, offering more floral resources than all of the
   other five ornithophilous species together. Plants of this species are
   self-compatible, but they depend on hummingbirds to transfer pollen;
   levels of autonomous autogamy were low.
   Conclusions - We suggest that D. squarrosa is an important species for
   maintaining hummingbirds in the forest fragment due to its high
   production of nectar resources. In addition, data on floral biology,
   flower visitors, and mating systems showed the importance of
   hummingbirds for reproduction of D. squarroso, suggesting a mutualistic
   interaction between plant and hummingbirds.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale declines in pollinator species are a concern at present.
   Such declines have been attributed to a range of factors that act in
   tandem, rather than in isolation. Some of the most pervasive factors
   affecting pollinator populations are habitat loss and degradation, which
   results in the loss of floral resources, nesting sites and landscape
   connectivity. Intensification of agriculture and urbanisation are two
   major causes of such habitat alterations. Hedgerows and grasslands are
   two vital habitats for pollinators in European landscapes. When managed
   appropriately, these habitats may provide abundant floral resources and
   nesting opportunities, as well as connectivity between habitats in a
   fragmented landscape. This study examined the effects that management
   practices of hedgerows and grasslands may have on bumblebee species, an
   important group of wild pollinators. Bumblebee abundance was recorded
   using transect walks in managed and unmanaged sites, including both
   hedgerows and grasslands. Greater densities of bumblebees were found in
   unmanaged grasslands in comparison to managed grasslands. Unmanaged
   hedgerows were also found to have a greater density of bumblebees than
   managed hedgerows. These results indicate that sites which are less
   intensively managed provide a more suitable habitat for bumblebees.
   Therefore, our study underlines the importance of (a) enforcing
   restrictions on hedge-cutting, and (b) reducing the management intensity
   of grasslands to provide adequate habitat for pollinators. (C) 2018

Title = {{Value of Sedum species as companion plants for nectar-producing plants
   depends on leaf characteristics of the Sedum}},
Journal = {{URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{35-44}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Introducing nectar-producing plants to green roofs and other urban green
   infrastructure has been attempted to support pollinator activities.
   Green roofs can be drought-prone, placing limitations on the success of
   plant growth and nectar production in the absence of irrigation. Plant
   species differ greatly in water usage patterns, so companion planting
   with low and high water users has been proposed to increase performance
   of high water use species, including species important for urban
   pollinators. Additionally, crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants
   such as Sedum tend to have low water usage and are reported to improve
   health condition of neighbors. However, Sedum species differ in
   morphological and physiological traits such as leaf shapes and the speed
   at which they switch to CAM, resulting in water usage differences during
   drought that could affect neighboring plants. This study quantifies the
   effects of companion planting with CAM plants (Sedum album, Sedum
   kamt-schaticum) on nectar-producing plants (Fagopyrum esculentum,
   Trifolium repens), focusing on target plant growth form and leaf traits
   of neighboring Sedum. The health condition of F. esuculentum and soil
   water contents were improved significantly when they were planted
   together with S. album, which has small leaves and rapid CAM induction.
   Therefore, suppression of evapotranspiration of neighboring CAM plants
   could have positive effects on erect growth form nectar species. In
   contrast, the health condition of T. repens, which shows prostrate
   growth, was not affected by neighboring CAM plant species. Judging from
   these results, growth characteristics including leaf traits of
   neighboring Sedum and growth forms of the target plants could be
   important factors determining the effects of companion planting in urban
   green infrastructure.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Both invasive species and their biological control agents face barriers
   to expansion, which provide opportunities to limit invasions or may
   enable target invasive species to exist in enemy-free space. A better
   understanding of the various barriers to the spread of insects
   introduced to control invasive plants will allow for more targeted
   release programs and potentially shorter lag times from introduction to
   management. In the Pacific Northwest of the United States, two seed
   eating beetles (Exapion fuscirostre and Bruchidius villosus) have been
   introduced to control the invasive plant Cytisus scoparius. These
   biological controls are predicted to be effective only at high rates of
   seed destruction, so any factors that limit their colonization or
   population sizes may allow C. scoparius populations to grow, leading to
   ecological and economic harm. In this study, we investigate relative
   impacts of biological control agents in relation to two barriers to
   insect movement: urbanization and elevation. We find that the impacts of
   B. villosus are not different between urban and rural sites, but that
   relative impacts of both biological control agents decrease with
   increasing elevation, a pattern consistent across 2years of
   measurements. Cytisus scoparius populations experience substantial seed
   destruction in urban settings, strongly suggesting successful population
   control. The low seed destruction at high elevation sites could indicate
   that biological control agents are ineffective there, and that C.
   scoparius may exist in enemy-reduced space.}},

Abstract = {{Urban areas are often perceived to have lower biodiversity than the
   wider countryside, but a few small-scale studies suggest that some urban
   land uses can support substantial pollinator populations. We present a
   large-scale, well-replicated study of floral resources and pollinators
   in 360 sites incorporating all major land uses in four British cities.
   Using a systems approach, we developed Bayesian network models
   integrating pollinator dispersal and resource switching to estimate
   city-scale effects of management interventions on plant-pollinator
   community robustness to species loss. We show that residential gardens
   and allotments (community gardens) are pollinator `hotspots': gardens
   due to their extensive area, and allotments due to their high pollinator
   diversity and leverage on city-scale plant-pollinator community
   robustness. Household income was positively associated with pollinator
   abundance in gardens, highlighting the influence of socioeconomic
   factors. Our results underpin urban planning recommendations to enhance
   pollinator conservation, using increasing city-scale community
   robustness as our measure of success.}},

Volume = {{212}},

Abstract = {{Global urbanization leads to the loss of periurban farming land and
   increases dependency on distant agriculture systems. This provokes
   greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation and storage
   while disconnecting nutrient cycles, as urban organic waste is not
   recycled into the agricultural system. Urban food production based on
   composted local biomass could reduce these problems, but currently used
   hybrid crops rely strongly on inorganic fertilizers. On the contrary,
   open-pollinated varieties were bred for productivity under organic
   fertilization, such as compost. Hypothesising that open-pollinated
   varieties retain high nutritional value under low nutrient conditions, a
   commercial hybrid and a local open-pollinated variety of maize were
   cultivated in non-fertilized soil and under two compost applications:
   Municipal compost as high nutrient input or locally produced green waste
   compost and municipal compost mix, as medium nutrient input.
   Unfertilized plots exhibited low grain production (1.9 t/ha), but yields
   under green waste compost/municipal compost (6.1 t/ha) and municipal
   compost (7.8 t/ha) treatments were comparable to observations from maize
   under inorganic fertilization. Contrary to the commercial variety, the
   open-pollinated variety exhibited higher grain micronutrient
   concentrations, e.g. 220\% higher zinc concentrations and lower
   accumulation of heavy metals, e.g. 74\% lower nickel concentrations.
   This variety-related effect was found in all treatments and was
   independent of soil micronutrient concentrations. In conclusion, both
   compost mixes were effective in increasing grain yield in both maize
   varieties. However, the open-pollinated variety produced grain with
   higher nutritional values in soil and all treatments, indicating it is
   potentially better suited for compost-based sustainable urban
   agriculture. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization induces rapid landscape and habitat modifications leading
   to alterations in species distribution patterns and biodiversity loss.
   As pollinating insects such as butterflies are particularly susceptible
   to urbanization, it is important to pinpoint the factors that could
   enhance their diversity in the urban areas in order to design adequate
   management and conservation actions. Our study aims to investigate the
   influence of land cover and local habitat characteristics on the
   butterfly diversity patterns and community structure in a densely built
   city in the eastern Mediterranean region. We carried out butterfly
   surveys (line transects) in 45 randomly selected sites, distributed
   along an urbanization gradient. In each site, we assessed the
   surrounding landscape by measuring the land cover in a 200-m buffer
   zone, and the local habitat by estimating the available plant resources
   along each transect. Overall, 1805 individuals belonging to 41 butterfly
   species were recorded. Land cover was found to have the strongest
   influence on butterfly species richness, abundance and community
   structure. Although plant resources were sufficiently available within
   the whole study area, the butterfly community was significantly poorer
   in the more urbanized areas, indicating the potential role of habitat
   fragmentation and patch isolation. In contrast, butterfly diversity was
   significantly higher in the peri-urban area, underlying its conservation
   value for butterflies in the urban landscape. We attribute these
   findings to the degradation of the more urbanized areas due to long-term
   inadequate planning and the disorganized expansion of the city.}},

Abstract = {{Obtaining citrus fruits without seeds is a recurrent objective for
   fanners as it is one of the most valued characteristics, especially in
   mandarins. `Afourer' tangor is a highly valuable well-established
   mandarin, and a high percentage of seeded fruits are produced under
   cross-pollination conditions. Several agronomic techniques have been
   suggested to control presence of seeds, such as covering with nets and
   copper sulfate (CuSO4) and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) treatments. Natural
   bee repellents are also proposed to reduce the number of seeds per
   fruit. In this study, we aimed to compare the effect of several
   agronomic treatments to reduce the seed number in `Afourer' mandarin. To
   this end, we assessed the effect of chemical and bee repellent
   treatments on the seed number per fruit and the side effect on yield and
   fruit diameter. Under these experimental conditions the two bee
   repellents, one based on zinc and one based on Capsicum annuum, were not
   useful for reducing the seed number per fruit in `Afourer' mandarin. The
   copper sulfate + GA(3) treatment reduced the seed number per fruit by
   only 35\%, and this efficiency was clearly not enough to reduce the seed
   number for commercial purposes. The most effective method to reduce the
   seed number per fruit was covering with nets, but this technique led to
   markedly reduced yields. Yield data was highly variable. Fruit diameter
   correlated positively with the seed number, but it was a weak
   relationship as the seed number explained only 15\% of fruit size
   variability (R-2 = 0.15).}},

Abstract = {{Triploid breeding is an effective way to obtain seedless hybrids. In
   addition to artificial breeding, some triploid cultivars occur naturally

   `Villafranca' fruit. Therefore, it has an unknown pollen parent. To
   characterize the pollen parent of `Yellow Bell', possible parental
   cultivars were genotyped using simple sequence repeat markers, and then
   the parental relationships were estimated by establishing the
   inheritance of triallelic marker genotypes. As a result, the
   pollen-donating parent of `Yellow Bell' was determined to be `Summer
   Fresh', which was growing 40 m from the maternal tree in the same
   orchard. The parentage of `Tahiti lime', a lime cultivar having a long
   cultivation history, was evaluated in a similar manner and it was
   confirmed that `Mexican lime' and a true lemon cultivar were the

Abstract = {{Until recently, Harpochilus (Acanthaceae) contained two morphologically
   distinct species, Harpochilus neesianus and H. phaeocarpus, from
   northeastern Brazil. During an analysis of herbarium collections, we
   found an undescribed species of Harpochilus from the Brazilian semiarid
   region. However, another group of botanists simultaneously discovered
   the species and described it as H. paraibanus. Harpochilus neesianus and
   H. paraibanus are similar due to their morphologically complex flowers
   specialized for bat pollination, nocturnal anthesis, and anthers with
   non-appendiculate thecae. Unlike H. neesianus and H. paraibanus, the
   floral morphology of H. phaeocarpus and Cyrtanthera citrina, a name used
   for several misidentified collections of H. paraibanus, is more similar
   to that of Justicia. Thus, these species are here combined under
   Justicia. We also provide additional information on the morphology,
   geographic distribution and conservation status of H. paraibanus, and
   propose lectotypes for Harpochilus, H. neesianus, and C. citrina.}},

Abstract = {{Bee populations are currently undergoing severe global declines driven
   by the interactive effects of a number of factors. Ongoing urbanisation
   has the potential to exacerbate bee declines, unless steps are taken to
   ensure appropriate floral resources are available. Sown wildflower
   strips are one way in which floral resources can be provided to urban
   bees. However, the use of these strips by pollinators in urban
   environments remains little studied. Here, we employ pollen
   metabarcoding of the rbcL gene to compare the foraging patterns of
   different bee species observed using urban sown wildflower strips in
   July 2016, with a goal of identifying which plant species are most
   important for bees. We also demonstrate the use of a non-destructive
   method of pollen collection. Bees were found to forage on a wide variety
   of plant genera and families, including a diverse range of plants from
   outside the wildflower plots, suggesting that foragers visiting sown
   wildflower strips also utilize other urban habitats. Particular plants
   within the wildflower strips dominated metabarcoding data, particularly
   Papaver rhoeas and Phacelia tanacetifolia. Overall, we demonstrate that
   pollinators observed in sown wildflower strips use certain sown
   foodplants as part of a larger urban matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization has detrimental effects on biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning, as agricultural and semi-natural habitats are converted
   into landscapes dominated by built features. Urban agricultural sites
   are a growing component of urban landscapes and have potential to serve
   as a source of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service
   provisioning in urban areas. In 19 urban agricultural sites, we
   investigated how surrounding land cover and local site variables
   supported bees and pollination services. We found the abundance of bees
   differentially responded to landscape and local scale variables
   depending on body size and nesting habit. Large-bodied bees, Bombus and
   Apis species, were positively associated with increasing amounts of
   impervious cover, while the abundance of small-bodied soil nesting
   Halictus species increased as the proportion of flower area, a local
   variable, increased. Bee richness declined with increasing levels of
   impervious cover, while bee community composition changed along a
   gradient of increasing impervious cover. Pollination services, measured
   at each site using sentinel cucumber plants, declined as hardscape, a
   local variable, increased. To improve bee conservation and pollination
   services in urban agricultural sites, our results suggest urban planning
   strategies should minimize impervious cover at large spatial scales
   while land managers should focus locally on incorporating floral
   resources, which increases food and nesting resources especially for
   smaller bee species. Local site design coupled with regional urban
   planning can advance the success of urban agriculture, while benefiting
   biodiversity by creating opportunities for pollinator conservation in
   urban landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Cities harbour considerable biodiversity and there has been an increased
   concern about the conservation of pollinators in urban environments.
   Here, we evaluated how urbanization affects plant-hummingbird
   interactions at two spatial scales. First, in a medium-sized city from
   southeastern Brazil ( > 600,000 inhabitants), we contrasted interaction
   networks from urban and natural areas, and used artificial nectar feeder
   stations to evaluate changes in the composition of hummingbird
   assemblages across an urbanization gradient. Second, we compiled data on
   six urban plant-hummingbird interaction networks from south and
   southeastern Brazil to identify the characteristics associated with the
   most important plants. Locally, urbanization affected hummingbird
   communities by promoting higher generalization and dominance by more
   aggressive hummingbirds. Notably, specialized long-billed hermits were
   absent both in the urban interaction network and at feeder stations from
   more urbanized areas. Across networks, trees were more important for
   hummingbirds than shrubs/herbs as were specialized ornithophilous
   flowers in relation to non-ornithophilous flowers. Plant origin (native
   or exotic) did not matter. Our results indicate that urban
   plant-hummingbird communities are organized differently than their
   counterparts from natural areas, which usually feature key hermits and
   few trees. Since hermits provide important pollination services,
   especially for specialized ornithophilous plants, initiatives such as
   green corridors and preference for native plants with specialized
   hummingbird-pollinated flowers in urban landscaping may contribute to
   community restoration and ecosystem functioning.}},

Title = {{Inter- and Intracultivar Variation of Heirloom and Open-pollinated
   Watermelon Cultivars}},
Journal = {{HORTSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{212+}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Watermelon {[}Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. \& Nakai] cultivars
   exhibit diverse phenotypic traits, yet are derived from a narrow genetic
   base. Heirloom cultivars, and to a lesser extent modern open-pollinated
   (OP) cultivars, are perceived to contain vital genetic variation that is
   critical for biodiversity conservation and crop improvement. The
   objective of this study was to characterize the diversity of six
   heirloom and open-pollinated watermelon cultivars that are popular among
   U.S. organic, direct-market, and home gardeners. An additional
   evaluation was conducted to determine whether significant phenotypic and
   genotypic variation existed among seed lots sourced from different
   commercial seed vendors. Important horticultural traits such as days to
   germination, days to first flower, yield, and fruit quality were
   measured over two field seasons. Genetic diversity was estimated using
   32 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Significant differences in
   horticultural traits among seed lots in both years were observed only in
   days to germination and first male flower, which may be a consequence of
   vendor differences in seed storage and quality control. Heirloom `Moon
   and Stars' and modern OP `Sugar Baby' were the most genetically distinct
   from the other cultivars and heirloom `Georgia Rattlesnake' was
   determined to be highly related to the modern OP `Charleston Gray'. The
   two heirloom cultivars were observed to have lower average gene
   diversity than the modern cultivars. Heirloom `Moon and Stars' contained
   significant genetic variation among seed lots, yet heirloom `Georgia
   Rattlesnake' contained none. These findings suggest that genetic
   variation can be more accurately attributed to pedigree and foundation
   seed maintenance practices than to the `'heirloom'' designation per se.
   The variation reported in this study can be used to inform conservation
   and breeding efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Diaphania hyalinata is an important pest in organic melon crops and has
   caused considerable harm to growers in northeastern Brazil. The aim of
   the present study was to determine the chemical composition of essential
   oils from Eugenia uniflora (pitanga) and Cinnamomum zeylanicum
   (cinnamon) as well as evaluate the repellant action, oviposition
   deterrence and effect on body mass caused by the oils and the
   constituents linalool and beta-pinene in D. hyalinata. The essential
   oils from pitanga and cinnamon had a predominance of sesquiterpenes and
   phenylpropanoids, respectively. The pitanga oil was more effective as a
   larval repellent than the cinnamon oil and the constituents tested
   exhibited low repellent activity. In the evaluation of oviposition
   deterrence, the response of D. hyalinata exposed to the cinnamon oil did
   not vary with the distance between the treated and untreated leaf disks,
   but varied significantly when exposed to the pitanga oil. Linalool
   exhibited greater long-distance oviposition deterrence in comparison
   with beta-pinene. In the experiments on body mass gain, second-instar
   larvae were more susceptible to the cinnamon oil than the pitanga oil
   and constituents tested. The findings suggest that these oils,
   especially the pitanga oil, could be an alternative for the control of
   D. hyalinata in the larval and adult phases. Further studies are needed
   to evaluate the effect on natural enemies and pollinating insects as
   well as the cost- benefit of the formulation of an insecticide for use
   on organic crops in northeastern Brazil.}},

Abstract = {{ContextIdentifying core migratory pathways and associated threats is
   important for developing conservation priorities for declining migratory
   species, such as eastern monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus
   L.).ObjectivesCharacterization of monarch fall migration core pathways
   and annual variability was compared using kernel density estimation
   models (KDEMs) and MaxEnt ecological niche models. Potential
   anthropogenic hazards were identified across migratory pathways and
   related to conservation strategies.MethodsJourney North citizen
   scientist monarch overnight roost data from 2002 to 2016 were used to
   model the fall migration at 10km spatial resolution with MaxEnt and
   KDEMs. Potential anthropogenic threats to the fall migration were
   spatially identified along core migratory routes.ResultsThe KDEM
   migratory pathways best represented patterns of monarch movement towards
   overwintering locations. Migratory routes varied as much as 200km from
   east to west in the southern Central Flyway, which was also the only
   area identified with monarch roadkill hotspots. Potential threats from
   mosquito adulticide ultra-low volume (ULV) spraying were concentrated
   along Eastern Flyway coastal areas. Potential nectar resource loss or
   contamination from high usage of glyphosate herbicide and neonicotinoid
   insecticides was greatest in the Midwest, within the core route of the
   Central Flyway.ConclusionsMaxEnt and KDEM were complementary in modeling
   monarch migratory pathways. Monarch roadkill estimation and mitigation
   strategies are most needed in the southern core migratory pathways
   through Texas and Mexico. High quality nectar resourceenhancement could
   help to mitigate potential threats from mosquito ULV spraying and nectar
   resource loss or contamination in coastal areas and the Midwest,

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new approachunderstood as a
   whole-of-community approachto address a dualistic and dysfunctional
   human/nature relationship. Of particular concern is the decline in
   health and numbers of the insects that pollinate an estimated 90 percent
   of the Earth's flora and an estimated 35 percent of global crop volume.
   Specifically, bees provide the majority of biotic pollination and play a
   critical role in food crop pollination. Multiple factors are
   contributing to this growing problem including a changing climate. In
   2016, the International Commission on Stratigraphy agreed that the
   concept of the Anthropocenethe human epochis of sufficient scale to be
   considered part of the geological time scale. This indicates that these
   crises are not random or passivethey are largely the direct result of
   human activities. Despite decades of awareness of these socio-ecological
   issues, they continue to worsen. In addition, the growing awareness of
   the critical role of pollinators is creating a new understanding of our
   interconnectedness with the natural world. We introduce the Bee City
   movement as a way to operationalize a whole-of-community approach.
   Individual action is critical, but addressing pollinator health in these
   forums legitimizes and provides an institutional space for otherwise
   fringe, or even marginalized, activities and more coherent spaces for
   habitat creation.}},

Title = {{Fluorescent Pan Traps Affect the Capture Rate of Insect Orders in
   Different Ways}},
Journal = {{INSECTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{To monitor and quantify the changes in pollinator communities over time,
   it is important to have robust survey techniques of insect populations.
   Pan traps allow for the assessment of the relative insect abundance in
   an environment and have been promoted by the Food and Agricultural
   Organization (FAO) as an efficient data collection methodology. It has
   been proposed that fluorescent pan traps are particularly useful, as it
   has been suggested that they capture high numbers of insects in an
   unbiased fashion. We use a simultaneous presentation of fluorescent and
   non-fluorescent pan trap colours to assess how flower-visiting insects
   of different orders respond to visual stimuli and reveal a significant
   interaction between trap fluorescence and captured insect type. In
   particular, Coleoptera (beetles) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths)
   were captured significantly more frequently by fluorescent traps, whilst
   Dipterans (flies) were captured significantly less frequently by this
   type of pan trap. Hymenopterans (bees and wasps) showed no significant
   difference in their preference for fluorescent or non-fluorescent traps.
   Our results reveal that the use of fluorescent pan traps may differently
   bias insect capture rates when compared to the typical experience of
   colour flower-visiting insects in natural environments. Correction
   factors may, therefore, be required for interpreting insect pan trap
   data collected with different methodologies.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-62}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Bumble bees (Bombus) play key roles as pollinators in temperate
   ecosystems. Some North American species have declined due to factors
   that include habitat loss, parasites, pesticides, and climate change. In
   many regions conservation is hampered by lack of quantitative data on
   historical abundance and distribution, making status assessments
   difficult. From 2012 to 2014, with help from 53 citizen scientists, we
   conducted surveys to determine the status of bumble bees throughout
   Vermont, USA. For historical comparison, we identified and digitized
   bumble bee specimens from 13 public and private collections. Our dataset
   contained 12,319 records, which we separated into historic (1915-1999;
   n=1669) and modern (2000-2014; n=10,650) periods, with our survey
   contributing 94\% of modern data. Of 17 species, four were not detected
   and four showed significant declines. Rarefaction indicated that both
   modern and historic datasets slightly underestimated known species
   richness, diversity, and abundance, but confirmed a strong decline for
   all three parameters. Declining species broadly accorded with those
   reported elsewhere in eastern North America, and included those in
   subgenera Bombus, Fervidobombus, and Psithyrus. Four species in the
   subgenus Pyrobombus (B. bimaculatus, B. impatiens, B. ternarius, and B.
   vagans) greatly increased in relative abundance in the modern period.
   Landscape factors such as road density, elevation, and land use strongly
   predicted distribution of some species. Species diversity was correlated
   positively with grasslands, and negatively with deciduous and mixed
   forest cover, while abundance was correlated positively with evergreen
   forest cover, yet negatively with deciduous forest.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of sugar yield-related traits can
   promote the discovery of new sugar yield-related genes. Subsequently,
   marker-assisted selection (MAS) can be used to breed new high-yield
   sugar beet varieties. In this study, we observed the F-1 population (219
   individuals) from a cross of 3a (high-yield, low-sugar, diploid,
   monogerm, sterile line) and 3b (low-yield, high-sugar, diploid,
   polyembryonic, pollinated line) parents located in Gaomi City, Shandong
   Province, China. A total of four traits (root length, root perimeter,
   root weight, and sugar content) exhibited a normal distribution. Based
   on a high-density genetic map, including 3287 specific-length amplified
   fragment markers and nine linkage groups (LGs) with an overall genetic
   distance of 1554.64cM, a total of 32 QTLs were identified for the four
   aforementioned traits. The QTLs were distributed on LG2, LG3, LG5, LG7,
   and LG9. The root length was mapped to six regions of LG2. The
   phenotypic variance explained (PVE) ranged from 6.30\% to 8.03\%. The
   root perimeter was mapped to five regions of LG5 and 12 regions of LG7.
   The largest PVE was on LG5 (7.23\%). The root weight was mapped to two
   regions of LG3 and three regions of LG7. The four sugar content-related
   QTLs located on LG5 and LG9 had a threshold logarithm of odds (LOD)
   value of 4.35 and a max PVE of 10.13\%, indicating a potentially
   important QTL for future gene cloning. Using trait-based QTL mapping and
   chromosomal marker distribution data, we identified 3690 candidate genes
   including 191 root length, 918 root perimeter, 409 root weight, and 2172
   sugar content genes. Our results provide valuable information for
   additional research in fine mapping, gene functional analysis, pyramid
   breeding, and MAS.}},

Title = {{Urbanization threaten the pollination of Gentiana dahurica}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{With rapid spread of the urbanization, many environmental factors, such
   as climate, soil pH and nutrients have been changed. However, the plant
   pollination affected by urbanization was seldom conducted. Here, we
   studied the flower visitation rates, seed production, pollen limitation
   and flower morphological characters of Gentiana dahurica at 3
   populations along an urban-peri-urban gradient around Xi'ning over 4
   consecutive years, aiming to test the effects of urbanization on plant
   pollination service. Our results showed that the pollinator visit
   frequencies, interannual stability of pollinator assemblages and visit
   frequencies declined with the intensification of urbanization. As
   urbanization intensified, plant borne more flowers and the flower
   morphological sizes became ``longer{''} (the length of flowers,
   filaments and styles were increased, but the width of flowers kept
   stable at the 3 populations); the flower duration, especially the female
   phase duration prolonged. The seed-set ratio of G. dahurica in natural
   condition decreased and more severe pollen limitation occurred in more
   urbanized populations. Also, an interannual variation of seed-set ratio
   and index of pollen limitation (IPL), which related with the variation
   of pollinator visit frequencies, were found in this study. These results
   suggest that the pollination service can be threatened by urbanization
   over a long-time interval for G. dahurica. This finding highlights the
   importance of pollinator affections acting on plant pollination system.
   Additionally, as pollinator assemblages and visit frequencies
   interannually changed, a long-time scale observation is needed to
   understand the plant-pollinator relationships.}},

Abstract = {{This research work crucially deals with a techno-economic feasibility
   study for off-grid solar photovoltaic fuel cell (PV/FC) hybrid systems.
   The hybrid renewable energy system is investigated for feeding electric
   to remote areas and isolated urban regions in Egypt. To achieve this
   goal, all the system equipment are modeled, simulated and the area under
   study data is gathered. The objective function is formulated depending
   on the total annual cost (TAC). The Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA),
   as an efficient recent metaheuristic optimization method, proposed to
   estimate the optimum number of both PV panels and the
   FC/electrolyzer/H-2 storage tanks set mandatory where the least total
   net present value (TNPV) is reached.
   The loss of power supply probability (LPSP) is considered to enhance the
   performance of the proposed design. The effect of the variation of FC,
   electrolyzer, H-2 storage tanks and the PV power system initial cost on
   the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is presented through a comprehensive
   sensitivity analysis.
   Through Matlab (TM) program, the numerical simulation results obtained
   by the FPA algorithm have been compared to the corresponding outcomes
   while using the artificial bee colony (ABC) and the Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO) techniques. According to the simulation outcomes
   analysis, the FPA Algorithm has the less fulfillment time and good
   rendering between the other algorithms. In addition, the optimum system
   configuration is acquired using FPA with the optimal hybridization of 27
   solar PV, 28 FCs, 58 electrolyzers and 37 H-2 storage tanks for an LPSP
   and PEE of 1.52\% and 4.68\% respectively. The system TNPV is
   \$3,244,897 with the LCOE of 0.334 \$/kWh. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy

Title = {{Decades of native bee biodiversity surveys at Pinnacles National Park
   highlight the importance of monitoring natural areas over time}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Thousands of species of bees are in global decline, yet research
   addressing the ecology and status of these wild pollinators lags far
   behind work being done to address similar impacts on the managed honey
   bee. This knowledge gap is especially glaring in natural areas, despite
   knowledge that protected habitats harbor and export diverse bee
   communities into nearby croplands where their pollination services have
   been valued at over \$3 billion per year. Surrounded by ranches and
   farmlands, Pinnacles National Park in the Inner South Coast Range of
   California contains intact Mediterranean chaparral shrubland. This
   habitat type is among the most valuable for bee biodiversity worldwide,
   as well as one of the most vulnerable to agricultural conversion,
   urbanization and climate change. Pinnacles National Park is also one of
   a very few locations where extensive native bee inventory efforts have
   been repeated over time. This park thus presents a valuable and rare
   opportunity to monitor long-term trends and baseline variability of
   native bees in natural habitats. Fifteen years after a species inventory
   marked Pinnacles as a biodiversity hotspot for native bees, we
   resurveyed these native bee communities over two flowering seasons using
   a systematic, plot-based design. Combining results, we report a total of
   450 bee species within this 109km(2) natural area of California,
   including 48 new species records as of 2012 and 95 species not seen
   since 1999. As far as we are aware, this species richness marks
   Pinnacles National Park as one of the most densely diverse places known
   for native bees. We explore patterns of bee diversity across this
   protected landscape, compare results to other surveyed natural areas,
   and highlight the need for additional repeated inventories in protected
   areas over time amid widespread concerns of bee declines.}},

Abstract = {{Climate-induced changes in spatial and temporal occurrence of species,
   as well as species traits such as body size, each have the potential to
   decouple symbiotic relationships. Past work has focused primarily on
   direct interactions, particularly those between predators and prey and
   between plants and pollinators, but studies have rarely demonstrated
   significant fitness costs to the interacting, coevolving organisms.
   Here, we demonstrate that changing phenological synchrony in the latter
   part of the 20th century has different fitness outcomes for the actors
   within a Batesian mimicry complex, where predators learn to
   differentiate harmful ``model{''} organisms (stinging Hymenoptera) from
   harmless ``mimics{''} (hoverflies, Diptera: Syrphidae). We define the
   mimetic relationships between 2,352 pairs of stinging Hymenoptera and
   their Syrphidae mimics based on a large-scale citizen science project
   and demonstrate that there is no relationship between the phenological
   shifts of models and their mimics. Using computer game-based
   experiments, we confirm that the fitness of models, mimics, and
   predators differs among phenological scenarios, creating a
   phenologically antagonistic system. Finally, we show that climate change
   is increasing the proportion of mimetic interactions in which models
   occur first and reducing mimic-first and random patterns of occurrence,
   potentially leading to complex fitness costs and benefits across all
   three actors. Our results provide strong evidence for an overlooked
   example of fitness consequences from changing phenological synchrony.}},

Abstract = {{Biogenic aerosols may play an active role in various diseases. Pollutant
   gases and bioaerosols coexist in the atmosphere with the possibility of

   allergies) and both the main atmospheric pollutants and the
   meteorological parameters has enabled us to identify the main factors
   that affect pollen concentration in the atmosphere. This study analyzes
   the long-term trend in CO, NO, NO2, PM10, SO2 and O-3 from 1997 to 2016
   and Praxinus, Poaceae and Populus pollen concentrations in the city of
   Leon from 1994 to 2016. In general, there is a significant decreasing
   trend in atmospheric pollutant concentrations and a significant
   increasing trend in Praxinus pollen concentrations. In addition, the
   influence of air pollutants and climatic factors on pollen
   concentrations and pollination period duration was studied using the
   Spearman correlation, showing that the flowering and pollination periods
   depend largely of the weather conditions before these periods and are
   influenced by air pollutant concentrations.}},

Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Urban expansion is correlated to negative biodiversity trends. The
   amount of impervious surfaces in urban areas is a determinant of
   pollinator species assemblages. While the increase in urbanization and
   impervious surfaces negatively impacts pollinators, cities also
   encompass urban green spaces, which have a significant capacity to
   support biodiversity. Among them, domestic gardens that represent a
   non-negligible fraction of green spaces have been shown to benefit
   pollinators. Domestic gardens may form habitat clusters in residential
   areas, although their value at a landscape scale is still unknown. Here,
   we investigate the combined effects of impervious surfaces and domestic
   garden areas on pollinator richness. Due to the difficulty of accessing
   privately owned domestic gardens, we chose to use citizen science data
   from a well-established French citizen science program known as SPIPOLL.
   Using regression tree analysis on buffers located from 50m to 1000m
   around the data points, we show the importance of pollinators being in
   close proximity to domestic gardens as locally favorable habitats that
   are embedded within a landscape, in which impervious surfaces represent
   unfavorable areas. We highlight the inter-connection between local and
   landscape scales, the potential for patches of domestic gardens in
   residential areas, and the need to consider the potential of gardeners'
   coordinated management decisions within a landscape context. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Mosaic structure of urban green areas is regarded as favorable for
   pollinating insects. Ornamental plants can provide food resources to
   pollinators and may thus be used to create pollinator-friendly habitats.
   However, detailed data on forage quantity and quality is required for
   the selection of the most valuable plant species. In this paper,
   blooming biology, pollen production, and insect visitors of two forms
   (blue-flower and white-flower) of Polemonium caeruleum were studied in
   the period of 2012-2014 in Lublin, SE Poland. Both forms bloomed from
   mid-May until mid-June. The average mass of pollen produced in a single
   flower was 1.57 mg and 1.39 mg in blue-flower and white-flower forms,
   respectively. On average, the blue-flower form produced 7.74 g of
   pollen/m(2), while the white-flower form yielded 6.54 g of pollen/m(2).
   Both forms attracted mainly honey bees and solitary bees. Polemonium
   caeruleum can be considered a good source of pollen for honey bees and
   wild insect pollinators and should be propagated in urban
   pollinator-friendly arrangements.}},

Journal = {{ACTA AGROBOTANICA}},

Abstract = {{Historical urban parks are particularly valuable in terms of their
   ecology, as they offer habitats to many valuable flora and fauna. A
   study was conducted in Felin Manor Park, Lublin, southeastern Poland,
   dating back to the end of the nineteenth and the first half of twentieth
   century. The aim of the study was to assess the suitability of this type
   of urban park for the proecological design of urban green areas that
   will comply with the legal requirements for historic gardens. The
   investigation demonstrate that long-living native tree species (e.g.,
   Tilia cordata, Quercus robur, and Fraxinus excelsior) are the best
   preserved plants in this park. The dendroflora of the park is, however,
   characterized by a great variety of species flowering between early
   spring and fall. These reward species ensure continuity of the food base
   for insects throughout the vegetation season. A floristic inventory
   facilitated development of a concept for the restoration of the park
   combining cultural (historical, educational) and ecological functions.
   Tilia cordata was used for line planting arrangements along the park
   boundary. It is a component of the alley design along the driveway and
   is one of the most valuable nectar reward species. The survey allowed
   the definition of future design guidelines, i.e., the preservation of
   the historical park structures (formed by long-living native species)
   and complementation of the park dendroflora with species that are
   attractive for bees and other insect pollinators. To supplement their
   food base, it is recommended that a ``bee garden{''} with herbaceous
   reward plants should be created.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen tube growth was examined to demonstrate the degree of
   self-incompatibility reaction in the pistils of 121 Citrus accessions
   including 77 pummelo accessions. One hundred of the 121 accessions were
   determined to be self-incompatible with the aid of an epifluorescent
   microscope. Based on the difference of self pollen tube growth between
   the self-incompatible and self-compatible accessions, the degree of
   self-incompatibility reaction in four portions of the pistils was
   roughly divided into three categories, i.e., high (H), moderate (M) and
   low (L). The degrees of the reaction in the stigmas, upper styles,
   middle styles and basal styles of these accessions were
   high-high-high-high (H-H-H-H), moderate-high-high-high (M-H-H-H),
   moderate-moderate-high-high (M-M-H-H), low-high-high-high (L-H-H-H),
   low-moderate-high-high (L-M-H-H) or low-low-high-high (L-L-H-H) in order
   from the stigma to lower style, and were designated as H, MH, MMH, LH,
   LMH and LLH types respectively. All of 77 pummelo accessions examined
   were self-incompatible and all of the seven types of
   self-incompatibility reaction were observed in the accessions of which
   about 80\% showed either H or MH type of reaction. The degree of
   self-incompatibility reaction was more variable in the pummelo
   accessions originating in Southeast Asia than those in Japan. In three
   mandarin relatives and four yuzu relatives, the H and MH types of
   self-incompatibility reaction were exclusively found. These results
   suggested that the degree of self incompatibility reaction in each part
   of style was different in different Citrus accessions and showed
   geographical diversity. The reason for this is discussed.}},

Booktitle = {{HALOPHYTES AND CLIMATE CHANGE: ADAPTIVE MECHANISMS AND POTENTIAL USES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Pages = {{19-37}},
Abstract = {{Salt-tolerant plants occur all over the world in a number of different
   ecosystems, ranging from pristine alkaline semi-deserts and mangrove
   forests; through semi-natural meadows and pastures; to man-made habitats
   such as the environs of graduation towers; over irrigated arable lands
   with poor drainage in the tropics; and to city lawns in the
   boreo-temperate zone polluted with NaCl and CaCl2 during deicing.
   Natural habitats disappear because of urbanization, tourism and
   agriculture intensification. Since 1980 one-fifth of the Earth's
   mangrove biome has disappeared as well as more than one-half of alkaline
   steppes and nearly all Earth's coastal and inland salt meadows,
   glassworts and other annual communities of muds and sands, Mediterranean
   and warm Atlantic halophilous scrubs, vegetated sea cliffs and machairs.
   At the same time halophytes colonize new, man-made habitats, becoming
   dominant or even the sole species there. Some salt-resistant species,
   such as Rhizophora mangle in Hawaii and Spartina anglica in the UK,
   become dangerous invasive species. Mangrove swamps deserve more
   efficient conservation and restoration efforts since they shelter coasts
   from erosion, tsunami and storm surge; trap a wide variety of heavy
   metals; and provide habitats for juvenile fish, oysters and crustaceans.
   In the temperate and boreal zones the traditional land use of saline
   meadows and pastures needs to be maintained to preserve the original
   biodiversity and ecosystem services. Further halophyte domestication
   will lead to establishment of completely new, artificial agro-ecosystems
   to yield food, fodder and fuel, as well as fibre and phytoremediation,
   for rapidly expanding human populations. A range of halophyte crop
   cultivation systems can help to reduce damage caused by salinization of
   soils and freshwater, increase food production up to 70\% by 2050 and
   combat coastal erosion in the era of climate change and global
   pollinator crisis. At the same time we need to eradicate some
   monospecific thickets built by invasive, alien halophytes to restore
   primeval, species-rich communities in areas of naturally high salinity.}},

Abstract = {{Diploid seedless watermelon is produced using soft X-ray irradiated

   The fruit set rate of diploid seedless watermelon differed from that of
   each tetraploid watermelon line and showed a high correlation with the
   number of watermelon seeds produced by self-pollination. The fruit set
   rate was lower when pollens from tetraploid plants were used than when
   soft X-ray-irradiated pollen was used, but the qualities of watermelons
   produced were similar. The pollen tube germination rate of tetraploid
   plants was lower than diploid ones in vivo and in vitro. The shape of
   tetraploid watermelon pollen was incomplete and uneven compared to that
   of diploid pollen. Most tetraploid watermelon pollen had no pore, but
   some had as many as four pores. These results suggest that production of
   diploid seedless watermelon requires a tetraploid with normal

Abstract = {{Bees are highly sensitive to environmental disturbance as they depend on
   floral resources in both their larval and adult life stages. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the influence of surrounding habitat
   quality on variation in body size and corbiculae area of the Neotropical
   stingless bee, Melipona fasciculata (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini) in
   the eastern Brazilian Amazon. We collected a total of 115 bees from
   managed colonies in an urban area (BEL), and 115 bees from colonies in a
   preserved area (BRG). We compared bee body sizes of different castes
   (workers, gynes and drones) between BEL and BGR. We also compared
   variation in the corbiculae area of worker bees between the two areas.
   Our results showed that worker body size and males of M. fasciculata did
   not change between urban and preserved sites. However, gyne body size
   and worker corbiculae area were larger in individuals collected from BRG
   compared to those from BEL. We conclude that the differential
   nutritional statuses of colonies in urban and preserved regions, as a
   result of inter-regional discrepancies in floral resource availability,
   influenced adult body size and morphological traits of M. fasciculata,

Abstract = {{Reducing delay and latency in cloud com- puting environment is a
   challenging task for the research community. There are several smart
   cities in the world. These smart cities contain numerous Smart
   Communities (SCs), which have number of Smart Buildings (SBs) and Smart
   Homes (SHs). They require resources to process and store data in cloud.
   To overcome these challenges, another infrastructure fog computing
   environment is introduced, which plays an important role to enhance the
   efficiency of cloud. The Virtual Machines (VMs) are installed on fog
   server to whom consumers' requests are allocated. In this paper, the
   cloud and fog based integrated environment is proposed. To overcome the
   delay and latency issues of cloud and to enhance the performance of fog.
   When there are a large number of incoming requests on fog and cloud,
   load balancing is another major issue. This issue has also been resolved
   in this paper. The load balancing algorithm Cuckoo search with Levy Walk
   distribution (CLW) and Flower Pollination (FP) are proposed. The
   proposed algorithms are compared with existing Cuckoo Search (CS) and
   BAT algorithm. The comparative analysis of these proposed and existing
   techniques are performed on the basis of Closest Data Center (CDC),
   Optimize Response Time (ORT) and Reconfigure Dynamically with Load
   (RDL). The RT of DCs of cloud and clusters, Processing Time (PT) of fogs
   is also optimized on the basis of CLW and FP.}},

Abstract = {{The total solar eclipse of 21 August 2017 traversed 5000 km from coast
   to coast of North America. In its 90-min span, sunlight dropped by three
   orders of magnitude and temperature by 10-15 degrees C. To investigate
   impacts of these changes on bee (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) pollinators, we
   monitored their flights acoustically in natural habitats of Pacific
   Coast, Rocky Mountain, and Midwest regions. Temperature changes during
   the eclipse had little impact on bee activity. Most of the explained
   variation (R-2) in buzzing rate was attributable to changes in light
   intensity. Bees ceased flying during complete darkness at totality, but
   flight activity was unaffected by dim light in partial phases before and
   after totality. Flights of bees during partial phases of the eclipse
   lasted longer than flights made under full sun, showing that behavioral
   plasticity matched bee flight properties to changes in light intensity
   during the eclipse. Efforts of citizen scientists, including hundreds of
   school children, contributed to the scope and educational impact of this
   study.}},

Title = {{Range expansion of an already widespread bee under climate change}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is a key threat to pollination networks and has already
   caused shifts in the distribution and phenology of many bee species.
   Predictions based on species distribution models forecast that most bee
   species will continue to decline as climate change progresses, the few
   exceptions to this being common, widespread species with large dispersal
   capabilities. Most of the bees studied so far are temperate or tropical
   species but many ecosystems are predicted to experience increased
   aridification under climate change. Therefore, we need to understand how
   pollinator species are likely to respond. Here we present species
   distribution models for the arid-adapted Australian small carpenter bee,
   Ceratina australensis Perkins, 1912 (Apidae: Xylocopinae) under
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change
   conditions predicted for 2070 (Representative Carbon Pathway 8.5). We
   applied Maximum Entropy, Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive
   Models and Random Forest methods. Overall, our models predict that this
   bee will have an increased area of suitable habitat as climate change
   progresses, including an increased range within protected areas.
   However, its potential range will shift further into coastal areas, that
   are highly human populated and urbanised. Our results suggest that wild
   bee taxa may be able to cope with the predicted scale of future
   aridification under climate change. Finally, this species is predicted
   to increase in urban environments, which highlights the need for city
   planning, suitable habitats and green spaces to support wild bee
   species. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Assessing the efficacy of citizen scientists monitoring native bees in
   urban areas}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{With growing human population, urban areas expand, and natural spaces
   become more fragmented threatening the important ecosystem services
   provided by bee pollinators. Urbanization also provides a wealth of
   opportunities in the way of citizens who are willing to engage and
   develop strategies that improve the quality of urban areas. Knowing that
   pollinator conservation is a critical issue, we launched Native Bee
   Watch, a citizen science project to monitor bees in Fort Collins, a
   fast-growing urban center in northern Colorado, USA. Relying on citizen
   scientists presents challenges in data accuracy leading to the current
   study with objectives aimed to develop a protocol for accurate bee
   identification and determine whether citizen scientists following the
   protocol collect accurate data on bee diversity. The different genera of
   bees were grouped into eight morphospecies categories. Citizen
   scientists received intensive training prior to the start of the
   biweekly monitoring and researchers monitored during the off-weeks. We
   had very high volunteer retention rates and our results indicate strong
   correlation between citizen scientist and researcher data suggesting
   with intensive training and engagement, accurate data collection by
   citizen scientists and volunteer retention is possible. We suggest that
   citizen science can be a plausible option for bee monitoring at the
   level of morphospecies, but success will depend on the extent of
   volunteer engagement and training. Detailed taxonomic analyses may be
   necessary to formulate long term conservation planning for a location.

   belonging to 52 plant taxa identified and pollen grains of woody taxa
   consist of 93.30\% of the annual pollen index, which found concordant
   and evaluated as a reflection of the dominated flora and vegetation of
   the area. Pollen types belonging to Pinus, Quercus,
   Cupressaceae/Taxaceae, Cedrus, Poaceae, Plantago and Abies were
   classified as dominant pollen types for the region and the total amount
   for them were 94.37\% of annual pollen index. Of these, 59.87\% of
   dominated pollen types belonging to Pinaceae family members and can be
   shown as a reason for high yellow rain in the study area. It was noted
   that Gymnosperm trees such as Pinus, Cupressaceae/ Taxaceae, Cedrus and
   also Quercus, which produce excessive amounts of pollen were
   particularly affected by rainfall and humidity in their pollination
   period. The month, in which pollen was the highest in the year, was
   recorded as April in both sampling years. April-May term found as an
   overlap of pollination periods and can be thought as a risky period for

Abstract = {{The color and patterns of animal-pollinated flowers are known to have
   effects on pollinator attraction. In this study, the relative importance
   of flower color and color contrast patterns on pollinator attraction was
   examined in two pollinator groups, swallowtail butterflies and hawkmoths
   using two Hemerocallis species; butterfly-pollinated H. fulva and
   hawkmoth-pollinated H. citrina, having reddish and yellowish flowers in
   human vision, respectively. Flowers of both species have UV bullseye
   patterns, composed of UV-absorbing centers and UV-reflecting
   peripheries, known to function as a typical nectar guide, but UV
   reflectance was significantly more intense in the peripheries of H.
   citrina flowers than in those of H. fulva flowers. Comparison based on
   the visual systems of butterflies and hawkmoths showed that the color
   contrast of the bullseye pattern in H. citrina was more intense than
   that in H. fulva. To evaluate the relative importance of flower color
   and the color contrast of bullseye pattern on pollinator attraction, we
   performed a series of observations using experimental arrays consisting
   of Hemerocallis species and their hybrids. As a result, swallowtail
   butterflies and crepuscular/nocturnal hawkmoths showed contrasting
   preferences for flower color and patterns: butterflies preferred H.
   fulva-like colored flower whereas the preference of hawkmoths was
   affected by the color contrast of the bullseye pattern rather than
   flower color. Both crepuscular and nocturnal hawkmoths consistently
   preferred flowers with stronger contrast of the UV bullseye pattern,
   whereas the preference of hawkmoths for flower color was incoherent. Our
   finding suggests that hawkmoths can use UV-absorbing/reflecting bullseye
   patterns for foraging under light-limited environments and that the
   intensified bullseye contrast of H. citrina evolved as an adaptation to
   hawkmoths. Our results also showed the difference of visual systems
   between pollinators, which may have promoted floral divergence.}},

Abstract = {{Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) serve as important infochemicals,
   mediating several ecological interactions including herbivory and
   pollination. Atmospheric pollutants including traffic-related air
   pollution may impair the detection of VOCs used by insects in
   insect-plant interactions. We investigated the indirect effect of petrol
   exhaust pollution on olfactory learning and memory (short and long term)
   in honey bees. Using appetitive olfactory conditioning, we trained bees
   to learn one of four floral VOC profiles; linalool, dipentene, myrcene
   and geranium. VOCs were unpolluted or polluted with exhaust collected
   from a petrol generator. Exhaust emissions included concentrations of CO
   (246.07 + 17 ppm), NO (20.50 + 6.90 ppb) and NO2 (20.93 + 0.05 ppb)
   consistent with those typically encountered in urban areas and near
   roads. Once bees had learnt the training VOC, we tested whether they
   could recognise that VOC 1 h, 24 h and 48 h post-training. Bees took
   significantly longer to learn polluted VOCs and forgot them faster than
   unpolluted ones. We also tested the `masking' potential of pollution on
   floral VOCs. Using gas chromatography mass spectroscopy we noted
   differences in the chemical profile of polluted versus unpolluted VOCs
   and tested whether bees could recognise polluted VOCs if trained using
   unpolluted ones. For several VOCs tested, bees could distinguish between
   polluted and unpolluted VOCs. Ultimately, our results show that air
   pollution changes the recognition and retention of floral VOCs by bees
   which may consequently impact foraging efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Urban expansion is an increasing threat to biodiversity, especially in
   tropical Africa where biodiversity hot spots are being encroached upon
   by fast-growing cities. Threatened species include bees and other
   pollinators, which deliver important ecosystem services but are
   sensitive to land use changes. We investigated the impact of
   urbanisation and vegetation management practices on pollinator
   abundance, bee diversity, and bee functional traits. We sampled 126
   locations in a stratified random design across an urbanisation gradient
   in two medium-sized cities in the West African Forests biodiversity hot
   spot, encompassing three management practices (farmed sites; amenity
   lands, i.e. green spaces managed for aesthetics; informal green spaces),
   and tested their effect with generalised linear models. Urbanisation did
   not affect bee abundances or diversity but had a negative impact on both
   wasp and beetle abundances. There was also a management-mediated impact
   of urbanisation on bee abundances, which decreased with urbanisation on
   farmed sites but not amenity land or informal green spaces. Management
   practices alone influenced bee abundances with farms harbouring fewer
   bees, and amenity lands fewer beetles. Bee genera occurrence and
   dominance patterns were influenced by both urbanisation and management,
   with some otherwise common genera rare in urban areas. Most functional
   traits were influenced by management, with fewer polylectic bees,
   cavity-nesting bees and long-tongued bees in farmed sites. Amenity lands
   hosted smaller bees and fewer savanna specialists. Some traits were
   influenced by urbanisation, with more long-tongued bees and
   cavity-nesting bees found in urban areas. Synthesis and applications.
   Pollinator responses to urbanisation are complex. In our research, we
   demonstrate how bee, lepidopteran, and non-fruit fly abundances have
   been maintained across an urbanisation gradient in tropical Africa, but
   not wasp and beetle abundances. Moreover, bee community composition and
   the distribution of traits shifted markedly. How green spaces were
   managed was also critical. We found that farmed sites hosted the lowest
   bee abundances and amenity lands the fewest beetles. Retaining informal
   green spaces and amenity lands in African cities, including protecting
   nesting sites for stingless bees, and limiting pesticide application
   would be important for conserving bees and the pollination service they
   provide to both crops and native vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{The pyrethroid deltamethrin and the organophosphate insecticide
   dimethoate are widely used in agriculture and in urban areas. Both plant
   protection products (PPPs) unintendedly result in adverse effects in
   pollinators. Currently, the sublethal effects of both compounds are
   poorly known, particularly on the molecular and biochemical level. Here
   we analysed effects of deltamethrin and dimethoate at environmental and
   sublethal concentrations in honey bee workers by focusing on
   transcriptional changes of target genes in the brain. In addition,
   expression of vitellogenin protein and activity of acetylcholinesterase
   were assessed upon dimethoate exposure to assess physiological effects.
   Deltamethrin resulted in induction of the cyp9q2 transcript at 0.53
   ng/bee, while dimethoate led to induction of vitellogenin on the mRNA
   and protein level at 2 ng/bee. Transcripts of additional cytochrome
   P450-dependent mono-oxygenases (cyps) and genes related to immune system
   regulation were not differentially expressed upon PPP exposure.
   Dimethoate but not deltamethrin led to a strong and
   concentration-related inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase at 2 and 20
   ng/bee. Our data demonstrate that deltamethrin and dimethoate exhibit
   transcriptional effects at environmental concentrations in the brain of
   honey bees. Dimethoate also strongly affected physiological traits,
   which may translate to adverse effects in forager bees. (C) 2018

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Urban and suburban landscapes can be refuges for biodiversity of bees
   and other pollinators. Public awareness of declining pollinator
   populations has increased interest in growing plants that provide floral
   resources for bees. Various publications and websites list
   ``bee-friendly{''} plants, but such lists are rarely based on empirical
   data, nor do they emphasize flowering trees and shrubs, which are a
   major component of urban landscapes. We quantified bee visitation to 72
   species of flowering woody landscape plants across 373 urban and
   suburban sites in Kentucky and southern Ohio, USA, sampling and
   identifying the bee assemblages associated with 45 of the most
   bee-attractive species. We found strong plant species effects and
   variation in seasonal activity of particular bee taxa, but no overall
   differences in extent of bee visitation or bee genus diversity between
   native and non-native species, trees and shrubs, or early-, mid-, and
   late-season blooming plants. Horticulturally-modified varieties of
   Hydrangea, Prunus, and Rosa with double petals or clusters of showy
   sterile sepals attracted few bees compared to related plants with more
   accessible floral rewards. Some of the non-native woody plant species
   bloomed when floral resources from native plants were scarce and were
   highly bee-attractive, so their use in landscapes could help extend the
   flowering season for bees. These data will help city foresters,
   landscape managers, and the public make informed decisions to create
   bee-friendly urban and suburban landscapes.}},

Title = {{Asclepias Syriaca (Common Milkweed) flowering date shift in response to
   climate change}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{The consequences of altered flowering dates due to climate change can be
   severe, especially for plants that rely on coordinated flower and
   pollinator emergence for reproduction. The plant Asclepias syriaca
   (Common Milkweed) relies on pollinators for movement of its pollen and
   evidence suggests that it has recently been declining. Given these
   factors and this plant's importance as a host species for the declining
   Danaus plexippus (Monarch Butterfly), it is critical to determine if its
   flowering is being modified by climate change. As a first step to
   answering this question I quantified the relationship between climate
   and flowering date for A. syriaca using data from the USA National
   Phenology Network repository and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration. I found that temperatures were higher than they had been
   historically (1895-2010) and mean flowering dates occurred earlier with
   higher temperatures. Additionally, there is a significant negative
   interactive effect of temperature and year on flowering date indicating
   that from 2011 through 2016 higher temperatures are correlated with
   increasingly earlier flowering dates. The change in flowering appears to
   be symmetrical in regards to the flowering time distribution, in that
   along with the mean, both maximum and minimum flowering dates are
   occurring earlier, as well. There is no evidence that earlier flowering
   is due to earlier initial growth or results in later fruit ripening.
   Consequences of this shift in flowering can only be speculated upon at
   this point, but due to the ecological importance of A. syriaca and its
   susceptibility to phenological mismatch, they should be considered when
   developing conservation plans for A. syriaca and the organisms for which
   it is a host.}},

Abstract = {{Mammal-plant interactions differ significantly between urban and natural
   environments; however, knowledge of mammal-pollinated plants in urban
   areas remains limited compared to plants in their natural habitats.
   Here, we compared the flower visitors of Mucuna macrocarpa between urban
   and forested areas in Okinawa-jima Island, Japan and in Taiwan. Mucuna
   macrocarpa requires a highly specialized pollination process. Our study
   showed that Ryukyu flying foxes (Pteropus dasymallus) were the
   pollinator of M. macrocarpa in both the urban and forested areas of
   Okinawa-jima Island, whereas, in Taiwan, red-bellied squirrels
   (Callosciurus erythraeus) were the main pollinator species. Both
   pollinator species visited inflorescences in urban areas at the same or
   higher frequency as in forested areas. In contrast, non-pollinating
   animals engaged in nectar-robbing or picking-off behaviors when visiting
   Mucuna flowers in forested areas only. These results suggest that M.
   macrocarpa successfully attracts local pollinators, even in urban
   environments that have relatively low biodiversity. The negative effect
   of animal guilds on the success of M. macrocarpa pollination is
   significantly lower in urban compared to forested areas. However, the
   fragmentation caused by urbanization might reduce the opportunity for
   cross-pollination.}},

Title = {{Surviving in the absence of flowers: do nectar yeasts rely on

Journal = {{FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Floral nectar represents an ephemeral habitat that is restricted in time
   and space to zoophilous flowering vegetation. To survive in these
   habitats, nectar-inhabiting microorganisms rely on animal vectors to
   disperse from one flower to the next. However, it remains unclear how
   nectar yeasts persist when flowers and nectar cease to be present. Here,
   we tested the hypothesis that hibernating bumblebee queens function as a
   reservoir for nectar yeasts in the absence of plants or pollinators
   during winter. Our results show that the nectar yeast, Metschnikowia
   reukaufii, was present in the gastrointestinal tract of wild bumblebee
   queens that emerged from hibernation and that it could persist inside
   the gut of hibernating queens under experimental conditions. However, no
   evidence for such persistence was found in the case of the second most
   frequent nectar yeast, M. gruessii. Furthermore, a phylloplane yeast
   that occasionally inhabits nectar, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, was able to
   colonize the gut under experimental conditions. Two bumblebee-associated
   yeasts, Candida bombi and C. bombiphila, were successfully passed down
   generations after administration in commercial lab-reared bumblebees.
   Overall, these results demonstrate that bumblebees could act as a
   reservoir for nectar yeasts during winter when floral nectar is absent.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding spatial variation in the structure and stability of
   plant-pollinator networks, and their relationship with anthropogenic
   drivers, is key for maintaining pollination services and mitigating
   declines. Constructing sufficient networks to examine patterns over
   large spatial scales remains challenging. Using biological records
   (citizen science), we constructed potential plant-pollinator networks at
   10 km resolution across Great Britain, comprising all potential
   interactions inferred from recorded floral visitation and species
   co-occurrence. We calculated network metrics (species richness,
   connectance, pollinator and plant generality) and adapted existing
   methods to assess robustness to sequences of simulated plant extinctions
   across multiple networks. We found positive relationships between
   agricultural land cover and both pollinator generality and robustness to
   extinctions under several extinction scenarios. Increased robustness was
   attributable to changes in plant community composition (fewer
   extinction-prone species) and network structure (increased pollinator
   generality). Thus, traits enabling persistence in highly agricultural
   landscapes can confer robustness to potential future perturbations on
   plant-pollinator networks.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the most important ecological functional area in China, the
   Hengduan Mountain region has experienced dramatic land use/land cover
   changes (LUCC) over the past 20 years, but the effects of these changes
   on ecosystem services remain unknown. We revised a proxy-based method to
   analyze LUCC and ecosystem service value (ESVs) dynamics over three
   decades, and evaluated the sensitivity of ESVs to LUCC by using an
   elasticity indicator. Forest land converted to grassland during
   1990-2000 was due to deforestation, but a reverse trend was found in
   2000-2010 as a result of the implementation of ecological projects. The
   ESVs of the entire region decreased slightly (0.01\% per year) in
   1990-2000, and sharply increased (0.14\% per year) in 2000-2010. The
   elasticity reached 0.07 for 1990-2000 and 0.29 for 2000-2010, which were
   moderate levels for China. For the whole region, forest land is a key
   land use type and should be maintained. Along the elevation gradient,
   different developmental strategies should be adopted. Lower areas should
   focus on the coordinated development of economy and ecology, and higher
   areas on ecological protection. On the county level, it is necessary to
   adjust the forest-grassland proportion in each county.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Land use change reorganizes local communities, resulting in complex
   changes in biodiversity at larger scales. The biotic homogenization
   hypothesis predicts that the replacement of sensitive loser species with
   widespread winner species will lead to loss of beta diversity and
   ultimately loss of regional diversity at multiple levels of ecological
   organization. We ask if land use is associated with biotic
   homogenization patterns in bee communities at two large spatial scales,
   using both species and phylogenetic dissimilarity indices. Location Time
   period North-eastern USA (New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania).
   2013-2015. Major taxa studied Methods Superfamily Apoidea (bees). We
   sampled bee communities from replicated sites in forest, agriculture and
   urban land use types within a large spatial extent spanning four
   distinct ecoregions. We compared pairwise compositional dissimilarity
   within and between ecoregions, using both species and phylogenetic
   dissimilarity indices. We also investigated how compositional difference
   is related to geographic distance between sites. Results Main
   conclusions Forested, agricultural and urban landscapes did not differ
   detectably in either mean pairwise species dissimilarity or slope of
   distance-decay. Dissimilarity among both agricultural and urban bee
   communities increased with geographic distance. However, urban
   landscapes had significantly lower phylogenetic pairwise dissimilarity,
   indicating strong phylogenetic homogenization at within- and
   between-ecoregion scales. We did not detect bee species homogenization
   in agricultural or urban land use types. However, urban land use was
   associated with phylogenetic homogenization across a large regional
   extent. Urban bee communities are dominated by closely related species
   that maintain beta diversity at the species level, but contribute to low
   phylogenetic beta diversity relative to forest and agricultural bee
   communities. We observed similar levels of homogenization at landscape
   and regional spatial extents, despite inter-site distances differing by
   an order of magnitude between these scales. Further urbanization could
   result in loss of bee biodiversity and evolutionary history at multiple
   spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{We present novel dynamic mixture models for the monitoring of bumblebee
   populations on an unprecedented geographical scale, motivated by the UK
   citizen science scheme BeeWalk. The models allow us for the first time
   to estimate bumblebee phenology and within-season productivity, defined
   as the number of individuals in each caste per colony in the population
   in that year, from citizen science data. All of these parameters are
   estimated separately for each caste, giving a means of considerable
   ecological detail in examining temporal changes in the complex life
   cycle of a social insect in the wild. Due to the dynamic nature of the
   models, we are able to produce population trends for a number of UK
   bumblebee species using the available time-series. Via an additional
   simulation exercise, we show the extent to which useful information will
   increase if the survey continues, and expands in scale, as expected.
   Bumblebees are extraordinarily important components of the ecosystem,
   providing pollination services of vast economic impact and functioning
   as indicator species for changes in climate or land use. Our results
   demonstrate the changes in both phenology and productivity between years
   and provide an invaluable tool for monitoring bumblebee populations,
   many of which are in decline, in the UK and around the world.

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence of the benefits of introducing urban
   meadows as an alternative to amenity mown grass in public greenspaces,
   both for biodiversity, and human wellbeing. Developing a better
   understanding of the meadow characteristics driving human and wildlife
   response is therefore critical. We addressed this by assessing public
   and invertebrate response to eight different annual meadow mixes defined
   by two levels of plant species diversity and two levels of colour
   diversity, sown in an urban park in Luton, UK, in April 2015. On-site
   questionnaires with the visiting public were conducted in July, August
   and September 2015. Invertebrate responses were assessed via
   contemporaneous visual surveys and one sweep net survey (August 2015).
   Flower colour diversity had effects on human aesthetic response and the
   response of pollinators such as bumblebees and hoverflies. Plant species
   diversity, however, was not a driver of human response with evidence
   that people used colour diversity as a cue to assessing species
   diversity. Plant species diversity did affect some invertebrates, with
   higher abundances of certain taxa in low species diversity meadows. Our
   findings indicate that if the priority for sown meadows is to maximise
   human aesthetic enjoyment and the abundance and diversity of observable
   invertebrates, particularly pollinators, managers of urban green
   infrastructure should prioritise high flower colour diversity mixes over
   those of high plant species diversity. Incorporating late-flowering
   non-native species such as Coreopsis tinctoria (plains coreopsis) can
   prolong the attractiveness of the meadows for people and availability of
   resources for pollinators and would therefore be beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{In the species of the Cucurbitaceae family, the occurrence of separate
   male and female flowers in the same plant (monoecy) is controlled by an
   ethylene biosynthesis ACS gene, which specifically suppresses the
   development of stamen in the female flower. In watermelon, a mutation of
   loss of function in CitACS4 promotes the conversion of female into
   hermaphrodite flowers, and of monoecious into andromonoecious plants. We
   have studied whether the ethylene produced by CitACS4 enzyme could also
   be involved in other ethylene-regulated traits, including pistillate
   flowering transition and the number of female flowers per plant, the
   development of floral organs other than stamens, as well as fruit and
   seed set, and fruit development. A linkage analysis approach was
   performed in three independent F2 populations segregating for the two
   alleles of the gene (M, monoecious; m, andromonoecious), and the
   different traits under study. The CitACS4m allele not only cosegregated
   with andromonoecy, but also with earlier pistillate transition, an
   increased number of pistillate flowers per plant, and a slower growth
   and maturation of petals and carpels, which delayed anthesis time in
   hermaphrodite flowers. The m allele was also found to be linked to a
   reduced fruit set, which was not caused by a deficiency in pollination
   or fertilization. The gene also affected the longitudinal and transverse
   growth rates of the ovary and fruit, which means that fruits from
   andromonoecious plants (mm) were rounder than those from monoecious (MM)
   ones. Taken together, these data indicate that the locus defined by the
   ethylene biosynthesis and sex-determining gene CitACS4 acts as a
   pleiotropic regulator of the complete development of the pistillate
   flower and the earlier development of the fruit.}},

Abstract = {{In urban and suburban ecosystems, biodiversity can depend on various
   non-native plant species, including crop plants, garden plants and
   weeds. Non-native plants may help to maintain biodiversity by providing
   a source of forage for pollinators in these ecosystems. However, the
   contribution of plants in urban and agricultural areas to ecosystem
   services has often been underestimated in biodiversity assessments. In
   this study, we investigated the pollen sources of native honeybees (Apis
   cerana) in an arboretum containing native trees and urban and
   agricultural plants in a suburban landscape. We surveyed the flowering
   tree species planted inside the arboretum, which were potential pollen
   sources. The number of potential pollen-source species of native trees
   peaked in June and July and decreased after August. We collected A.
   cerana pollen balls every month and identified plant species of pollen
   in the collected pollen balls using DNA barcoding. In total, we
   identified 29 plant species from A. cerana pollen balls. The probability
   of A. cerana using pollen from urban and agricultural plants was higher
   in July and August than in June. A. cerana collected pollen forages from
   native tree species (53\%), but also gathered pollen from crop plants
   (13\%), garden trees (19\%) and native and non-native weeds (14\%); the
   predominant pollen sources in September and October were the garden tree
   Ulmus parvifolia and the non-native weed Solidago altissima. We found
   that native honeybees used plants from a variety of habitats including
   non-native plants to compensate for apparent seasonal shortages of
   native tree sources in suburban ecosystems. Our results highlight the
   importance of assessments of both positive and negative roles of
   non-native plants in urbanized ecosystems to improve biodiversity
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{In the United States, residential yards are typically overlooked for
   biodiversity conservation, yet they account for a significant portion of
   urban green space. Yard vegetation can serve as valuable habitat patches
   for insect pollinator populations in cities, providing important
   foraging and nesting resources. Based on long-term native bee sampling
   data, we investigate the social and cultural drivers shaping front yard
   vegetation composition and configuration at two study sites with
   consistently low native bee species diversity and abundance. We employ
   quantitative remote sensing approaches with analysis of qualitative
   interview data to examine residential vegetation patterns and analyze
   the socio-cultural relationships between people and vegetation. Data
   analyses reveal both study sites have lower levels of vegetation
   composition and complexity, resulting in reduced habitat resources. We
   find neighborhood public-facing landscaping is shaped by various
   socio-cultural influences: aesthetics, norms, reference-group behavior,
   institutions, socioeconomics, and identity. Front yard land-use and
   decision-making practices are particularly meaning laden, as these
   spaces are often perceived as visible representations of longstanding
   neighborhood identity and contiguous common areas to be managed to a
   perfect lawn ideal. The quantitative and qualitative data are used to
   characterize the two study sites and inform future urban conservation
   and development efforts salient to citizen stakeholders.}},

Journal = {{URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{42-49}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Urbanization has negative effects on plant-animal interactions by
   reducing plant richness and increasing resource limitations. However, it
   is possible to replant these areas, and plant species can be selected
   based on the resources they provide, as well as their relationships with
   animals. I observed several trees of Ceiba pubiflora (Malvaceae,
   Bombacoideae) to identify the bird species interacting with their
   flowers in an urban area. This plant may be especially important, as it
   blossoms during the dry season, when the overall flower availability in
   the study area is low. It may also be important during a short period of
   decline in the fleshy fruit supply. Even though C. pubiflora was growing
   in the city and had a low volume of nectar accumulating in its flowers
   (mean of 1.73 mu l; SD = 1.39 mu l), it attracted a variety of birds (25
   species belonging to six families), some of which are usually regarded
   as forest dependent. Nectarivorous birds from the family Trochilidae
   (hummingbirds, n = 12 species) had the highest percentage of visits
   (64.08\%), especially during periods of relatively high nectar sugar
   concentration and calorie availability (c. 18\% and 1.5 cal.,
   respectively). Hummingbirds primarily acted as nectar thieves but also
   sometimes as potential flower pollinators. In contrast, several
   nonnectarivorous birds (frugivore-granivores, frugivore-insectivores and
   omnivores) acted only as nectar robbers or flower predators. Ceiba
   pubiflora flowers appear to be an important source of energy for birds
   in the urban area. The data of this study show that C. pubiflora has
   utility as management tool to promote and conserve biodiversity in
   cities.}},

   While the commuter bike path and perimeter fence were considered

Title = {{Along urbanization sprawl, exotic plants distort native bee
   (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) assemblages in high elevation Andes ecosystem}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Native bees contribute a considerable portion of pollination services
   for endemic as well as introduced plant species. Their decline has been
   attributed to several human-derived influences including global warming
   as well as the reduction, alteration, and loss of bee's habitat. With
   human expansion comes along the introduction of exotic plant species
   with negative impacts over native ecosystems. Anthropic effects may even
   have a deeper impact on communities adapted to extreme environments,
   such as high elevation habitats, where abiotic stressors alone are a
   natural limitation to biodiversity. Among these effects, the
   introduction of exotic plants and urbanization may have a greater
   influence on native communities. In this work, we explored such
   problems, studying the relationship between the landscape and its effect
   over richness and abundance of native bees from the subandean belt in
   the Andes mountain chain. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of
   exotic plant abundance on this high-altitude bee assemblage. Despite the
   landscape not showing an effect over bee richness and abundance, exotic
   plants did have a significant influence over the native bee assemblage.
   The abundance of exotic plants was associated with a relative increase
   in the proportion of small and medium bee species. Moreover, Halictidae
   was the only family that appeared to be favored by an increase in the
   abundance of exotic plant species. We discuss these results and the
   urgent need for further research of high-altitude environments due to
   their vulnerability and high endemicity.}},

Abstract = {{Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) in West African countries is
   developing rapidly in response to population growth and changing
   consumer preferences. Furthermore, UPA offers opportunities to secure
   income and social integration for the urban poor. However, little is
   known about household (HH) income security effects of the ongoing shift
   in UPA land use from crops that do not rely on insect pollinators for
   fruit development (e.g., sorghum and millet) to pollinator-dependent
   crops. In our study we developed a Household Vulnerability Index (HVI)
   for 224 HHs along a rural-urban gradient of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
   The HVI indicates to which degree total HH revenue could be affected by
   a decline in insect pollinators. HH specific relative reduction of
   agricultural revenue ranged from 0 to -0.83, a reduction in HHs' revenue
   of up to 83\%, depending on the crops' level of pollinator dependency.
   Half of the studied HHs (n = 108) showed an HVI of 0 and remained
   unaffected by a decline in pollinators. Nevertheless, mean HVI was
   highest for urban HHs; making these HHs most vulnerable for loss of
   pollination services. As in urban areas changes in insect-mediated
   pollination services are expected, the development of resilient UPA
   systems must consider ``pollinator-friendly{''} landscape management.}},

Abstract = {{Airborne pollen distribution in Mardin city was measured volumetrically
   during three consecutive years, 2014-2016. Three thousand eight hundred
   fifty-seven pollen grains as a mean value belonging to 44 taxa were
   recorded annually during the study period, and pollen grains from woody
   plant taxa had the more substantial atmospheric contribution with
   62.66\% and with 23 taxa. Despite the differences between years, the
   highest pollen concentration was recorded in April. The main pollen
   producers of the pollen spectrum were Cupressaceae (27.79\%), Poaceae
   (21.21\%), Platanus (10.29\%), Morus (6.19\%), Olea europaea (5.01\%),
   Quercus (4.91\%), Pinus (3.84\%), and Amaranthaceae (3.73\%) and almost
   all dominant pollen types in the city atmosphere were previously stated
   to be allergic. The atmospheric sampling data was characterized by the
   high presence of woody plants in spring, as well as the high
   presentation of herbaceous plants in late spring to early winter. The
   main pollen season (MPS) and durations of dominated pollen types were
   analyzed and mostly found a little bit earlier or parallel with similar
   studies in Mediterranean basin, but found earlier than the east.
   Statistical analyses were performed to compare years with each other and
   for correlating daily pollen concentrations of dominated pollen types
   concurrent with the data of meteorological parameters; a number of
   significant correlations were found.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The self-incompatible flowers of Linaria vulgaris have developed a range
   of mechanisms for attraction of insect visitors/pollinators and
   deterrence of ineffective pollinators and herbivores. These adaptive
   traits include the flower size and symmetry, the presence of a spur as a
   secondary nectar presenter, olfactory (secondary metabolites) and
   sensual (scent, flower color, nectar guidecontrasting palate) signals,
   and floral rewards, i.e. pollen and nectar. Histochemical tests revealed
   that the floral glandular trichomes produced essential oils and
   flavonoids, and pollen grains contained flavonoids, terpenoids, and
   steroids, which play a role of olfactory attractants/repellents. The
   nectary gland is disc-shaped and located at the base of the ovary.
   Nectar is secreted through numerous modified stomata. Nectar secretion
   began in the bud stage and lasted to the end of anthesis. The amount of
   produced nectar depended on the flower age and ranged from 0.21 to
   3.95mg/flower (mean=1.51mg). The concentration of sugars in the nectar
   reached up to 57.0\%. Both the nectar amount and sugar concentration
   demonstrated a significant year and population effect. Pollen production
   was variable between the years of the study. On average, a single flower
   of L. vulgaris produced 0.31mg of pollen. The spectrum of insect
   visitors in the flowers of L. vulgaris differed significantly between
   populations. In the urban site, Bombus terrestris and Apis mellifera
   were the most common visitors, while a considerable number of visits of
   wasps and syrphid flies were noted in the rural site.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{23-38}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Bee communities were studied with three different conditions of
   land-use: 1) urban area; 2) crops and livestock; and, 3) preserved
   vegetation. All three conditions have elements of tropical dry forest
   and arc in the ``Sierra de Quila{''} Flora and Fauna Protection Area and
   its influence zone. Sampling was carried out throughout the year (three
   days per month) for each land-use condition. Bee species and their
   abundance were registered with the intention of knowing how changes in
   the vegetation are related to bee community structure (richness,
   abundance, and alpha and beta diversity).
   A total of 14,054 individuals from 160 species were registered. A
   rarefaction analysis, showed that the preserved areas had significantly
   greater richness and diversity. Beta diversity analysis revealed a
   species turnover of nearly 32\% among each pair of conditions. It is
   concluded that the changes in land-use negatively affect richness and
   diversity and causes major changes in species composition of the bee
   community. For this reason, it is recommended that the protection of the
   tropical dry forest, both for this study area but also in general for
   Mexico, is essential to guarantee the conservation of this group of
   insects, which are required for the reproduction of a great number wild
   and cultivated plant specie.}},

Title = {{Production from both wild harvest and cultivation: The cross-border
   Swertia chirayita (Gentianaceae) trade}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{225}},
Pages = {{42-52}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Swertia chirayita is the most widely
   traded species in a genus of 150 species, many of which are used in
   traditional medicine. S. chirayita is used mainly in Ayurvedic and
   Tibetan systems of medicine and the homoeopathic system of medicine as
   well as in regional folk medicine. Primarily wild collected, with some
   cultivation. S. chirayita is traded as a medicinal substance and
   exported in the forms of dried whole plant or extract of whole plant
   individually and/or as active ingredients of Ayurvedic medicines. S.
   chirayita export valuations continue to make S. chirayita one of Nepal's
   highest foreign exchange earning medicinal plant species.
   Aims of the review: The aims of this review were first, to assess the
   scale of the global trade in S. chirayita, second, to review evidence
   from plant population biology and from studies on the impacts of wild
   harvest on S. chirayita populations and cultivation as an alternative
   source of supply.
   Methods: The taxonomy and trade names for S. chirayita were reviewed,
   followed by a synthesis of published information on Swertia population
   biology and studies on impacts of wild S. chirayita harvest from across
   the geographic range of this species. Data on the prices paid for S.
   chirayita were then compiled for the period 2001-2017, followed by an
   analysis of global trade data for S. chirayita.
   Results and conclusions: Based on India import data and assuming an
   estimate in an earlier study that 60\% of Nepal's S. chirayita
   production goes to India and 35\% to Tibet, then Nepal's 2013 annual
   production was about 711 metric tonnes (MT) of which about 675.6 MT
   would be exported (India + Tibet). Nepal's 2014 annual production would
   be an estimated 503.25 MT of which about 478 MT would be exported.
   Declines in S. chirayita populations have been widely noted across its
   range. In India, since 2004, a ban was placed on the export of wild
   harvested S. chirayita by the Government of India, where the Director
   General of Foreign Trade prohibited export of S. chirayita plants, plant
   portions and their derivatives and extracts obtained from the wild with
   the exception of `formulations'. Cultivation of S. chirayita to meet
   commercial demand has been an important part of a solution to
   over-exploitation of wild stocks in eastern Nepal for 25 years,
   producing significant quantities that enter the export trade to India
   and Tibet. In Sankhuwasabha district, for example, 53.1 MT of S.
   chirayita were produced in 2013/014, just over half of which (27 MT)
   were exported to India, with the remainder exported to Tibet. Based on
   value-chain analysis and cost-benefit assessments, S. chirayita
   cultivation has been shown to be profitable in Nepal. However, since the
   first cost-benefit assessment was done (2013), prices dropped from
   NRs750/kg in April 2013 to a low of 250 NRs/kg in December 2017). Taking
   inflation into account further highlights the steep decline in the
   profitability for local farmers, who have limited options for
   value-adding. Consequently, farmers prefer to grow more profitable
   alternative crops, such as Nepal cardamom (Amomum subulatwn Roxb.).}},

Abstract = {{In 2009 the USDA-NRCS asked the Urban Bee Lab at the University of
   California, Berkeley if urban bee-flower knowledge could be used to
   attract native bees to farms in Brentwood, Contra Costa Co. in Northern
   California. The overarching question was, could native bees play a role
   in supplementing honey bees by providing pollination services for crop
   flowers? If so, how many native bee species were visiting farms and how
   frequently did they occur?
   Eight small farms (4-60 ha) were selected to investigate this question;
   four were control and four were treatment farms where bee habitat
   gardens were constructed. Habitat gardens were stocked with native and
   non-native ornamental plants known to attract native bees (and honey
   bees).
   Bees were monitored yearly in spring at each farm from 2010-2016 to
   evaluate species richness and abundance, which yielded several findings:
   I. Farms near urban areas and a creek were consistently more attractive
   to diverse and abundant bee species
   II. Inconsistent bee garden maintenance and major changes in farm
   operations in other farms resulted in consistently lower measurements of
   bee richness and abundance
   III. Over the seven-year monitoring period, 144 bee species were
   recorded among all farms
   IV. Nearby urban areas had most of the same species as the agricultural
   areas, suggesting a relationship of bees moving between two areas
   V. A total of 23 diverse native bee species were recorded from apple,
   berry, and cherry flowers, and many of them in substantial numbers,
   indicating that native bees were providing pollination services
   Finally, maintaining frequent professional contact with growers was
   considered crucial in conducting research over the long term. These
   contacts were also critical in designing outreach packages to growers
   who expressed interest in applying our native bee findings to their
   farming operations.}},

Abstract = {{University campuses often contain contiguous areas of urban green space
   (UGS) which are otherwise scarce in large cities and, thus, may provide
   critical habitat for numerous species. In this study, we evaluate
   butterfly and plant diversity at Chiba University in Japan from five UGS
   types, including intensive green roofs, meadows, roadsides, open spaces.
   and community gardens. Surveying non-destructively every two weeks from
   June to November 2010, we identified 707 individual butterflies to 25
   species from five families, including red-listed species (e.g. Parantica
   sita Kollar, 1844). However, one species, Pseudozizeeria maha Kollar,
   1848, represented over 50\% of all individuals surveyed. Butterflies in
   the family Papilionidae showed strong preference for roadside habitat,
   indicating the importance of `butterfly flyways' and contiguous habitat
   corridors on University campuses. Butterfly richness and abundance was
   significantly different between UGS types and highest in the community
   garden and roadsides. We recorded 70 garden plant species and 117
   spontaneous plant species (which grew opportunistically, without design
   input), of which 58\% were native. Total plant richness was positively
   correlated with butterfly species richness, and non-native spontaneous
   plant species richness was positively correlated with butterfly
   richness, abundance, diversity, and evenness. Additionally, 76\% of the
   spontaneous species identified were determined to be used by butterflies
   as larval hosts or for adult feeding. Identification of spontaneous
   plant species and use of selective weeding should be included in
   landscape management planning on campuses to promote butterflies, which
   can act as ambassadors for biodiversity conservation and help connect
   people to nature.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Native plants are becoming widely used in built landscapes to help
   mitigate the loss of biodiversity caused by urbanization. The primary
   advantage of native plant species over introduced ornamentals is their
   ability to support the development of the insects that fuel vertebrate
   food webs as well as specialist pollinators. The horticultural industry
   has introduced many cultivars of native plants to improve their
   aesthetic value and disease resistance, but there has been little work
   that measures the impact of these genetic changes on insect herbivores
   and pollinators. Here we measure how six desirable traits in native
   woody plant cultivars (leaf color, variegation, fall color, habit,
   disease resistance, and fruit size) compare with their wild types in
   terms of their ability to support insect herbivore development,
   abundance, and species richness. Using a common garden experiment, we
   quantified the abundance and diversity of insect herbivores using each
   species and its cultivars for growth and development over a 2-year
   period, as well as cumulative feed damage over the entire season. We
   also conducted feeding tests with evergreen bagworm (Thyridopteryx
   ephemeraeformis) to measure the preference of hatchling caterpillars for
   cultivars vs. straight species. We found that cultivars that had leaves
   altered from green to red, blue, or purple deterred insect feeding in
   all three experiments, a preference for variegated cultivars in one of
   our three experiments, but no consistent pattern of use among the
   species and cultivars chosen for other traits. These results suggest
   that the usefulness of native cultivars in restoring insect-driven food
   webs depends on the cultivar trait that has been selected.}},

Abstract = {{Urban ecosystems are growing rapidly and urbanization is an important
   cause of the loss of biodiversity. Bees are declining in abundance
   worldwide, including urban areas, and this decline is alarming because
   of their global importance as plant pollinators. Here we examine that
   decline by comparing a bee assemblage sampled in the 1980s and again in
   2015, in an urban area of the city of Curitiba. Both studies sampled
   assemblages with hand-nets every two weeks during one year of study. Bee
   species richness has declined by 45\% (112 species then, 63 today). Two
   species that have disappeared, Gaesischia fulgurans (Holmberg, 1903) and
   Thectochlora basiatra (Strand, 1910), have also disappeared elsewhere in
   the city. Also, relative abundances of species have changed, notably
   with the increase of social bees. Large bees that nest in cavities have
   also increased relative to small bees that nest in the ground. These
   findings are similar with previous reports indicating the sensibility of
   bees to urbanization. The increase in paved areas, in urban population
   and in exotic plants are all probably responsible for the sharp decline
   in bee diversity and abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between flower visiting insects and nectar resp. pollen
   producing plants belong to the most relevant in terrestrial ecosystems.
   Their diversity and dominance relationship are important indicators for
   the stability and functionality of ecosystems and belong to the high
   ranking ecosystem services. Potential pollinators should be strongly
   concerned especially regarding anthropogenic impacts on habitats. We
   studied the diversity and quantities of flower visiting insects with
   special focus on wild bees (Apiformes) in two locations near the city of
   Vienna (Austria). Insect sampling occurred from May until July 2015
   every two weeks parallel to the vegetation surveys incl. records of the
   cover of flowering plants. In each location patches of semi-natural
   grassland as well as flowering strips within vineyards were
   investigated. We found a significant correlation between the number of
   insects or insect taxa (especially for Hymenoptera) and the current
   flower cover. In some cases flowering strips in vineyards harbor higher
   numbers of insects and higher diversity of bee species than the
   semi-natural grassland due to temporarily higher values of flower cover.
   However, grassland patches provide a much more constant supply with
   nectar producing plants replacing each other in their flowering phase
   during the season. In contrast, flowering strips are often dominated by
   one or a few short-lived sown plants, which is of advantage for some
   oligolectic bees specialized on Brassicaceae or Fabaceae. Flowering
   strips within organically farmed vineyards are more similar to
   semi-natural grassland regarding the diversity of flower visiting
   insects than to conventionally farmed vineyards.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Maintaining biodiversity in urban landscapes requires a well-functioning
   green infrastructure for the landscape to remain ecologically
   functional. However, city planners often lack knowledge to identify how
   well different parts of the green infrastructure are connected, and
   tools to estimate the accessibility to important habitats for different
   species in urban areas are strongly needed. We compared the ability of
   three measures of available food resources, with increasing complexity,
   for explaining species richness and abundance of bees and wasps at 23
   locations in an urban landscape in Sweden. Specifically, we tested (1)
   the summed amount of food habitat within a buffer circle, (2) the amount
   of food habitat weighted by distance, and (3) the summed amount of food
   habitat within an area created by cost-weighted distance based on the
   surrounding landscape friction. We tested two spatial scales (200 and
   400 m). The results show that both the summed (1) and the weighted
   measures (2) were very poor in explaining species richness and abundance
   regardless of spatial scale, while we found significant relationships
   for both species richness and abundance with the friction-based measure
   (3) at both scales. For the friction-based measure, the relationships
   with both response variables were strongest at the smallest spatial
   scale (200 m). We conclude that bees and wasps are sensitive to barriers
   such as large roads and built-up areas when foraging in urban
   environments. This is important to consider when assessing the
   functionality of urban green infrastructure in order to not overestimate
   the available amount of habitat and how well different parts of the
   landscape are connected for these important pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Cypresses comprise 160 species with the main ones being Cupressus and
   Hesperocyparis, found around the Mediterranean basin, Juniperus in the
   USA and Cryptomeria in Japan. Atmospheric pollen, levels of which are
   very high in the pollinating season, is highly allergenic and induces
   rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma and chronic cough. Four groups of allergens
   are listed in the WHO/IUIS allergen data bank: group 1, pectate lyase;
   group 2, polygalacturonase; group 3, thaumatin-like protein; group 4,
   calcium-binding protein. In 2010, a small cationic allergen, BP14, was
   described and mainly concerned sensitized patients allergic to cypress
   pollen in south-eastern France. This allergen is clinically relevant and
   belongs to an unusual pollen allergen protein family, the
   snakin/gibberellin-regulated proteins (GRP). Gibberellin is a
   phytohormone that mediates several metabolic pathways in plants,
   including those of biotic and abiotic stress. Snakin/GRP are small
   cationic proteins with antimicrobial properties. Certain allergens
   belonging to this protein family have been described in peach (Pru p 7),
   sweet orange (Cit s 7), Japanese apricot (Pru m 7) and pomegranate (Pun
   g 7). BP14 is cross-reactive with Pru p 7 and Cit s 7. These results
   account for the clinically described associated cypress/peach and
   cypress/citrus syndromes. Further, around 20 more allergens have been
   characterized in the literature. Molecular allergology studies on
   cypress pollen provide an understanding of cross reactions supported by
   clinical data, thus improving the precision of diagnosis and of
   immunotherapeutic management. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Butterflies (Insects: Lepidoptera) contribute to the ecosystem services
   and thereby qualify as a group deserving conservation effort.
   Information on the butterfly-plant links is used as a foundation to
   sustain population and enhance conservation and management. Thus, in the
   present study, the structure of a butterfly-plant network in an urban
   landscape like Kolkata, India, was deciphered highlighting metrics like
   degree distribution, nestedness, and interaction strength and
   specialization index. A total of forty eight butterfly species
   associated with thirty different angiosperm plant species were observed
   during the study period of one year. While Lantana camara was observed
   to be the dominant plant species with 37 links to different butterflies,
   the Catopsilia pyranthe butterfly species was dominant in terms of the
   generalist pattern of links (21 links) with the plants. Differential
   ability of the shrubs and herbs in the sustenance of the butterflies was
   reflected in the network indices using the herbs and the shrubs,
   separately. In urban landscapes with restricted variety of flowering
   plants, an estimate of relative strength of interactions enables
   identification and further use of the concerned species in sustaining
   butterfly populations. In accordance with these propositions, the
   butterfly-plant network illustrated in the present instance may prove
   useful in selection of plant species required for the enhancement of
   population of desired butterfly species in urban areas like Kolkata,
   India.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive systems are recognized as having a profound influence on
   the extent and structure of genetic variation in plant populations. To
   investigate the spatiotemporal variation in the reproductive modes
   (sexual and vegetative reproduction) and population genetic structures
   of a monocarpic perennial herb, Cardiocrinum cordatum (liliaceae), we
   selected a variety of habitats (e.g. large forested area including
   primeval forest, small fragmented secondary forest, and so on) around
   Sapporo City, Japan. We conducted breeding experiments, monitored the
   fate and growth of marked individuals for 3years, and also analyzed the
   spatiotemporal genetic variation of flowering plants within the
   populations using allozyme variation. Plants emasculated prior to
   anthesis produced mature fruits in all populations examined. However,
   seed production was significantly lower in the small fragmented
   populations, possibly because of the low availability of pollinators and
   subsequent pollen limitation. In these fragmented populations, the
   mature flowering plants tended to be more dependent on vegetative
   reproduction for their recruitment, because they can only produce
   flowers once in their lifetime. Genetic diversity using samples from
   mature flowering plants in each population was lower in the small
   fragmented populations than in the large populations. In addition,
   although genotypic compositions in the fragmented populations were more
   or less similar during the 3years of the study, the dominant genotypes
   changed temporally and spatially every year in the large populations.
   The present study demonstrated that the reproductive features of C.
   cordatum can be altered in various environmental conditions, such as
   habitat fragmentation, and these changes considerably affected the
   population genetic structures and vice versa.}},

Title = {{Local and landscape factors affect sunflower pollination in a
   Mediterranean agroecosystem}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{In Europe, the surface devoted to sunflower cultivation has expanded by
   similar to 26\% from 2006 to 2016. Theoretically, this implies an
   increasing demand for pollinators, while at the same time, scientific
   reports claim that pollinator communities worldwide are threatened by
   multiple stressors such as agrochemicals, the loss of suitable habitats
   and habitat fragmentation. However, the question that arises is whether
   insect pollination is still relevant for modern sunflower varieties that
   are often highly self-fertile. Following recent studies which
   demonstrate that surrounding land use composition may affect ecosystem
   service provisioning in cropped fields, this study aims at re-examining
   the pollination status of sunflower while disentangling the effects of
   local and landscape variables on sunflower seed set and oil content in
   Central Italy. Commercial cultivars, regardless of their degree of
   self-fertility, showed increased seed set and oil content when receiving
   adequate amounts of cross-pollination; oil composition, though, was not
   affected by cross-pollination events. Honey bees accounted for the vast
   majority of pollinators ensuring an overall adequate pollination.
   Sunflower seed set was higher in fields surrounded by landscapes
   containing a greater abundance of beehives, early flowering crops, urban
   areas and woody linear elements; conversely, seed set was lower where
   herbaceous semi-natural habitats dominated the surrounding landscape.
   This information is necessary for a science-based planning of
   agricultural policies and shows that, despite the adoption of
   self-fertile cultivars, sunflower still benefits from insect pollination
   and land use planning may affect crop productivity.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE}},

Volume = {{239}},

Abstract = {{Long juvenile phase is one of the major obstacles for breeding of
   seedless citrus with parthenocarpy. Five high to low parthenocarpic and
   monoembryonic Citrus cultivars used as seed parents were crossed with
   moderately parthenocarpic `Foster Pink' grapefruit (FPGF; Citrus
   paradisi Macf.) generating precocious-flowering nucellar seedlings.
   Perfect flowers of precocious-flowering hybrid seedlings derived from
   the crosses were emasculated to prevent pollination and bagged. Those
   that showed ovary growth beyond 14 days after anthesis (DAA) were
   determined to be parthenocarpic. Segregation rates of the parthenocarpic
   to non-parthenocarpic hybrid seedlings were 8:41 for `Akune No.6'
   pummelo x FPGF, 8:26 for `Hirado Suntan' pummelo x FPGF, 9:22 for
   `Iyokan' tangor x FPGF, 109:135 for `Kawachi-bankan' x FPGF, and 13:10
   for `Kiyomi' tangor x FPGF. Considering that about 20.0\% of
   precocious-flowering nucellar seedlings of grapefruit did not set
   parthenocarpic fruits, it is suggested that the parthenocarpy in these
   hybrid seedlings of grapefruit are controlled by three dominant
   complementary genes, P-1, P-2 and P-3. Eleven of 14 adult `Hirado
   Suntan' S-1 seedlings and 6 of 13 adult `Banpeiyu' S-1 seedlings showed
   parthenocarpic fruit set and growth, supporting that the three dominant
   complementary genes control autonomous parthenocarpy in Citrus. When a
   precocious-flowering seedling in which the parthenocarpic growth of the
   fruit had been observed for more than one month after anthesis were
   top-worked on the adult satsuma trees, the grafted seedling produced
   seedless fruits of the same size as seeded fruits on the same trees
   seven years after the grafting. Based on this result, we selected the
   high degree of parthenocarpic hybrid seedlings in which the growth of
   fruits is seen for more than one month after precocious flowering in
   each of the five crosses. It could be said that this method with
   precocious flowering is useful for the other crosses generating
   precocious-flowering seedlings to select high degree of parthenocarpic
   hybrid seedlings within one year after pollination in Citrus.}},

Abstract = {{Pear (Pyrus bretschneiden) is characterized by being self-incompatible
   and dependent on cross-pollination to set fruit. Honeybee (Apis
   mellifera) is considered the most important pollinator of pear.
   Nevertheless, limited pollen transfer has been cited as the main cause
   of poor fruit set in many pear orchards. Here, we tested the following
   hypotheses: (i) colony manipulations increase the pollen collection
   tendency of honeybees and (ii) the proportion of pollen loads being
   returned to the hive is from the target plant. The technique reliably
   and rapidly estimates the pollination of honeybees tested under
   different colony manipulations: (1) using pollen trapping (PT); (2) PT
   with sugar syrup feeding (SS) (PTSS); (3) SS alone and (4) control
   without PT and SS. The results clearly show that the pollen collection
   of honeybees during the experiment was significantly affected (P < 0.05)
   by colony manipulations. The mean amount of pollen harvested daily was
   higher for PTSS (19.4 g) and PT (16.4 g) than for SS (12.85 g) and
   control (8.7 g) colonies. Therefore, PTSS was the most effective
   treatment for increasing pear pollen collection; other treatments such
   as PT and SS could also be useful. This study was important for
   determining how the behavior of honeybee colonies is shaped through
   colony manipulation to enhance pollen collection of less preferred pear
   flowers, which is critical when pollination is required.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is an essential ecosystem service for human welfare and for
   the survival of many species. Most of the main crops in our diet, as
   well as many wild species, depend on pollinators to produce fruits,
   vegetables and seeds. In the last decade it has been reported that
   environmental deterioration has had a negative effect in the abundance
   and diversity of pollinators as a result of habitat fragmentation,
   deforestation, agriculture, agrochemicals, invasive species, pollinator
   diseases, and climate change, among other factors. The current risk that
   pollination faces, highlights the urgent need to review the current
   state of knowledge related to this environmental problem. This note aims
   at giving a general overview of the main factors affecting pollinators,
   as well as their negative effects over the pollination of wild and
   cultivated species; it discusses examples reported in Latin America, and
   particularly in Mexico; and suggests lines of research that should be
   addressed in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Weather may alter the concentrations of pollens which can subsequently
   influence the occurrence of allergic diseases. Many studies have
   demonstrated that greenhouse gases increase pollen concentration. Daily
   fluctuations in the pollen concentration have to do with a variety of
   meteorological factors such as temperature, rainfall and sunshine
   amount; therefore, it is complicated. At least more than 10 weather
   elements that affect the concentration of pollen. Earlier pollination
   and rising pollen concentrations have been reported in many countries.
   Most studies have focused on analysis of their relationships with local
   meteorological and climatic factors. Observed pollen data at locations
   representing a wide range of geographic and climatic conditions should
   be analyzed statistically to identify pollination date, pollen season
   length, and annual mean and peak values of daily concentrations of
   pollen. The seasonal and regional variations of pollen have also been
   changed in South Korea with climate change. There were evaluated
   sensitization rate to pollen in South Korea since 1997. Sensitization
   rates for weed and tree pollens are increased in Korean children,
   especially with increasing pollen concentration of ragweed and Japanese
   hop. It has been demonstrated that urbanization correlate with the
   increasing pollen allergies. However, the effects of environmental
   change on allergic diseases have not yet been completely understood.
   Recently there have been many epidemiological studies on the
   relationship between allergic diseases and climate changes. Previous
   studies suggest that climate changes interact with and affect pollen
   allergy, which in turn increases the frequency and severity of allergic
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Citizen science can play an important role in school science education.
   Citizen science is particularly relevant to addressing current societal
   environmental sustainability challenges, as it engages the students
   directly with environmental science and gives students an understanding
   of the scientific process. In addition, it allows students to observe
   local representations of global challenges. Here, we report a citizen
   science programme designed to engage school-age children in real-world
   scientific research. The programme used standardized methods deployed
   across multiple schools through scientist-school partnerships to engage
   students with an important conservation problem: habitat for pollinator
   insects in urban environments. Citizen science programmes such as the
   programme presented here can be used to enhance scientific literacy and
   skills. Provided key challenges to maintain data quality are met, this
   approach is a powerful way to contribute valuable citizen science data
   for understudied, but ecologically important study systems, particularly
   in urban environments across broad geographical areas.}},

Abstract = {{CITRULLUS colocynthis (L.) is a desert plant having a large history in
   pharmaceutical industries as an important medicinal plant. Allozyme
   variation and population genetic structure of C. colocynthis in 6
   natural populations from western region, Saudi Arabia, were investigated
   by 6 enzyme systems. The genetic differentiation within and among C.
   colocynthis populations has been revealed by allozyme analysis. Ten loci
   were monomorphic in all populations, whereas seven loci having two
   alleles (alpha-EST-1, beta-EST-1, MDH-1, ADH-4, ADH-5, ALO-4 and PRX-2)
   were polymorphic. The mean allozyme variability indices within C.
   colocynthis populations (P = 31.17\%; A = 1.21) were lower than those
   for insect-pollinated species (P = 34\%; A= 2.67; H-e = 0.205) except
   H-e value (0.415) was higher. The observed mean heterozygosity (H-o =
   0.757) was higher than the expected mean heterozygosity (H-e = 0.415)
   indicating the existence of natural selection against homozygosity. The
   Inbreeding coefficient values (F) of polymorphic loci were negative
   suggesting a significant excess of heterozygosity in the studied
   populations. The UPGMA dendrogram of 84 individuals of C. colocynthis
   confirmed the notable variability within populations. Differentiation
   among-population (F-ST) recorded 16.2\% of the total variation. Low
   F-ST, and high genetic distance (D) values suggested a low
   differentiation among C. colocynthis populations. Little gene flow (N-m)
   was deduced in all populations except ME based on the allozyme data. We
   suggest that population ME can be recommended for both genetic
   conservation and breeding programs.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{35-43}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Threats to global food security have generated the need for novel food
   production techniques to feed an ever-expanding population with
   ever-declining land resources. Hydroponic cultivation has been long
   recognised as a reliable, resilient and resource-use-efficient
   alternative to soil-based agricultural practices. The aspiration for
   highly efficient systems and even city-based vertical farms is starting
   to become realised using innovations such as aeroponics and LED lighting
   technology. However, the ultimate challenge for any crop production
   system is to be able to operate and help sustain human life in remote
   and extreme locations, including the polar regions on Earth, and in
   space. Here we explore past research and crop growth in such remote
   areas, and the scope to improve on the systems used in these areas to
   date. We introduce biointensive agricultural systems and 3D growing
   environments, intercropping in hydroponics and the production of
   multiple crops from single growth systems. To reflect the flexibility
   and adaptability of these approaches to different environments we have
   called this type of enclosed system `pop-up agriculture'. The vision
   here is built on sustainability, maximising yield from the smallest
   growing footprint, adopting the principles of a circular economy, using
   local resources and eliminating waste. We explore plant companions in
   intercropping systems to supply a diversity of plant foods. We argue
   that it is time to consume all edible components of plants grown,
   highlighting that nutritious plant parts are often wasted that could
   provide vitamins and antioxidants. Supporting human life via crop
   production in remote and isolated communities necessitates new levels of
   efficiency, eliminating waste, minimising environmental impacts and
   trying to wean away from our dependence on fossil fuels. This aligns
   well with tandem research emerging from economically developing
   countries where lower technology hydroponic approaches are being
   trialled reinforcing the need for `cross-pollination' of ideas and
   research development on pop-up agriculture that will see benefits across
   a range of environments.}},

Abstract = {{Wild bee community assemblages were surveyed in a high-elevation mixed
   conifer forest in central Colorado at multiple points during the growing
   season (April-August) and across a range of forest stand densities using
   blue vane traps. Understory forb communities were also characterized and
   related to bee species abundance and diversity. Overall gamma-diversity
   was characterized by 19 genera of bees captured representing five
   families (Andrenidae, Apidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, and Megachilidae)
   and 39 unique species. Seasonal variation in abundance and community
   composition was considerable with early-season (April) communities
   dominated by Osmia spp. and midsummer (June-July) communities dominated
   by Bombus spp. Bee abundance and alpha-diversity were on average 88 and
   74\% higher in midsummer than in early- and late season. Forest basal
   area was negatively correlated with bee alpha-diversity and abundance,
   as well as understory plant species richness.Trapping locations with a
   stand basal area of a6 m(2)/ha exhibited approximately 54\% higher bee
   abundances and 44\% higher alpha-diversity than locations with 20.0
   m(2)/ha of basal area. Bee alpha-diversity and abundance positively
   correlated with understory species richness suggesting that forested
   sites with low basal area, likely corresponding to overstory canopy gaps
   and increased site occupancy by forbaceous species, may drive local
   abundance and diversity of wild bee assemblages. This study provides
   basal area threshold values in a mixed conifer forest type that may be
   useful for resource management practitioners concerned with creating or
   conserving pollinator habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Cycads are the most endangered of plant groups based on IUCN Red List
   assessments; all are in Appendix I or II of CITES, about 40\% are within
   biodiversity `hotspots,' and the call for action to improve their
   protection is long-standing. We contend that progress in this direction
   will not be made until there is better understanding of cycad pollen,
   seed and tissue biology, which at the moment is limited to relatively
   few (< 10\%) species. We review what is known about germplasm (seed and
   pollen) storage and germination, together with recent developments in
   the application of contemporary technologies to tissues, such as isotype
   labelling, biomolecular markers and tissue culture. Whilst progress is
   being made, we conclude that an acceleration of comparative studies is
   needed to facilitate the integration of in situ and ex situ conservation
   programmes to better safeguard endangered cycads.}},

Abstract = {{With a view to obtaining fuller information on airborne pollen content
   in the city of Havana, pollen sampling was carried out using a
   volumetric capture method, for the first time in Cuba. The study was
   conducted during 2 years (2011 and 2015). An annual pollen integral of
   3414 grains was registered during the first year of study, whereas 5120
   grains were observed along the 2015. Monthly maximum concentrations were
   recorded during April, June and July with total values close to 800
   pollen grains. Of the 45 pollen types identified, Cecropia (38\% of the
   total pollen identified in both years), Poaceae (18\%), Urera type (9\%)
   and Casuarina (6\%) were particularly abundant. Although the main pollen
   types differed in terms of intradiurnal distribution, the highest
   concentrations were in all cases recorded between 0900 and 1300 hours.
   Maximum temperature was the variable most influencing airborne pollen
   counts in the air, with the exception of Casuarina. This paper sought to
   establish a methodological basis for the further development of
   aerobiological research in Cuba, thus helping to enhance the prevention
   and diagnosis of pollen allergies in the affected island population.}},

Abstract = {{Geopropolis, a different type of propolis, presents a mixture of resin
   and exudates, containing wax, silt, and sand particles. This product has
   been the subject of research interest for its physicochemical
   properties, economic importance, and likely for environmental
   monitoring. The determination of toxic metals in hive products has been
   reported as an efficient tool for environmental monitoring. As the honey
   production is now common in urban environments, this study aimed to
   determine the concentration of toxic metals in the Melipona scutellaris
   geopropolis of the Metropolitan Region of Salvador, Bahia. Geopropolis
   and soil samples were collected from seven important beehives between
   June 2015 and July 2016. After EPA 3050B acid digestion procedure,
   metals were determined by ICP OES. As the geopropolis is partially made
   from soil, the values of Cr and Fe were extremely more important than
   the values reported in propolis, wax, and honey found in other worldwide
   studies. It gives different characteristics to this product depending on
   the location of the hive and characterizes it as an efficient
   integrating indicator of soil pollution. Using the enrichment factor, we
   determined that the soils around the meliponary are not or only slightly
   polluted by Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn. However, there was a shift in the
   particle size of geopropolis, being loamier and less sandy than the
   surrounding soil. In such case, a higher metal content could be
   expected, though no metal enrichment in the geopropolis was found, even
   a decrease in zinc, possibly due to the exclusion of metals by bees, was
   noted. Nevertheless, the results on the proportions of lithogenic metal
   and anthropogenic metal indicate that some metals have an external
   origin (about 20\% for Ni and Cu). Geopropolis can be considered as a
   good environmental indicator even in low contaminated areas. (C) 2018

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{285}},
Number = {{1884}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Native species are increasingly living in urban landscapes associated
   with abiotic and biotic changes that may influence patterns of
   phenotypic selection. However, measures of selection in urban and
   non-urban environments, and exploration of the mechanisms associated
   with such changes, are uncommon. Plant-animal interactions have played a
   central role in the evolution of flowering plants and are sensitive to
   changes in the urban landscape, and thus provide opportunities to
   explore how urban environments modify selection. We evaluated patterns
   of phenotypic selection on the floral and resistance traits of Gelsemium
   sempervirens in urban and non-urban sites. The urban landscape had
   increased florivory and decreased pollen receipt, but showed only modest
   differences in patterns of selection. Directional selection for one
   trait, larger floral display size, was stronger in urban compared to
   non-urban sites. Neither quadratic nor correlational selection
   significantly differed between urban and non-urban sites. Pollination
   was associated with selection for larger floral display size in urban
   compared to non-urban sites, due to the differences in the translation
   of pollination into seeds rather than pollinator selectivity. Thus, our
   data suggest that urban landscapes may not result in sweeping
   differences in phenotypic selection but rather modest differences for
   some traits, potentially mediated by species interactions.}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Allergic diseases, including respiratory conditions of allergic rhinitis
   (hay fever) and asthma, affect up to 500 million people worldwide. Grass
   pollen are one major source of aeroallergens globally. Pollen forecast
   methods are generally site-based and rely on empirical meteorological
   relationships and/or the use of labour-intensive pollen collection traps
   that are restricted to sparse sampling locations. The spatial and
   temporal dynamics of the grass pollen sources themselves, however, have
   received less attention. Here we utilised a consistent set of MODIS
   satellite measures of grass cover and seasonal greenness (EVI) over five
   contrasting urban environments, located in Northern (France) and
   Southern Hemispheres (Australia), to evaluate their utility for
   predicting airborne grass pollen concentrations. Strongly seasonal and
   pronounced pollinating periods, synchronous with satellite measures of
   grass cover greenness, were found at the higher latitude temperate sites
   in France (46-50 degrees N. Lat.), with peak pollen activity lagging
   peak greenness, on average by 2-3 weeks. In contrast, the Australian
   sites (34-38 degrees S. Lat.) displayed pollinating periods that were
   less synchronous with satellite greenness measures as peak pollen
   concentrations lagged peak greenness by as much as 4 to 7 weeks. The
   Australian sites exhibited much higher spatial and inter-annual
   variations compared to the French sites and at the Sydney site, broader
   and multiple peaks in both pollen concentrations and greenness data
   coincided with flowering of more diverse grasses including subtropical
   species. Utilising generalised additive models (GAMs) we found the
   satellite greenness data of grass cover areas explained 80-90\% of
   airborne grass pollen concentrations across the three French sites (p <
   0.001) and accounted for 34 to 76\% of grass pollen variations over the
   two sites in Australia (p < 0.05). Our results demonstrate the potential
   of satellite sensing to augment forecast models of grass pollen
   aerobiology as a tool to reduce the health and socioeconomic burden of
   pollen-sensitive allergic diseases. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{MITE insertion-dependent expression of CitRKD1 with a RWP-RK domain
   regulates somatic embryogenesis in citrus nucellar tissues}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{AUG 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Somatic embryogenesis in nucellar tissues is widely
   recognized to induce polyembryony in major citrus varieties such as
   sweet oranges, satsuma mandarins and lemons. This capability for
   apomixis is attractive in agricultural production systems using hybrid
   seeds, and many studies have been performed to elucidate the molecular
   mechanisms of various types of apomixis. To identify the gene
   responsible for somatic embryogenesis in citrus, a custom oligo-DNA
   microarray including predicted genes in the citrus polyembryonic locus
   was used to compare the expression profiles in reproductive tissues
   between monoembryonic and polyembryonic varieties. The full length of
   CitRKD1, which was identified as a candidate gene responsible for citrus
   somatic embryogenesis, was isolated from satsuma mandarin and its
   molecular function was investigated using transgenic `Hamlin' sweet
   orange by antisense-overexpression.
   Results: The candidate gene CitRKD1, predominantly transcribed in
   reproductive tissues of polyembryonic varieties, is a member of the
   plant RWP-RK domain-containing protein. CitRKD1 of satsuma mandarin
   comprised two alleles (CitRKD1-mg1 and CitRKD1-mg2) at the polyembryonic
   locus controlling embryonic type (mono/polyembryony) that were
   structurally divided into two types with or without a miniature
   inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE)-like insertion in the
   upstream region. CitRKD1-mgt with the MITE insertion was the predominant
   transcript in flowers and young fruits where somatic embryogenesis of
   nucellar cells occurred. Loss of CitRKD1 function by
   antisense-overexpression abolished somatic embryogenesis in transgenic
   sweet orange and the transgenic T-1 plants were confirmed to derive from
   zygotic embryos produced by self-pollination by DNA diagnosis.
   Genotyping PCR analysis of 95 citrus traditional and breeding varieties
   revealed that the CitRKD1 allele with the MITE insertion (polyembryonic
   allele) was dominant and major citrus varieties with the polyembryonic
   allele produced polyembryonic seeds.
   Conclusion: CitRKD1 at the polyembryonic locus plays a principal role in
   regulating citrus somatic embryogenesis. CitRKD1 comprised multiple
   alleles that were divided into two types, polyembryonic alleles with a
   MITE insertion in the upstream region and monoembryonic alleles without
   it CitRKD1 was transcribed in reproductive tissues of polyembryonic
   varieties with the polyembryonic allele. The MITE insertion in the
   upstream region of CitRKD1 might be involved in regulating the
   transcription of CitRKD1.}},

Abstract = {{Mounting evidence suggests declines in the abundance and diversity of
   wild bees. Increasing habitat that provides forage and nesting sites
   could boost struggling populations, particularly in urban, suburban and
   agricultural landscapes. The millions of acres beneath aerial electric
   transmission lines, sometimes referred to as easements or rights-of-way,
   must be kept free of tall-growing vegetation and hence have the
   potential to provide suitable habitat for many native species. Prior
   work has demonstrated that bee communities in easements managed using
   alternatives to episodic mowing were more diverse than in nearby open
   areas, however true control sites within the easements were unavailable.
   In order to compare vegetation management protocols, we conducted a
   two-year study which enabled us to directly compare transmission line
   easements in three locations currently undergoing Integrated Vegetation
   Management-a dynamic form of management involving spot removal and
   herbicide treatment of unwanted species (treatment) with nearby sites
   undergoing standard management protocols of yearly or biyearly mowing
   (control). Results show that treatment sites had significantly higher
   abundance and species richness than controls. Seasonal differences were
   pronounced, with the spring fauna most affected by differences in
   vegetation management. In addition, the older treatment sites house more
   social bees, more parasitic species and a more even distribution of bees
   across nesting guilds. Finally, we established that treatment sites had
   distinct bee communities, further increasing their value as sources for
   native bee populations in the landscape. Overall, the data clearly show
   the value of implementing alternative active vegetation management in
   the land under powerlines to achieve an increase in the abundance and
   diversity of wild bees.}},

Title = {{Selection of an essential oil from Corymbia and Eucalyptus plants

Abstract = {{Due to an increase in environmental and health issues and with the
   excessive use of synthetic pesticides, many studies are investigating
   plant essential oils (EOs) for pest control. These compounds are
   considered safe control agents since they have low toxicity to
   non-target organisms. Thus, this study aimed to select potential EOs
   from the Myrtaceae family and their constituents for the control of
   Ascia monuste (Godart) and to evaluate those EOs selectivity to two
   non-target organisms (Solenopsis saevissima Smith and Tetragonisca
   angustula Latreille). Twelve EOs, extracted by hydrodistillation from
   Corymbia and Eucalyptus plants, were tested in this study. All toxicity
   bioassays were performed by topical application. C. citriodora EO had
   the highest insecticidal activity against A. monuste (LD50 = 20.61 mu
   g/mg) and also presented a fast action (LT50 < 10 min). Citronellal was
   the main compound of C. citriodora EO (86.8\% of the oil constitution)
   and exhibited toxicity similar to this EO. The other compounds caused no
   significant mortality. Hence, the toxicity of the C. citriodora EO is
   mostly explained by the citronellal activity. This EO was selective in
   favor of the predatory ant S. saevissima but caused high mortality of
   the pollinator bee T angustula. Therefore, C. citriodora EO is a
   promising model in the development of insecticides against A. monuste.
   However, to mitigate its impact over pollinators, its application must
   rely on the principles of ecological selectivity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Since the launch of Ecology Letters in 1998, the field of Pollination
   Ecology has changed considerably in its focus. In this review, we
   discuss the major discoveries across the past two decades. We
   quantitatively synthesise the frequency by which different concepts and
   topics appeared in the peer-reviewed literature, as well as the
   connections between these topics. We then look forward to identify
   pressing research frontiers and opportunities for additional integration
   in the future. We find that there has been a shift towards viewing
   plant-pollinator interactions as networks and towards understanding how
   global drivers influence the plants, pollinators and the ecosystem
   service of pollination. Future frontiers include moving towards a
   macroecological view of plant-pollinator interactions, understanding how
   ecological intensification and urbanisation will influence pollination,
   considering other interactions, such as plant-microbe-pollinator
   networks, and understanding the causes and consequences of extinctions.
   Pollination Ecology is poised to advance our basic understanding of the
   ecological and evolutionary factors that shape plant-animal interactions
   and to create applied knowledge that informs conservation decision
   making.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3837-3848}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization involves a cocktail of human-induced rapid environmental
   changes and is forecasted to gain further importance. Urban-heat-island
   effects result in increased metabolic costs expected to drive shifts
   towards smaller body sizes. However, urban environments are also
   characterized by strong habitat fragmentation, often selecting for
   dispersal phenotypes. Here, we investigate to what extent, and at which
   spatial scale(s), urbanization drives body size shifts in macro-mothsan
   insect group characterized by positive size-dispersal linksat both the
   community and intraspecific level. Using light and bait trapping as part
   of a replicated, spatially nested sampling design, we show that despite
   the observed urban warming of their woodland habitat, macro-moth
   communities display considerable increases in community-weighted mean
   body size because of stronger filtering against small species along
   urbanization gradients. Urbanization drives intraspecific shifts towards
   increased body size too, at least for a third of species analysed. These
   results indicate that urbanization drives shifts towards larger, and
   hence, more mobile species and individuals in order to mitigate low
   connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings. Macro-moths are
   a key group within terrestrial ecosystems, and since body size is
   central to species interactions, such urbanization-driven phenotypic
   change may impact urban ecosystem functioning, especially in terms of
   nocturnal pollination and food web dynamics. Although we show that
   urbanization's size-biased filtering happens simultaneously and
   coherently at both the inter- and intraspecific level, we demonstrate
   that the impact at the community level is most pronounced at the 800 m
   radius scale, whereas species-specific size increases happen at local
   and landscape scales (50-3,200m radius), depending on the species.
   Hence, measuressuch as creating and improving urban green
   infrastructureto mitigate the effects of urbanization on body size will
   have to be implemented at multiple spatial scales in order to be most
   effective.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinating insects are integral to the health of all terrestrial
   ecosystems and agriculture worldwide. Urbanization can greatly reduce
   nutritional resources and habitat for pollinators. However, these losses
   can be mitigated through targeted landscape practices, such as planting
   nectar- and pollen-rich plants and managing pollinator habitat in urban
   areas, especially home landscapes. As homeowners attempt to conserve
   pollinators through horticultural practices, they often seek the advice
   and guidance of horticulture retail employees. The knowledge
   horticulture employees have about pollinators and the recommendations
   they provide to customers is largely unknown. A nationwide survey was
   developed and distributed with the objectives to 1) assess employee
   knowledge about pollinators and pollination biology, 2) discover what
   plant and management recommendations employees were giving customers
   pertaining to pollinator conservation, and 3) determine where to focus
   possible education and outreach, as well as which topics to focus
   educational programs on. Our findings suggest, among our respondents,
   that overall knowledge was adequate, with a mean score (+/- SD) being
   8.37 (+/- 3.23) of a possible range of 0-14 points. Uncertified and
   part-time employees were identified as having significantly lower
   scores. The subject of plant selection was found to have the largest gap
   in knowledge, with a mean score of 1.82 (+/- 0.62) of a possible three
   points. We identified several opportunities for educational outreach,
   aimed at improving employee and customer knowledge on this important
   subject.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term and widespread monitoring programs are essential to
   understanding the role of human-dominated landscapes in supporting wild
   bee populations. Urbanization results in increased impervious surfaces
   throughout the landscape, fragmentation of green space, and a loss of
   naturally occurring floral vegetation. All of these changes have a
   negative impact on pollinator diversity. The objective of this study was
   to assess the abundance and richness of wild bee species throughout a
   small city in northwest Pennsylvania and identify how management of land
   throughout the city may influence bee communities. Seventeen sites
   across a land use gradient, moving from areas with large open spaces and
   mainly permeable surfaces, to sites in the city center consisting of
   mainly impermeable surfaces, were sampled over a 2-year period. During
   this time, 106 known species were identified with four state records and
   1 undescribed species. Bee species richness was greatest at sites with
   the largest amount of permeable surface and naturally-occurring, native
   vegetation. Richness decreased on the college campus and city center
   where landscapes were highly managed and impermeable surfaces were most
   abundant. While floral richness was not related to bee abundance and
   richness, the number of open blooms near traps did have a positive
   impact on bee species richness. Overall, this survey revealed
   considerable richness never before recorded for northwest Pennsylvania,
   suggesting the importance of conservation management in homeowner and
   community yard space.}},

Abstract = {{Planting milkweeds on public and private lands has emerged as a central
   conservation strategy for restoring declining North American migratory
   populations of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). Nearly all
   actionable science on this issue has focused on restoring common
   milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.) in rural land types. The aim of this
   study was to develop recommendations for the best milkweeds for managed
   gardens intended to support both monarch butterflies and bees. Eight
   milkweed (Asclepias) species varying in height, form, and leaf shape
   were grown in a common-garden experiment at a public arboretum. We
   measured milkweed growth, tillering, and bloom periods, conducted
   bi-weekly counts of eggs and larvae to assess colonization by wild
   monarchs, and evaluated suitability for growth of monarch larvae. We
   also quantified bee visitation and compared the bee assemblages
   associated with six of the eight species, augmented with additional
   collections from other sites. Monarchs rapidly colonized the gardens,
   but did not equally use all of the milkweed species. More eggs and
   larvae were found on taller, broad-leaved milkweeds, but there was
   relatively little difference in larval performance, suggesting
   ovipositional preference for more apparent plants. Asclepias tuberosa
   and A. fascicularis attracted the greatest number of bees, whereas bee
   genus diversity was greatest on A. verticillata, A. fascicularis, and A.
   tuberosa. Milkweeds that do not spread extensively by tillering may be
   best suited for managed gardens. Combining milkweeds that are preferred
   by ovipositing monarchs with ones that are particularly attractive to
   bees may enhance conservation value of small urban gardens.}},

Abstract = {{Orchid bees are important pollinators in tropical forests. Although
   studies have already detected effects of habitat loss and forest
   fragmentation on bee assemblages, little is known about orchid bees in
   urban forest fragments. The aim of this study was to analyse the
   influence of forest fragments (size and edge index) and landscape
   features (forest cover area and built-up area around the forest
   fragments, connectivity and spatial distance from the urban center) on
   the abundance, richness and composition of orchid bees. Male bees were
   attracted by odoriferous baits and collected in ten forest fragments of
   different sizes. In total, we collected 3166 male bees belonging to 4
   genera and 38 species. The increase of the built-up area and the
   reduction of the forest cover area around the forest fragments decreased
   the abundance and richness of bees. We recorded a smaller number of bees
   in areas closer to the urban center. We failed to find a significant
   relationship between abundance/richness of bees and forest fragment
   area, edge index, and connectivity. We observed that the faunistic
   dissimilarity was positively correlated with the geographic distance
   between forest fragments. The forest fragments that presented greater
   landscape dissimilarity also presented greater faunistic dissimilarity.
   Our results suggest that the matrix structure around the forest
   fragments is an important factor that influences the Euglossini bee
   assemblages inside these forest fragments. Based on our results, we
   believed that the conservation of fragments with a larger forest cover
   area and smaller built-up areas around them contribute to the
   maintenance of the diversity of orchid bees and their pollination
   services.}},

Abstract = {{People seek connectedness with nature, as evidenced by 8billion people
   per year visiting terrestrial parks alone. Yet the challenge is for
   people to appreciate and care for nature, including insects, on which we
   so crucially depend for so many services. Current environmental policy
   is often a dichotomy of mutually exclusive opposites: instrumental
   valuation vs. intrinsic valuation. This unhelpful division can be
   overcome by valuing nature through appreciation of spatial extent (local
   to global) relative to biological level (gene through population and
   species, to ecosystem) and understanding that human well-being is a
   two-way process of caring for nature nature providing a well-being
   platform for us. However, human relationships with nature are complex,
   as they are with insects too. The human brain is not well equipped to
   deal with topics that are complex, seemingly far away in space and time,
   and are nebulous. These topics beget inaction by the public at large on,
   for example, global change. Neither are we well equipped to value
   insects, despite scientific understanding of their importance to our
   well-being. However, we are at least rising to the pollination crisis,
   as we can relate to the tangible bee and our food security. To improve
   insect conservation awareness and action, we need to engage insect
   conservation psychology. Citizen science and Red Listing are playing
   major roles here, as is the camera, which magnifies and makes insects
   more meaningful to us. Using insect conservation psychology, we are
   better able to instill a culture of personal and social responsibility,
   and so create political will to drive insect conservation from paper to
   action.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Through the rapid expansion worldwide of impervious areas and habitat
   fragmentation, urbanization has strong consequences that must be
   understood to efficiently manage biodiversity. We studied the effects of
   urbanization on flower-feeding insects by using data from a citizen
   science program in the Parisian region. We analysed the occurrence of
   insects from 46 different families on flowers of different morphologies,
   using landscape indices in buffer areas from a 100-m to a 4000-m radius
   around 1194 sampled sites. Our aims were to determine (i) how the
   proportion of impervious area around sampled sites affected the
   occurrence of flower-feeding insect families and at which landscape
   scales impervious area calculations best predicted these occurrences;
   (ii) the effect of corolla shape variables on insect family occurrences.
   Twenty-one families were negatively impacted by increasing proportion of
   impervious areas (urbanophobic) and 3 were positively impacted
   (urbanophilic). Urbanophobic families were most affected by the
   proportion of impervious areas when it was estimated within buffers of
   200-m to 1400-m radii, depending on the family. Notable losses of
   urbanophobic families were detected at less than 50\% of impervious
   areas, which highlights the threat to the diversity of flower-feeding
   insects posed by urban sprawl. Corolla shape variables were the
   variables most often significantly implicated in the occurrence of
   insect families. Urbanophobic families were negatively affected by the
   tubular shape of flowers, and tubular corollas were found more often in
   urbanized areas. These results suggest that flora management might be a
   key component for the conservation of insect diversity in cities.}},

Journal = {{EUPHYTICA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{214}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The estimation of quantitative genetic parameters in breeding programs
   is important to ensure efficient selection. In this context, knowledge
   of the mating system is critical, as it underpins assumptions about
   inter-relatedness on which variance component estimation depends.
   However, proper account of the breeding system is not always taken,
   either because it is unknown and/or because it is ignored. That
   eucalypts have a mixed-mating system is well-established, however many
   breeders use models that assume outcrossed mating with an infinite
   number of male parents (i.e. allogamous mating), from which genetic
   parameter estimates are then used to predict genetic gains.
   First-generation, open-pollinated progeny tests of Corymbia citriodora
   subsp. citriodora and C. citriodora subsp. variegata, being managed for
   seed production, were used to investigate the likely bias, resulting in
   overestimation of genetic parameters under the assumption of allogamous
   mating. When we assumed allogamous mating, we observed inflated
   predictions of additive variance and narrow-sense heritability () of
   diameter at breast height and height. The overestimate of was
   approximately 32\% for C. citriodora subsp. citriodora and 21\% for C.
   citriodora subsp. variegata. Inappropriate modelling of relatedness in
   eucalypts that assumes panmictic outcrossing when in fact these species
   have a mixed-mating system results in overestimates of the population
   genetic gain with selection.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring plant and animal phenology is a critical step to anticipating
   and predicting changes in species interactions and biodiversity. Because
   phenology necessarily involves frequent and repeated observations over
   time, citizen scientists have become a vital part of collecting
   phenological data. However, there is still concern over the accuracy and
   precision of citizen science data. It is possible that training citizen
   scientists can improve data quality though there are few comparisons of
   trained and untrained citizen scientists in the ability of each to
   accurately and precisely measure phenology. We assessed how three types
   of observers-experts, trained citizen scientists that make repeated
   observations, and untrained citizen scientists making once-per-year
   observations-differ in quantifying temporal change in flower and fruit
   abundance of American mountain ash trees (Sorbus americana Marsh.) and
   arthropods in Acadia National Park, Maine, USA. We found that trained
   more so than untrained citizen science observers over- or
   under-estimated abundances leading to precise but inaccurate
   characterizations of phenological patterns. Our results suggest a new
   type of bias induced by repeated observations: A type of learning takes
   place that reduces the independence of observations taken on different
   trees or different dates. Thus, in this and many other cases, having
   individuals make one-off observations of marked plants may produce data
   as good if not better than individuals making repeated observations. For
   citizen science programs related to phenology, our results underscore
   the importance of (a) attracting the most number of observers possible
   even if they only make one observation, (b) producing easy-to-use and
   informative data sheets, and (c) carefully planning effective training
   programs that are, perhaps, repeated at different points during the data
   collection period.}},

Title = {{Habitat and landscape factors influence pollinators in a tropical
   megacity, Bangkok, Thailand}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pollinators are well known for the ecosystem services they
   provide, an d while urban areas are generally perceived as low-quality
   habitat for most wildlife, these cities often support a surprising
   degree of pollinator diversity. The current rapid growth of urban areas
   and concern over global pollinator declines have spurred numerous
   studies examining pollinator communities in temperate cities, but
   knowledge about tropical urban pollinators remains scarce.
   Methods: This study investigated the effects of habitat and landscape
   factors on pollinator richness and abundance in a highly-populated,
   tropical city: Bangkok, Thailand. We conducted pollinator observations
   in 52 green areas throughout the city and collected data on patch size,
   floral abundance, plant richness, location type, and percent vegetation
   at five spatial scales.
   Results: Of the 18,793 pollinators observed, over 98\% were bees. Both
   patch size and floral abundance generally had positive effects on
   pollinators, although there was a significant interaction between the
   two factors; these findings were generally consistent across all focal
   taxa (Tetragonula stingless bees, Apis honey bees, Xylocopa carpenter
   bees, and butterflies).
   Discussion: Our results demonstrate the importance of maintaining large
   green areas in cities, since small green areas supported few
   pollinators, even when floral resources were abundant. Moreover, most
   pollinator taxa utilized a variety of location types (e.g., public
   parks, school campuses, temple grounds), with the exception of
   butterflies, which preferred parks. Our findings are generally
   consistent with those of temperate urban studies, but additional studies
   in the tropics are needed before global patterns can be assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Of the many roles insects serve for ecosystem function, pollination is
   possibly the most important service directly linked to human well-being.
   However, land use changes have contributed to the decline of pollinators
   and their habitats. In agricultural landscapes that also support
   renewable energy developments such as utility-scale solar energy
   {[}USSE] facilities, opportunities may exist to conserve insect
   pollinators and locally restore their ecosystem services through the
   implementation of vegetation management approaches that aim to provide
   and maintain pollinator habitat at USSE facilities. As a first step
   toward understanding the potential agricultural benefits of solar
   pollinator habitat, we identified areas of overlap between USSE
   facilities and surrounding pollinator-dependent crop types in the United
   States (U.S.). Using spatial data on solar energy developments and crop
   types across the U.S., and assuming a pollinator foraging distance of
   1.5 km, we identified over 3,500 km(2) of agricultural land near
   existing and planned USSE facilities that may benefit from increased
   pollination services through the creation of pollinator habitat at the
   USSE facilities. The following five pollinator-dependent crop types
   accounted for over 90\% of the agriculture near USSE facilities, and
   these could benefit most from the creation of pollinator habitat at
   existing and planned USSE facilities: soybeans, alfalfa, cotton,
   almonds, and citrus. We discuss how our results may be used to
   understand potential agro-economic implications of solar-pollinator
   habitat. Our results show that ecosystem service restoration through the
   creation of pollinator habitat could improve the sustainability of
   large-scale renewable energy developments in agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination research in Brazil virtually started with Fritz Muller,
   whose insights supported Darwin's evolutionary theory. Pollination
   systems of Brazilian plants were studied mainly by travelling
   researchers until early last century when native or resident geneticists
   began to use floral biology information to deal with crop
   acclimatization and breeding, later applying similar experiments and
   techniques to investigate native plants. Bee geneticists studied common
   pollinators of crops, such as coffee and Citrus, and even the
   introduction of feral African honeybees, despite their associated
   problems, stimulated pollination research. Geneticists attracted
   Dobzhansky to Brazil, where his research on tree distribution in the
   Brazilian Amazon represented a turning point for tropical pollination
   research by prompting the discovery of long-distance pollinating bees,
   thus bringing pollination back to mainstream evolutionary research.
   Tropical pollination studies stimulated the emergence of research groups
   in the Amazon and Sao Paulo states. In 1998, a seminal conference held
   in Sao Paulo called for the need to conserve pollinators and pollination
   systems. Subsequent research has been integrated under the Brazilian
   Pollinators Initiative, with research groups established throughout the
   country. A revived International Pollination Course, a National
   Pollination Symposium, and cooperative efforts to tackle complex
   interaction networks may direct future pollination research in Brazil.}},

Title = {{Contrasting responses in community structure and phenology of migratory
   and non-migratory pollinators to urbanization}},
Journal = {{DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{919-927}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Anthropogenic landscape change, such as urbanization, can affect
   community structure and ecological interactions. Furthermore, changes in
   ambient temperature and resource availability due to urbanization may
   affect migratory and non-migratory species differently. However, the
   response of migratory species to urbanization is poorly investigated,
   and knowledge for invertebrates in particular is lacking. Our aim was to
   investigate whether there was a shift in community structure and
   phenology of hoverflies in urban landscapes, depending on migratory
   status.
   Location: Switzerland.
   Methods: Using a paired design, we compared urban and rural landscapes
   to investigate the impact of urbanization on the abundance, diversity
   and phenology of hoverflies. Furthermore, we tested whether migratory
   and non-migratory species responded differently to urbanization.
   Results: We observed a difference in the response of migratory and
   non-migratory hoverfly communities. Although the abundance of hoverflies
   was higher in the rural ecosystem, driven by a high abundance of
   migratory species, there was no difference in species richness between
   the land use types. However, the community structure of non-migratory
   species was significantly different between urban and rural ecosystems.
   The phenology of hoverflies differed between the two ecosystems, with an
   earlier appearance in the year of migratory species in urban landscapes.
   Main conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to
   investigate the response of migratory insect communities to
   urbanization. We demonstrated that migratory and non-migratory
   hoverflies respond differently to urbanization. This highlights the
   importance of differentiating between trait and mobility groups to
   understand community assemblage patterns in anthropogenic landscapes.
   The differences in phenology supports the growing evidence that
   urbanization not only affects the phenology of vegetation, but also
   affects the higher trophic levels. Changes in the phenology and
   community composition of species as a result of anthropogenic landscape
   change may have important implications for the maintenance of key
   ecosystem functions, such as pollination.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1759-1768}},

Abstract = {{1. Large flower plantings are often used to combat negative effects of
   habitat loss on pollinators, but whether these floral additions are
   effective at smaller scales remains unclear, particularly in urban
   settings.
   2. To test the effectiveness of small-scale floral additions on
   enhancing urban bee populations, as well as their impact from 1 year to
   the next, different quantities of potted sweet alyssum (Lobularia
   maritima) flowers were placed across sites in Ann Arbor, Michigan for
   two consecutive years and the resulting Halictid bee visitors were
   monitored.
   3. Overall, we found the number of flowers added at the local level was
   significantly and positively correlated with small Halictid bee
   abundance and species density in an urban landscape. At smaller flower
   quantities, dynamics were clearly linear, where incremental increases in
   number of flowers showed significant increases in bee abundance and
   species density. At larger quantities of floral additions, however,
   dynamics were nonlinear in that incremental increases in flower quantity
   had no effect on bee abundance and highly variable effects on bee
   species density.
   4. When comparing the change in small Halictid bee abundance and species
   density from 1 year to the next, we found a significant increase in bee
   species density in the second year of small-scale floral additions, but
   no significant difference in bee abundance.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that small flower
   plantings can have positive effects on small bee communities in urban
   systems even over a short period of time and therefore confirm that
   encouraging citizens to plant flowers can be an effective conservation
   strategy for certain urban pollinator populations. In addition, our
   finding that smaller flower plantings may have higher impacts on small
   pollinators than larger plantings suggests resource managers interested
   in pollinator conservation should consider spreading multiple, smaller
   floral plantings across the urban landscape, rather than pooling all
   resources into one large flower patch.}},

Abstract = {{Rootstocks influence certain characteristics of the scion, such as
   vigor, fruit yield and quality, and tolerance to biotic and abiotic
   factors. In conventional citrus breeding programs, hybridization is the
   main method used for obtaining rootstock varieties. Between Sept and Oct
   2006, controlled pollinations were carried out resulting in nine
   progenies, totaling 461 hybrid seedlings. The female parents were the
   `Santa Cruz Rangpur' lime (SCRL) and the `Sunki of Florida' mandarin
   (SFM), while the male parents, in addition to this mandarin, were the
   `Indio' and `Riverside' citrandarins, the `Thomasville' citrangequat
   (THOM), the `Swingle' citrumelo, the `Argentina' citrange (AGC) and the
   `Benecke' trifoliate orange (BKTO). Fruit setting rates of these crosses
   were measured and the hybrids generated were planted in the field in
   2008 and evaluated from 2010 to 2014, for the variables of plant
   mortality, visual vigor, plant height and trunk diameter. The
   descriptive statistics mean, variation range, coefficient of variation
   and Pearson skewness coefficient were calculated. Data were submitted to
   analysis of variance and the means of the treatments were grouped by the
   Scott-Knott test, both at 5 \% significance. The progenies, having the
   `Sunki' mandarin as the female parent, presented higher fruit setting
   rates and lower plant mortality rates than those obtained from the
   female parent `Rangpur' lime, while zero plant mortality was observed in
   the SFM x BKTO cross. The crosses SCRL x SFM, SFM x BKTO, SFM x AGC and

Abstract = {{A pressing issue for mankind is how to combine urban expansion and food
   production for present and future generations. Using a case study
   example -the Stockholm County in Sweden-we illustrate how incorporating
   an ecosystem service perspective into urban planning may help us rethink
   the urban-rural divide in order to facilitate a sustainable development
   of the urban agricultural landscape of Stockholm. In our case study we
   show that semi-natural pollinator habitats will be 12 times as affected
   by the planned urban expansion than farmland. Hence, the fate and
   management of semi-natural pollinator habitats need to be prioritized at
   least as much as saving productive areas for farming in the urban
   expansion process. We also show that urban green areas, through their
   potential to act as semi-natural habitats, provide a tangible link
   between the pollination service and the urban planning process,
   contributing to a better grounding of the urban expansion in an
   ecosystem service reality. Also, acknowledging that land use types
   typically classified as ``urban{''}, such as urban green areas, can
   ecologically support many ``rural{''} ecosystem services, like
   pollination and food production, contributes to overcoming the, often
   unconstructive, urban-rural divide.
   We conclude that beneath the apparent direct trade-offs between finding
   suitable land for urban expansion and preserving land for food
   production, there is potential for compromises, opportunities and
   synergies.}},

Abstract = {{Tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima) is an invasive species in North
   America that is becoming widespread in the eastern part of the
   continent. In the drier, western interior of North America, however, the
   spread of tree-of-heaven appears to be limited to areas where
   supplemental water is available such as in urban areas or in riparian
   environments. To explore the effect of summer drought on tree-of-heaven
   seedlings and to look for genetic variation for drought tolerance among
   half-sibling families, we collected samaras from 12 open-pollinated
   mother trees growing in Utah County, Utah, and measured the samaras'
   area, maximum width, length, and weight. We then planted 10 samaras per
   mother tree into 10-cm pots in the greenhouse, measured the height of
   each resulting seedling, and randomly assigned them to a watering
   treatment (well-watered or droughted) that lasted for 20 wk. We examined
   the relationship between tree-of-heaven samara size parameters and
   seedling height before we started our drought treatment and for
   additional growth parameters after our drought treatment. Several growth
   parameters (relative growth, final height, final dry mass, final stem
   dry mass, final dry root mass, and root-to-shoot ratios) were reduced
   significantly by drought but differed among seedlings from different
   mothers only for relative growth. There was no genetic variation for
   drought tolerance observed for any of the growth parameters. These
   results suggest that tree-of-heaven seedlings from this part of western
   North America are uniformly and negatively affected by drought and may
   explain the relative dearth of tree-of-heaven in the interior West.}},

Abstract = {{Prior studies have largely focused on socioeconomic and demographic
   correlates of neighborhood crime rates. A largely distinct literature
   has highlighted the criminogenic influence of the built environment.
   Recent research cross-pollinated these literatures and demonstrated
   that, controlling for structural socioeconomic disadvantage, an
   aggregated neighborhood risk of crime (ANROC) measure capturing the
   influence of the built environment has a strong and robust influence on
   neighborhood crime rates. Instead of viewing variation in crime as a
   product of social factors or characteristics of the built environment,
   the current study advances the literature by exploring an interactive
   model viewing crime as a product of social factors and the built
   environment. Conceptually, we describe two distinct processes
   (attenuation and amplification) by which social structural sources of
   violence and characteristics of the environmental backcloth may
   interact. In assessing the salience of these processes, the current
   study provides a more accurate assessment of how divergent ecological
   contexts work contemporaneously to influence neighborhood levels of
   crime. Results of our block-group level analyses of a single city
   indicate structural disadvantage is an exceptionally robust predictor of
   crime, but the influence of the ANROC measure is contingent upon levels
   of socioeconomic disadvantage in the neighborhood at-large.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization represents a rapidly growing driver of land-use change.
   While it is clear that urbanization impacts species abundance and
   diversity, direct effects of urban land use on animal reproductive
   success are rarely documented. Here, we show that urban land use is
   linked to long-term colony reproductive output in a key pollinator. We
   reared colonies from wild-caught bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) queens,
   placed them at sites characterized by varying degrees of urbanization
   from inner city to rural farmland and monitored the production of sexual
   offspring across the entire colony cycle. Our land-use cluster analysis
   identified three site categories, and this categorization was a strong
   predictor of colony performance. Crucially, colonies in the two clusters
   characterized by urban development produced more sexual offspring than
   those in the cluster dominated by agricultural land. These colonies also
   reached higher peak size, had more food stores, encountered fewer
   parasite invasions and survived for longer. Our results show a link
   between urbanization and bumblebee colony reproductive success,
   supporting the theory that urban areas provide a refuge for pollinator
   populations in an otherwise barren agricultural landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use changes, pollution and climate warming during the 20th century
   have caused changes in biodiversity across the world. However, in many
   cases, the environmental drivers are poorly understood. To identify and
   rank the drivers currently causing broad-scale floristic changes in N
   Europe, we analysed data from two vascular plant surveys of 200 randomly
   selected 2.5 x 2.5 km grid-squares in Scania, southernmost Sweden,
   conducted 1989-2006 and 2008-2015, respectively, and related the change
   in frequency (performance) of the species to a wide range of
   species-specific plant traits. We chose traits representing all
   plausible drivers of recent floristic changes: climatic change (northern
   distribution limit, flowering time), land-use change (light requirement,
   response to grazing/mowing,response to soil disturbance), drainage
   (water requirement), acidification (pH optimum), nitrogen deposition and
   eutrophication (N requirement, N fixation ability, carnivory,
   parasitism, mycorrhizal associations), pollinator decline (mode of
   reproduction) and changes in CO2 levels (photosynthetic pathway). Our
   results suggest that climate warming and changes in land-use were the
   main drivers of changes in the flora during the last decades. Climate
   warming appeared as the most influential driver, with northern
   distribution limit explaining 30\%-60\% of the variance in the GLMM
   models. However, the relative importance of the drivers differed among
   habitat types, with grassland species being affected the most by
   cessation of grazing/mowing and species of ruderal habitats by on-going
   concentration of both agriculture and human population to the most
   productive soils. For wetland species, only pH optimum was significantly
   related to species performance, possibly an effect of the increasing
   humification of acidic water bodies. An observed relative decline of
   mycorrhizal species may possibly be explained by decreasing nitrogen
   deposition resulting in less competition for phosphorus. We found no
   effect of shortage or decline of pollinating lepidopterans and bees.}},

Abstract = {{Gibberellins (GA) and auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) are considered
   the main compounds involved in the induction of fruit set. Citrus trees
   flower profusely but exhibit dramatically low fruit set rates and, in
   particular, seeded orange cultivars also require pollination for fruit
   to adequately set. Consequently, they represent an excellent model to
   investigate the interactions between both hormones and their effect on
   fruit set and development. Unpollinated ovaries from `Pineapple' sweet
   orange trees were treated with IAA and pollinated ones with TIBA
   (2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid, inhibitor of auxin transport), and changes
   in ovaries were registered shortly after the treatments. The highest IAA
   levels were found in unpollinated ovaries treated with auxin (twofold
   increase compared to pollinated ones), and the lowest corresponded to
   pollinated ones supplemented with TIBA (30\% reduction). GA content also
   differed substantially among samples. In general, expression of the
   GA-biosynthetic gene GA20ox2 in the ovule and pericarp paralleled the
   changes in GA(20) content in both tissues, and also expression of GA3ox1
   and GA(1) content but only in the ovule. The levels of these GA in
   unpollinated ovaries were promoted in response to exogenous IAA, whereas
   expression of the GA-inactivation gene GA2ox1 and the concentration of
   the GA-catabolite GA(8) were reduced by this treatment. Significantly,
   treatments with GA(3) or IAA to unpollinated ovaries recovered fruit set
   to the level reached by free pollinated ones. Our study demonstrates
   that IAA alters GA metabolism in citrus leading to marked changes in the
   active GA(1) levels in ovules and pericarp, mainly through the
   regulation of GA-biosynthetic genes and the inhibition of the catabolic
   pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Hedgerows, flowering strips, and natural areas that are adjacent to
   agricultural land have been shown to benefit crop production, via the
   provision of insect pollinators that pollinate crops. However, we do not
   yet know the extent to which bee habitat in the form of urban gardens
   might contribute to pollination services in surrounding crops. We
   explored whether gardens might provision pollinators to adjacent
   agricultural areas by sampling bees from gardens in the Portland, Oregon
   metropolitan area, and estimating typical foraging distances in the
   context of commercial- and residential-scale pollination-dependent crops
   up to 1000 m from garden study sites. We estimate that garden bees could
   forage outside of the garden in which they were collected, and that when
   pollination-dependent crops (commercial-scale or residential-scale) are
   nearby, 30-50\% of the garden bee community could potentially provide
   pollination services to adjacent crops, if urban bees readily cross
   boundaries and forage among habitat types. Urban gardens might thus be
   well-positioned to provision neighboring farms and food gardens with
   pollination services, or could serve as a refuge for pollinators when
   forage is scarce or crop management practices are inhospitable. The
   actual capacity of gardens to serve as a refuge for pollinators from
   agricultural fields depends upon the extent to which bees forage across
   habitat types. However, relatively little is known about the degree to
   which bees move among habitat patches in heterogeneous landscapes. We
   thus propose a research agenda that can document the extent to which
   gardens contribute to pollinator health and pollination services at the
   interface of urban, peri-urban, and rural landscapes. In particular,
   more data is needed on how landscape context impedes or promotes garden
   bee movement between habitat types.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2018}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the relative importance of vacant lot and urban farm
   habitat features and their surrounding landscape context on bee
   community richness, abundance, composition, and resource use patterns.
   Three years of pan trap collections from 16 sites yielded a rich
   assemblage of bees from vacant lots and urban farms, with 98 species
   documented. We collected a greater bee abundance from vacant lots, and
   the two forms of greenspace supported significantly different bee
   communities. Plant-pollinator networks constructed from floral
   visitation observations revealed that, while the average number of bees
   utilizing available resources, niche breadth, and niche overlap were
   similar, the composition of floral resources and common foragers varied
   by habitat type. Finally, we found that the proportion of impervious
   surface and number of greenspace patches in the surrounding landscape
   strongly influenced bee assemblages. At a local scale (100 m radius),
   patch isolation appeared to limit colonization of vacant lots and urban
   farms. However, at a larger landscape scale (1000 m radius), increasing
   urbanization resulted in a greater concentration of bees utilizing
   vacant lots and urban farms, illustrating that maintaining greenspaces
   provides important habitat, even within highly developed landscapes.}},

   density}},
Journal = {{URBAN ECOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{419-428}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As cities expand, conservation of beneficial insects is essential to
   maintaining robust urban ecosystem services such as pollination. Urban
   warming alters insect physiology, fitness, and abundance, but the effect
   of urban warming on pollinator communities has not been investigated. We
   sampled bees at 18 sites encompassing an urban warming mosaic within
   Raleigh, NC, USA. We quantified habitat variables at all sites by
   measuring air temperature, percent impervious surface (on local and
   landscape scales), floral density, and floral diversity. We tested the
   hypothesis that urban bee community structure depends on temperature. We
   also conducted model selection to determine whether temperature was
   among the most important predictors of urban bee community structure.
   Finally, we asked whether bee responses to temperature or impervious
   surface depended on bee functional traits. Bee abundance declined by
   about 41\% per A degrees C urban warming, and temperature was among the
   best predictors of bee abundance and community composition. Local
   impervious surface and floral density were also important predictors of
   bee abundance, although only large bees appeared to benefit from high
   floral density. Bee species richness increased with floral density
   regardless of bee size, and bee responses to urban habitat variables
   were independent of other life-history traits. Although we document
   benefits of high floral density, simply adding flowers to otherwise hot,
   impervious sites is unlikely to restore the entire urban pollinator
   community since floral resources benefit large bees more than small
   bees.}},

Abstract = {{Green roofs are potentially valuable habitats for plants and animals in
   urban areas. Wild bees are important pollinators for crops and wild
   plants and may be enhanced by anthropogenic structures, but little is
   known about wild bees on green roofs in cities. This study investigates
   the effects of green roof qualities (floral resources, substrate
   character and depth, roof height and age) on wild bee diversity,
   abundance and traits (nesting type, sociality, pollen specialisation,
   body size) on green roofs in Vienna. Nine green roofs were sampled
   monthly between March and September 2014 by a semi quantitative
   approach. Wild bees were collected in pre-defined sub-areas for the same
   amount of time and floral resources were recorded. Over all green roofs,
   992 individuals belonging to 90 wild bee species were observed. Wild bee
   diversity and abundance was strongly positively affected by increasing
   forage availability and fine substrates. Wild bees on roofs were
   characteristically solitary, polylectic and 8.3-11.2 mm. Regarding
   nesting type, the percentage of above-ground nesting bees was higher
   compared to the common species composition in Middle Europe.
   Ground-nesting wild bees were mainly eusocial, smaller (6.4-9.6 mm) and
   positively affected by roofs with fine substrates. During June, when
   forage availability by wildflowers on roofs was ``low{''} (5-15\% flower
   coverage), flowering Sedum species were an important forage resource. We
   conclude that wild bee diversity and abundance on green roofs are
   enhanced by floral resources. Furthermore, the installations of areas
   with finer and deeper substrates benefit ground nesting and eusocial
   wild bees.}},

   Environments across Two US Regions}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Urban agroecosystems offer an opportunity to investigate the diversity
   and distribution of organisms that are conserved in city landscapes.
   This information is not only important for conservation efforts, but
   also has important implications for sustainable agricultural practices.
   Associated biodiversity can provide ecosystem services like pollination
   and pest control, but because organisms may respond differently to the
   unique environmental filters of specific urban landscapes, it is
   valuable to compare regions that have different abiotic conditions and
   urbanization histories. In this study, we compared the abundance and
   diversity of ladybird beetles within urban gardens in California and
   Michigan, USA. We asked what species are shared, and what species are
   unique to urban regions. Moreover, we asked how beetle diversity is
   influenced by the amount and rate of urbanization surrounding sampled
   urban gardens. We found that the abundance and diversity of beetles,
   particularly of unique species, respond in opposite directions to
   urbanization: ladybirds increased with urbanization in California, but
   decreased with urbanization in Michigan. We propose that in California
   water availability in gardens and the urbanization history of the
   landscape could explain the divergent pattern. Thus, urban context is
   likely a key contributor to biodiversity within habitats and an
   important consideration for sustainable agricultural practices in urban
   agroecosystems.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Approximately 35\% of all crop production is dependent on
   animal-mediated pollination. Many wild bee species are declining rapidly
   across North America and Europe, a potential consequence of land-use
   change driven by agricultural intensification and urbanization. In this
   study we assessed the impact of urbanization on the reproductive success
   and population growth rate of bumblebees in an urbanization gradient. We
   placed experimental nests in ten sites; all except one were community
   gardens, ranging from a 0-99\% degree of urbanization. Reproductive
   success and colony size were positively correlated with cumulative
   weight gain of the nests (p < 0.05). We did not find an effect of
   urbanization on the population growth rate of the nests or on forager
   activity (p > 0.05). Growth rate was strongly negatively affected by the
   abundance of wax moth larvae (p < 0.05) and positively correlated with
   parasite diversity (p < 0.05) and the number of foragers entering the
   nest (p < 0.01). With this study we show that not only bottom-up but
   also top-down effects are equally important for pollinator population
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Biological communities are increasingly faced with novel urban habitats
   and their response may depend on a combination of biological and habitat
   traits. The response of pollinator species to urban habitats are of
   particular importance because all species involved in the pollination
   mutualism may be affected. Nectarivorous bird communities worldwide show
   varying tolerances to urban areas, but studies from Africa are lacking.
   We investigated nectarivorous bird communities in a medium-sized South
   African city and asked which biological and garden traits best predict
   the community assembly of specialist and opportunistic nectarivorous
   birds. Information was collected on garden traits and the frequency of
   nine nectarivorous bird species for 193 gardens by means of a
   questionnaire. Information on biological traits of birds was obtained
   from published literature. Habitat generalism and tree nesting were
   identified as the most important biological traits influencing bird
   occurrence in gardens. A greater diversity of indigenous bird-pollinated
   plants and the presence of sugar water feeders increased the numbers of
   nectar specialist birds and species richness of nectarivorous birds.
   While bird baths increased the species richness of nectar specialist
   birds, opportunistic birds' urban adjustment was further facilitated by
   large vegetated areas in gardens and limited by the distance to the
   nearest natural habitat. In conclusion, though some biological traits
   and dispersal barriers seem to limit urban adjustment, a combination of
   natural and artificial nectar resource provisioning could facilitate
   this adjustment.}},

Title = {{A land classification protocol for pollinator ecology research: An
   urbanization case study}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{5598-5610}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Land-use change is one of the most important drivers of widespread
   declines in pollinator populations. Comprehensive quantitative methods
   for land classification are critical to understanding these effects, but
   co-option of existing human-focussed land classifications is often
   inappropriate for pollinator research. Here, we present a flexible
   GIS-based land classification protocol for pollinator research using a
   bottom-up approach driven by reference to pollinator ecology, with
   urbanization as a case study. Our multistep method involves manually
   generating land cover maps at multiple biologically relevant radii
   surrounding study sites using GIS, with a focus on identifying land
   cover types that have a specific relevance to pollinators. This is
   followed by a three-step refinement process using statistical tools: (i)
   definition of land-use categories, (ii) principal components analysis on
   the categories, and (iii) cluster analysis to generate a categorical
   land-use variable for use in subsequent analysis. Model selection is
   then used to determine the appropriate spatial scale for analysis. We
   demonstrate an application of our protocol using a case study of 38
   sites across a gradient of urbanization in South-East England. In our
   case study, the land classification generated a categorical land-use
   variable at each of four radii based on the clustering of sites with
   different degrees of urbanization, open land, and flower-rich habitat.
   Studies of land-use effects on pollinators have historically employed a
   wide array of land classification techniques from descriptive and
   qualitative to complex and quantitative. We suggest that land-use
   studies in pollinator ecology should broadly adopt GIS-based multistep
   land classification techniques to enable robust analysis and aid
   comparative research. Our protocol offers a customizable approach that
   combines specific relevance to pollinator research with the potential
   for application to a wide range of ecological questions, including
   agroecological studies of pest control.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{Distinguishing between the ecosystems' capacity to generate ecosystem
   services (ES) and the actual use of these service (ES flow) in ES
   assessment and mapping is important to develop an understanding of the
   sustainability of ES use. This study assesses the spatial variation in
   ES capacity and flow in the Mediterranean small island state of Malta.
   The services included in this study were crop provisioning, beekeeping
   and honey production, fodder and livestock production, crop pollination,
   air quality regulation, and aesthetic ES. This assessment develops
   different spatial models, which make use of available datasets, causal
   relationships between datasets, including a generated land use land
   cover (LULC) map, and statistical models and indicators based on direct
   measurements. Individual ES indicators were mapped to visualise and
   compare their spatial patterns across the case study area. Subsequently,
   an analysis of ES associations and bundles was carried out using Pearson
   parametric correlation test, for both ES capacity and flow indicators
   generated from this study, and through Principal Component Analysis.
   Results demonstrate several significant synergistic interactions between
   ES capacity and flow in rural landscapes characterised with agricultural
   and semi-natural LULC categories, indicating high landscape multi
   functionality. In contrast, predominantly urban areas tend to be
   characterised with a low ecosystem capacity and ES flow, suggesting that
   ES delivery in the landscapes of the study area is determined by land
   use intensity. These findings support the notion that multifunctional
   rural landscapes provide multiple ES, making an important contribution
   to human well-being, and that land use planning that develops green
   infrastructure in urban areas can significantly contribute to support
   biodiversity and ES delivery.}},

Title = {{Optimizing the allocation of agri-environment measures to navigate the
   trade-offs between ecosystem services, biodiversity and agricultural
   production}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{186-196}},

Abstract = {{Demands on peri-urban landscapes are increasing and diversifying. These
   landscapes typically fulfil different functions, including agriculture,
   ecosystem services and may also host species and habitats of
   conservation concern. Designing landscapes that can simultaneously meet
   multiple competing demands is an important challenge. Addressing this
   challenge requires methods that can provide a clear understanding of the
   trade-offs between biodiversity, production and ecosystem services, and
   that can assist in effectively navigating these through planning. Here,
   we tested the degree to which landscape optimization algorithms can do
   so, for an intensively-used area in the Netherlands. We optimized land
   use/land management to increase fruit yield, endangered species habitat,
   and landscape aesthetics, while minimizing losses in dairy farming, and
   assessed the trade-offs among these objectives. We considered the
   allocation of on-farm measures (organic management and establishment of
   linear elements), off-farm measures (taking land out of production) and
   a combination of both. Both agri-environment measures were able to
   contribute to the objectives but showed strong trade-offs between fruit
   yield (on-farm: +26.19\% vs. off-farm: +1.63\%) and species habitat
   (on-farm: +9.90\% vs. off-farm: +45.72\%). Using a combination of both
   on-farm and off-farm measures largely alleviated this trade-off. The
   spatial allocation of measures in the landscape was important, and
   priority areas according to our optimization technique differed markedly
   from those in the existing nature conservation plan, which is primarily
   focused on species conservation. Our results highlight that the current
   nature conservation plan can be improved, thereby simultaneously
   contributing to multiple environmental objectives while incurring a
   smaller impact on dairy fanning. Comparing on-farm and off-farm
   management practices provides insight in the functional trade-offs
   associated with each management option and their respective potential to
   increase multifunctionality. Moreover, the identification of priority
   locations across all solutions can further integrate landscape
   optimization approaches into spatial planning and inform policy design
   and implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive evolution of invasive species is both particularly exciting for
   the evolutionary biologist and worrisome for those interested in
   controlling or halting spread. Invasive species often have a distinct
   timeline and well-recorded population expansion. As invaders encounter
   new environments, they undergo rapid adaptive evolution. Our aim in this
   study was to measure variation of floral size in the invasive shrub
   Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) and measure natural selection by
   pollinators on that trait. Past research has found that this invasive
   plant is pollinator limited in Washington State and that declines in
   pollinator populations can contribute to local extinction in another
   invaded range (New Zealand). This plant is pollinated by both native and
   introduced species of bees, representing a broad range of pollinator
   sizes. Cytisus scoparius has a flower structure that is highly conducive
   to studies on pollinator choice, even in the absence of direct
   pollinator observations.
   We surveyed urban and rural sites in and around the city of Olympia in
   Washington State. Measuring banner width, we were able to show that
   flower size varies substantially between plants but minimally within
   plants. By measuring the proportion of flowers that were `tripped', we
   could determine pollinator visitation rates and thus determine the level
   of selection due to pollinator choice alone.
   We found that C. scoparius is under natural selection by pollinators for
   increased flower size. However, such positive natural selection was only
   seen in urban populations although it was consistent across two
   flowering seasons. Rural populations of Scotch broom do not appear to be
   under selection on flower size. The natural selection by pollinators on
   broom flowers could result in adaptive evolution into a new pollination
   niche by an invading species. A higher level of variation in broom
   flowers seen here than seen in previous works in native regions suggests
   that C. scoparius may be highly diverse and primed for adaptive
   evolution.}},

   including the Lucayan Archipelago, the Cayman Islands and Cozumel
   Island. Individuals of L. vanessablockae have been collected on the
   Cayman endemic banana orchid (Myrmecophila thomsoniana (Orchidaceae)),
   which represents the first reported occurrence of Lachnopus weevils as
   pollinators. In addition, we present an annotated checklist of the
   species of Lachnopus, including collecting localities, host plants, and
   biological notes obtained from the literature or collection data from
   labels of collections' specimens. Lachnopus coffeae Marshall, 1922 is
   recorded for the first time for Grand Bahama, which appears to be an
   introduction associated with citrus from Puerto Rico. We also list the
   fossil species attributed to the genus. Comments on some morphological
   characters and their variation across the genus are included.
   Species-groups within the genus are proposed, including diagnostic
   features to recognize them. Some taxonomic conflicts found in

Abstract = {{Bats provide important ecosystem services such as pollination of native
   forests; they are also a source of zoonotic pathogens for humans and
   domestic animals. Human-induced changes to native habitats may have
   created more opportunities for bats to reside in urban settings, thus
   decreasing pollination services to native forests and increasing
   opportunities for zoonotic transmission. In Australia, fruit bats
   (Pteropus spp. flying foxes) are increasingly inhabiting urban areas
   where they feed on anthropogenic food sources with nutritional
   characteristics and phenology that differ from native habitats. We use
   optimal foraging theory to investigate the relationship between bat
   residence time in a patch, the time it takes to search for a new patch
   (simulating loss of native habitat) and seasonal resource production. We
   show that it can be beneficial to reside in a patch, even when food
   productivity is low, as long as foraging intensity is low and the
   expected searching time is high. A small increase in the expected patch
   searching time greatly increases the residence time, suggesting
   nonlinear associations between patch residence and loss of seasonal
   native resources. We also found that sudden increases in resource
   consumption due to an influx of new bats has complex effects on patch
   departure times that again depend on expected searching times and
   seasonality. Our results suggest that the increased use of urban
   landscapes by bats may be a response to new spatial and temporal
   configurations of foraging opportunities. Given that bats are reservoir
   hosts of zoonotic diseases, our results provide a framework to study the
   effects of foraging ecology on disease dynamics.

Abstract = {{Accelerating pressures to accommodate rapidly increasing human
   populations in Australia pose major problems for insect conservation in
   urban and periurban regions from loss of natural habitats, alien species
   impacts and a variety of other causes. Several urban insects have become
   notable flagships for promoting wider conservation interests, leading to
   wider appreciation of environmental benefits of `open spaces', urban
   forests, connectivity, `green architecture' and other landscape features
   as relevant planning considerations in urban development. Their
   conservation, under a range of ecological contexts and threats, occurs
   in conjunction with energetic advocacy and educational programs that can
   emphasise the roles and diversity of Australia's unique insect fauna.
   Approaches to conserving native insects amidst urban intensification are
   discussed from selected case studies and citizen science projects that
   illustrate principles and complexities of single-species conservation,
   the values of indicator and diversity surrogate taxa and the
   implications of alien species on native insect diversity and its losses
   in urban environments. Important lessons and implications include the
   following: (1) recognition that taxonomic and ecological diversity of
   insects can be high in urban areas; (2) acknowledgment that insect
   diversity in urban environments is vulnerable to changes and a variety
   of threatening processes; (3) mitigation responses that involve reducing
   threats, preserving open spaces with natural vegetation, creating new
   open areas and promoting connectivity; (4) establishment of partnerships
   that enhance conservation values and prospects through individual
   people, local authorities and government agencies; and (5) increasing
   awareness of insects as integral components of ecological sustainability
   contributing to the wider values of urban environments.}},

Title = {{To mow or to mow less: Lawn mowing frequency affects bee abundance and
   diversity in suburban yards}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{221}},
Pages = {{160-174}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Green spaces embedded within the urban matrix, particularly residential
   yards, could mitigate negative aspects of urban development and provide
   pollinator habitat. Lawns represent a dominant green space, and their
   management consists of frequent mowing to inhibit the growth of
   ostensibly ``weedy{''} species (e.g., dandelions and clover). Since
   widespread population declines of bees and other pollinators from
   habitat loss are a growing concern, these spontaneous flowers could
   provide pollen and nectar sources throughout the growing season. We
   experimentally tested whether different lawn mowing frequencies (1, 2 or
   3 weeks) influenced bee abundance and diversity in 16 suburban western
   Massachusetts yards by increasing lawn floral resources. Lawns mowed
   every three weeks had as much as 2.5 times more lawn flowers than the
   other frequencies. Interestingly, lawns mowed every two weeks supported
   the highest bee abundance yet the lowest bee richness and evenness. We
   suggest these patterns were driven by a combination of more abundant
   floral resources (compared with 1-week yards), easier access to lawn
   flowers due to shorter grass and a more drastic impact on grass biomass
   and floral resources (compared with 3-week yards), and the dominance of
   a few generalist bees overwhelming our samples, thus driving richness
   and evenness. Our results highlight a ``lazy lawnmower{''} approach to
   providing bee habitat. Mowing less frequently is practical, economical,
   and a timesaving alternative to lawn replacement or even planting
   pollinator gardens. Given the pervasiveness of lawns coupled with
   habitat loss, our findings provide immediate solutions for individual
   households to contribute to urban conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Urban green areas, due to their high plant diversity, can be supportive
   as floral resources (nectar and/or pollen) to wild and managed
   pollinating insects. This research aims towards understanding the
   contribution of ornamental ground cover perennials as a food source for
   urban pollinators. We compare floral phenology and abundance, nectar and
   pollen production, and insect visitation to flowers of Geranium
   macrorrhizum, G. platypetalum and G. sanguineum, planted in the
   botanical garden of Lublin, SE Poland. The investigation revealed that
   the studied hardy geraniums exhibit many features valuable for
   pollinators, including large floral display (G. macrorrhizum and G.
   platypetalum), extended flowering period (G. sanguineum) and ample
   nectar and pollen reward (G. macrorrhizum). They can supply urban
   pollinators with a high quality food during spring and early summer
   time, i.e. the period of high food demand by many bee species. Moreover,
   hardy geraniums might be valuable plants for urban beekeeping as they
   are eagerly visited by honeybees. The investigated ground cover plants
   could therefore be considered in future city plantings.}},

Month = {{MAY-AUG}},
Abstract = {{The loss, fragmentation and degradation of natural and semi-natural
   habitats due to land-use changes is one of the fundamental causes of
   worldwide pollinator declines. In this paper, we review how land-use
   changes affect wild native pollinator insects, as well as the particular
   effects of the three main types of land-use (agriculture, livestock
   grazing and urbanization) on pollinator abundance and diversity,
   plant-pollinator networks, and pollination service. Land-use changes may
   vary in intensity, but all of them involve habitat disturbances
   affecting pollinator populations, especially through modification of
   their floral and nesting resources. In general, regardless of the
   land-use type, changes whose intensity increases the availability of
   resources and the heterogeneity of microhabitats tend to have positive
   effects on the abundance and diversity of pollinators, whereas changes
   that reduce resource availability usually have negative effects.
   Moreover, the response of pollinators depends on their specific traits
   (specialization, mobility, sociability, nesting site, phenology). Some
   species or groups may be favoured while others disadvantaged by
   different land-uses. Although the negative effects of land-use changes
   are ubiquitous, anthropogenic habitats may still be suitable for
   pollinators if appropriate conservation, restoration and management
   measures are taken.}},

Abstract = {{Nature conservation and social equity issues have been approached in a
   myriad of ways by conservation, humanitarian, and development
   practitioners. The rapid and shifting urbanization of the globe makes
   the interaction of these issues paramount and it is imperative to
   articulate pathways to harmonizing these relationships readily followed
   by conservation practitioners. We describe the processes and compare the
   resulting social equity and conservation objectives of two initiatives
   purposefully integrating these approaches. A private nonprofit seeking
   to develop an urban conservation program in the Atlanta metropolitan
   area purposefully engaged residents from surrounding communities and
   self-identified local and sector leaders to identify communities where
   social equity and conservation objectives could be created together. A
   public agency, built on a century-long history of environmental
   stewardship for migratory birds and pollinators, integrated 20 years of
   participatory action research to engage the surrounding communities
   using methods suggested and developed by the communities themselves. In
   both cases, community-based research approaches have helped establish
   cocreated objectives and flexible monitoring and evaluation baselines.
   Both initiatives found a need to appropriately resource and train staff
   to remain open to learning and evolving new objectives as additional
   perspectives emerge and the impact on conservation and equity objectives
   is assessed.}},

Journal = {{URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{92-98}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Urban parks are biodiversity reservoirs and provide ecosystem services
   within cities. They regulate temperature, reduce noise and increase
   water infiltration. As biodiversity reservoirs, they allow the animals
   that inhabit them to provide other services, such as pollination, pest
   control, and the decomposition of organic material. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate the effect of vegetation cover in urban parks on
   arthropod biomass, the density of vertebrates and the removal of human
   food waste by animals. Eleven parks with different amounts of vegetation
   cover were sampled. The arthropod biomass was obtained through pitfall
   traps; the density of vertebrates through footprint traps; and the
   removal of food through two experiments, one that allowed the
   vertebrates to remove food and one that did not. Animals were offered
   fried wheat, candy, corn cob and sausage. Whereas the number of
   vertebrate visits to footprint traps was not explained by the amount of
   vegetation cover, arthropod biomass was. Food removal, too, was
   positively related to the amount of vegetation cover, and the most food
   was removed in experiments that included vertebrates; sausage was the
   food removed most often in both experiments. These findings suggest that
   increasing park vegetation cover result in more area available to urban
   fauna, especially arthropods, allowing them to increase the food removal
   service.}},

Abstract = {{Urban species and habitats provide important ecosystem services such as
   summertime cooling, recreation, and pollination at a variety of scales.
   Many studies have assessed how biodiversity responds to urbanization,
   but little work has been done to try and create recommendations that can
   be easily applied to urban planning, design and management practice.
   Urban planning often operates at broad spatial scales, typically using
   relatively simplistic targets for land-cover mix to influence
   biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Would more complicated,
   but still easily created, prescriptions for urban vegetation be
   beneficial? Here we assess the importance of vegetation measures
   (percentage vegetation cover, tree canopy cover and variation in canopy
   height) across four taxonomic groups (bats, bees, hoverflies and birds)
   at multiple spatial scales (100, 250, 500, 1000 m) within a major urban
   area (Birmingham, the United Kingdom). We found that small-scale
   (100-250-m radius) measures of vegetation were important predictors for
   hoverflies and bees, and that bats were sensitive to vegetation at a
   medium spatial-scale (250-500 m). In contrast, birds responded to
   vegetation characteristics at both small (100 m) and large (1000 m)
   scales. Vegetation cover, tree cover and variation in canopy height were
   expected to decrease with built surface cover; however, only vegetation
   cover showed this expected trend. The results indicate the importance of
   relatively small patches of vegetationfor supporting urban biodiversity,
   and show that relatively simple measures of vegetation characteristics
   can be useful predictors of species richness (or activity density, in
   the case of bats). They also highlight the danger of relying upon
   percentage built surface cover as an indicator of urban biodiversity
   potential.}},

Abstract = {{Sexually deceptive orchids attract specific pollinators by mimicking
   insect sex pheromones. Normally this mimicry is very specific and
   identical compounds have been identified from orchids and matching
   females of the pollinators. In this study, we conduct a detailed
   structure-activity investigation on isomers of the semiochemicals
   involved in the sexual attraction of the male pollinator of the spider
   orchid Caladenia plicata. This orchid employs an unusual blend of two
   biosynthetically unrelated compounds, (S)-beta-citronellol and
   2-hydroxy-6-methylacetophenone, to lure its Zeleboria sp. thynnine wasp
   pollinator. We show that the blend is barely attractive when
   (S)-beta-citronellol is substituted with its enantiomer,
   (R)-beta-citronellol. Furthermore, none of the nine-possible alternative
   hydroxy-methylacetophenone regioisomers of the natural semiochemical are
   active when substituted for the natural 2-hydroxy-6-methylacetophenone.
   Our results were surprising given the structural similarity between the
   active compound and some of the analogues tested, and results from
   previous studies in other sexually deceptive orchid/wasp systems where
   substitution with analogues was possible. Interestingly, high-level ab
   initio and density functional theory calculations of the
   hydroxy-methylacetophenones revealed that the active natural isomer,
   2-hydroxy-6-methylacetophenone, has the strongest intramolecular
   hydrogen bond of all regioisomers, which at least in part may explain
   the specific activity.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{AimLeafcutter bees use plants as pollen and nectar sources, but also cut
   leaf discs and use them to line their nests. Which plant species they
   choose as nesting material and why they do so have remained obscure. We
   asked the following: (1) How are the plant species used by leafcutter
   bees distributed phylogenetically? (2) Does plant choice differ across
   geographical regions, and if so, in what ways? (3) Are the leaf plant
   species natives or exotics? (4) What plant and leaf traits predict
   selection of plant species by leafcutter bees? And (5) Does the
   abundance of individuals per species in the habitat influence leafcutter
   bees' plant preferences?
   LocationTropical South Asia, temperate eastern Canada and US Sonoran
   Desert
   MethodsWe mapped taxa known to be used by leafcutter bees both from our
   own study and published literature onto the most recent angiosperm
   phylogeny. To determine what plant and leaf traits predict leaf
   selection, we monitored 6,120 individuals of 214 native and exotic plant
   species planted in a 3-sq. km. arboretum in Arizona and recorded leaf
   damage inflicted by bees.
   ResultsMegachile showed a strong preference for species in the rosid
   clade, particularly the phylogenetic cluster of Fabales, Fagales and
   Rosales. Thirty-two to forty-five percentage of the leaf plant species
   were exotic to a given region. Membership in the rosid clade and
   Fabaceae family predicted plant preference, whereas the plant species'
   local abundance and geographical origin did not. Leaf water content,
   morphotype and the presence of latex were important factors influencing
   plant choice, whereas leaf shape and size did not.
   Main conclusionThese patterns point to plant groups whose availability
   should be monitored to assure persistence of leafcutter bees. Their
   preference for specific globally distributed plant clades, yet ability
   to readily adopt certain exotic plant species as nest resources, likely
   augments their ability to persist.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization is considered a global threat to biodiversity; the growth
   of cities results in an increase in impervious surfaces, soil and air
   pollution, fragmentation of natural vegetation and invasion of
   non-native species, along with numerous environmental changes, including
   the heat island phenomenon. The combination of these effects constitutes
   a challenge for both the survival and persistence of many native
   species, while also imposing altered selective regimes. Here, using
   110314 single nucleotide polymorphisms generated by
   restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing, we investigated the
   genome-wide effects of urbanization on putative neutral and adaptive
   genomic diversity in a major insect pollinator, Bombus lapidarius,
   collected from nine German cities and nine paired rural sites. Overall,
   genetic differentiation among sites was low and there was no obvious
   genome-wide genetic structuring, suggesting the absence of strong
   effects of urbanization on gene flow. We nevertheless identified several
   loci under directional selection, a subset of which was associated with
   urban land use, including the percentage of impervious surface
   surrounding each sampling site. Overall, our results provide evidence of
   local adaptation to urbanization in the face of gene flow in a highly
   mobile insect pollinator.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding stakeholder valuation of ecosystem services (ESs), and
   perceptions of threats to their conservation, can improve planning for
   urban protected areas. Our study objectives were to examine ES
   valuations by Rouge National Urban Park (NUP) users as well as
   perceptions of the impact of the invasive vine Vincetoxicum rossicum.
   Further, we sought to determine how those valuations and perceptions are
   affected by ``ecological engagement{''} (EE). We conducted a social
   survey of Rouge NUP users and found that valuation of most ESs was
   significantly greater for EE users. Interestingly, non-EE users tended
   to give recreation ('cultural' ES) the highest importance value.
   Conversely, EE users tended to assign pollination ('supporting' ES), the
   highest importance. Further, we were surprised to find that 15.2\% of EE
   and 38.4\% of non-EE users disagreed or were neutral to the notion that
   V. rossicum is negatively impacting the Park's supporting ESs.
   Similarly, 32\% of EE and 54.1\% of non-EE users disagreed or were
   neutral to the notion that V. rossicum is negatively impacting the
   Park's aesthetic ESs. We conclude that examination of EE can reveal
   differential ES valuations and perceptions of invasion impact.
   Furthermore, we believe such examination can inform conservation
   management plans and public engagement strategies. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Numbers of bumblebees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are decreasing in many
   European countries. Thirty-six species native to Poland are legally
   protected, and 19 are considered as threatened with extinction. A method
   for assessing the attractiveness of garden flowering plants for
   bumblebees was developed in this study. Observations were conducted
   through the growing seasons in 2011 and 2012 in two botanical gardens
   located in Wroclaw city, Poland. Bumblebees were observed and recorded
   on flowers during 30-min observations and determined to species level.
   An algorithm was used to define the attractiveness (Atp) of visited
   flowers, including the frequency of flower visits by bumblebees during
   phenological seasons. The resulting Atp values were assigned to a
   4-level scale of attractiveness. In the botanical garden, the most
   ``valuable'' plant species were: Rhododendron catawbiense Michaux,
   Lathyrus vernus Bentham, Lathyrus odoratus L., Aristolochia clematitis
   L., Cyanus montanus Hill, Aconitum lycoctonum L., Hosta sp., Spiraea
   japonica L. filius, Lavandula 3 intermedia Loiseleur-Deslongchamps, and
   Lavandula angustifolia Miller; and in the Medicinal Plants Botanical
   Garden there were: Geranium phaeum L., Agastache rugosa Kuntze,
   Glycyrrhiza glabra L., Cydonia oblonga Miller, R. catawbiense, Monarda
   didyma L., Aruncus dioicus Fernald, Lavandula angustifolia, Phacelia
   tanacetifolia Bentham, Origanum vulgare L., and Scutellaria baicalensis
   Georgi. The proposed algorithm may be useful in protecting bumblebees,
   which takes into account their nutritional needs or feeding behavior.
   Careful plant selection in planning green urban areas with high rates of
   Atp will likely to contribute to an increase in numbers of bumblebees.}},

Title = {{Restore it, and they will come: trap-nesting bee and wasp communities

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Riparian forests have been greatly affected by anthropogenic actions
   with formerly continuous riparian forests being slowly converted into
   small and isolated patches. Riparian forests are extremely important
   habitats for many groups of insects, including bees and wasps, because
   they are sources of shelter and food for them and their offspring. There
   is a growing body of evidence of success in the restoration of riparian
   forest plant communities; however, little research has been done on the
   associated invertebrate communities. We test whether restoring plant
   communities is sufficient for restoring the taxonomic composition of
   trap-nesting bees and wasps and which functional traits are favored in
   different sites. We predict that species richness, abundance, and
   community composition of trap-nesting bees and wasps of riparian sites
   undergoing restoration will converge on the ``target{''} of a reference
   site with increasing time, since restoration increases habitat
   complexity. We also predict that the width of restored patches will also
   influence the species richness, abundance and community composition of
   trap-nesting bees and wasps. Bee richness and abundance, and wasp
   richness, were strongly related to fragment width, but not to age since
   restoration. Our results indicate that although restored sites are
   relatively small and scattered in a fragmented landscape, they provide
   suitable habitat for re-colonization by community assemblages of
   trap-nesting bees and wasps and the traits selected captured the
   responses to the habitat restoration. Hence, restored riparian areas can
   be considered important habitats for invertebrates, thus contributing to
   an increase in local biodiversity and, possibly, the restoration of some
   of the ecosystem services they originally provided.}},

   using multivariate landscape metric analysis}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{557-573}},

Abstract = {{Landscape metrics represent powerful tools for quantifying landscape
   structure, but uncertainties persist around their interpretation. Urban
   settings add unique considerations, containing habitat structures driven
   by the surrounding built-up environment. Understanding urban ecosystems,
   however, should focus on the habitats rather than the matrix.
   We coupled a multivariate approach with landscape metric analysis to
   overcome existing shortcomings in interpretation. We then explored
   relationships between landscape characteristics and modelled ecosystem
   service provision.
   We used principal component analysis and cluster analysis to isolate the
   most effective measures of landscape variability and then grouped
   habitat patches according to their attributes, independent of the
   surrounding urban form. We compared results to the modelled provision of
   three ecosystem services. Seven classes resulting from cluster analysis
   were separated primarily on patch area, and secondarily by measures of
   shape complexity and inter-patch distance.
   When compared to modelled ecosystem services, larger patches up to 10 ha
   in size consistently stored more carbon per area and supported more
   pollinators, while exhibiting a greater risk of soil erosion. Smaller,
   isolated patches showed the opposite, and patches larger than 10 ha
   exhibited no additional areal benefit.
   Multivariate landscape metric analysis offers greater confidence and
   consistency than analysing landscape metrics individually. Independent
   classification avoids the influence of the urban matrix surrounding
   habitats of interest, and allows patches to be grouped according to
   their own attributes. Such a grouping is useful as it may correlate more
   strongly with the characteristics of landscape structure that directly
   affect ecosystem function.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators provide essential services for watermelon, Citrullus lanatus
   (Thunb.; Cucurbitales: Cucurbitaceae). Managed bumble bees, Bombus
   impatiens (Cresson; Hymenoptera: Apidae), have been shown to be a useful
   watermelon pollinator in some areas. However, the exact contribution
   bumble bees make to watermelon pollination and how their contribution
   compares to that of other bees is unclear. We used large cages (5.4 x
   2.5 x 2.4 m) to confine bumble bee hives to watermelon plants and
   compared fruit set in those cages to cages containing watermelons but no
   pollinators, and to open areas of field next to cages (allows all
   pollinators). We also collected data on single visit pollen deposition
   onto watermelon stigmas by managed bumble bees, honey bees, and wild
   bees. Overall, more fruit formed within the open cages than in cages of
   the other two treatment groups. B. impatiens and Melissodes spp.
   deposited the most pollen onto watermelon stigmas per visit, but all bee
   species observed visiting watermelon flowers were capable of depositing
   ample pollen to watermelon stigmas. Although B. impatiens did deposit
   large quantities of pollen to stigmas, they were not common within the
   field (i.e., outside the cages) as they were readily drawn to flowering
   plants outside of the watermelon field. Overall, bumble bees can
   successfully pollinate watermelon, but may be useful in greenhouses or
   high tunnels where watermelon flowers have no competition from other
   flowering plants that could draw bumble bees away from watermelon.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary ecologists seek to explain the processes that maintain
   variation within populations. In plants, petal color variation can
   affect pollinator visitation, environmental tolerance, and herbivore
   deterrence. Variation in sexual organs may similarly affect plant
   performance. Within-population variation in pollen color, as occurs in
   the eastern North American spring ephemeral Erythronium americanum,
   provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the maintenance of
   variation in this trait. Although the red/yellow pollen-color
   polymorphism of E.americanum is widely recognized, it has been poorly
   documented. Our goals were thus (1) to determine the geographic
   distribution of the color morphs and (2) to test the effects of pollen
   color on components of pollen performance. Data provided by citizen
   scientists indicated that populations range from monomorphic red, to
   polymorphic, to monomorphic yellow, but there was no detectable
   geographic pattern in morph distribution, suggesting morph occurrence
   cannot be explained by a broad-scale ecological cline. In field
   experiments, we found no effect of pollen color on the probability of
   predation by the pollen-feeding beetle Asclera ruficollis, on the
   ability of pollen to tolerate UV-B radiation, or on siring success (as
   measured by the fruit set of hand-pollinated flowers). Pollinators,
   however, exhibited site-specific pollen-color preferences, suggesting
   they may act as agents of selection on this trait, and, depending on the
   constancy of their preferences, could contribute to the maintenance of
   variation. Collectively, our results eliminate some hypothesized
   ecological effects of pollen color in E.americanum, and identify effects
   of pollen color on pollinator attraction as a promising direction for
   future investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The historical management of agroecological systems, such as
   California's rangelands, have received criticism for a singular focus on
   agricultural production goals, while society has shifting expectations
   to the supply of multiple ecosystem services from these working
   landscapes. The sustainability and the multiple benefits derived from
   these complex social-ecological systems is increasingly threatened by
   weed invasion, extreme disturbance, urban development, and the impacts
   of a rapidly changing and increasingly variable climate. California's
   grasslands, oak savannas, and oak woodlands are among the most invaded
   ecosystems in the world. Weed eradication efforts are rarely combined
   with seeding on these landscapes despite support for the inclusion of
   the practice in a weed management program. Depending on seed mix choice,
   cost and long-term uncertainty, especially for native seed, is an
   impediment to adoption by land managers. We investigated four seeding
   mixes (forage annual, native perennial, exotic perennial, and
   exotic-native perennial) to evaluate how these treatments resist
   reinvasion and support the delivery of simultaneous multiple ecosystem
   services (invasion resistance, native richness, nitrogen fixing plants,
   pollinator food sources, plant community diversity, forage quality, and
   productivity). We found the increase of exotic and native perennial
   cover will drive resistance to an invading weedy summer flowering forb
   Centaurea solstitialis but provides a mixed response to resisting
   invasive annual grasses. The resistance to invasion is coupled with
   little tradeoff in forage productivity and quality and gains in plant
   diversity and native cover. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Intense landscaping often alters the plant composition in
   urban areas. Knowing which plant species that pollinators are visiting
   in urban areas is necessary for understanding how landscaping impacts
   biodiversity and associated ecosystem services The cave nectar bat
   Eonycieris spelaca is an important pollinator for many plants and is
   often recorded in human-dominated habitats. Previous studies of the diet
   of E. spelaea relied on morphological identification of pollen grains
   found in faeces and on the body of bats and by necessity disregarded
   other forms of digested plant material present in the faeces (i.e.,
   plant juice and remnants). The main objective of this study was to
   examine the diet of the nectarivorous bat, E. spelaea, roosting in an
   urban cave at Batu Caves, Peninsular Malaysia by identifying the plant
   material present in the faeces of bats using DNA metabarcoding.
   Methods : Faeces were collected under the roost of E. spelaea week from
   December 2015 to March 2016, Plant DNA was extracted from the Polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) amplified at ITS2 and rbcL, regions and mass
   sequenced. The resultant plant operational taxonomic units were searched
   against NCBI GenBank for identification.
   Results: A total of 55 species of plants were detected from faeces of E.
   spelaea including Artocarpus heterophyllus, Duabanga grandiflora and
   Musa spp. which are likely to be important food resources for the cave
   nectar bat.
   Discussion: Many native plant species that had not been reported in
   previous dietary studies of E. spelaea were detected in this study
   including Bauhinia strychnoidea and Urophyllum leucophlaeum, suggesting
   that E. spelaea remains a crucial pollinator for these Plants even in
   highly disturbed habitats. The detection of many introduced plant
   species in the bat faeces indicates that E. spelaea are exploiting them,
   particularly Xanthosternon chrysanthus, as food resources in urban area.
   Commercial food crops were detected from all of the faecal samples,
   suggesting that E. spelaea feed predominantly on the crops particularly
   jackfruit and banana and play a significant role in pollination of
   economically important plants. Ferns and figs were also dedected in th
   faeces of E. spelaea suggesting future research avenues to determine
   whether the `specialised nectarivorous' E. spelaea feed
   opportunistically on other parts of plants.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with aerobiological analyses realised during last 25
   years in the atmosphere of Malaga, a coastal city located in the
   southwest of the Mediterranean Basin. Air sampling was performed by
   means of 7-day recording volumetric pollen and spore traps, and pollen
   grains were counted with the aid of a light microscope, according to the
   methodology proposed by the Spanish Aerobiology Network. Pollen data
   were expressed as number of pollen grains per cubic metre of air. A peak
   in Quercus pollen production approximately every four years was
   detected, coinciding with drought periods. Although the natural
   vegetation of the studied area has been altered by urban growth and
   reforestation with pines, it is still represented by a disperse natural
   population of cork oak, holm oak and kermes oak (predominantly located
   to the northwest and northeast of the city). In this period the seasonal
   behaviour of anemophilous pollination of Quercus was studied, along with
   the relation between its intensity (pollen production) or temporality
   (phenophase of flowering) and meteorological or climatic variables. Also
   a study of trends in production and phenology of flowering was carried
   out. The annual intensity of anemophilous pollination of Quercus was
   significantly associated with the meteorological conditions of each
   spring, with the same parameters involved and in the same way as were
   seen on the daily and weekly scale (positive correlation with
   temperature and insolation, and negative with precipitation and relative
   humidity). The tendency for temperature and atmospheric aridity to
   increase is probably the cause of the trend observed in the spring
   Quercus pollen production to increase in the western Mediterranean. The
   temporality of Quercus anemophilous pollination (start date, peak date,
   end date and duration) changes each year and is positively associated
   with accumulated temperature and sun hours from 1st January until the
   dates in question. An accumulation of approximately 796 degrees C above
   the 9 degrees C threshold temperature from 1st January is necessary to
   trigger the start of the flowering period. We conclude that the effect
   of climatic change is mainly reflected in the pollination intensity of
   woody anemophilous species, which, in turn, have adapted their flowering
   time (phenology) to climate change. It is important to remember that
   climate change is leading to more arid conditions and that Mediterranean
   plants are adapted to this macrobioclimate (Mediterranean), which is
   characterized by a long dry period and high temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Systemic neonicotinoid insecticides used in urban arboriculture could
   pose a risk to bees and other pollinators foraging on treated plants. We
   measured uptake and dissipation of soil-applied imidacloprid and
   dinotefuran in nectar and leaves of 2 woody plant species, a broadleaf
   evergreen tree (Ilexxattenuata) and a deciduous shrub (Clethra
   alnifolia), to assess concentrations to which pollinators and pests
   might be exposed in landscape settings. Three application timings,
   autumn (postbloom), spring (prebloom), and summer (early postbloom),
   were evaluated to see if taking advantage of differences in the
   neonicotinoids' systemic mobility and persistence might enable pest
   control while minimizing transference into nectar. Nectar and tissue
   samples were collected from in-ground plants and analyzed for residues
   by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
   (HPLC-MS/MS) in 2 successive years. Concentrations found in nectar
   following autumn or spring applications ranged from 166 to 515ng/g for
   imidacloprid and from 70 to 1235ng/gg for dinotefuran, depending on
   plant and timing. These residues exceed concentrations shown to
   adversely affect individual- and colony-level traits of bees. Summer
   application mitigated concentrations of imidacloprid (8-31ng/g), but not
   dinotefuran (235-1191ng/g), in nectar. Our data suggest that dinotefuran
   may be more persistent than is generally believed. Implications for

Title = {{Effects of fragmentation on the plant functional composition and

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Questions: How do plant functional trait abundance and diversity in
   urban remnants of a rapidly urbanizing city change with fragmentation?
   Is there a delayed functional response to fragmentation?
   Location: Thirty remnant Banksia woodlands, Perth, Australia.
   Methods: We used GLMM to examine the effects of remnant age and area,
   and their interaction, on the relative abundance and functional
   diversity (FD) of five plant functional traits: growth form,
   pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient acquisition and regeneration
   strategies. We then used fourth-corner analysis to examine the influence
   of a wider set of fragmentation-related factors on trait abundances.
   Results: The functional composition and diversity of Banksia woodlands
   changed with remnant age, particularly in the smaller remnants. Plants
   more prone to decline with remnant age were the growth form shrubs,
   root-clustered trees, herbaceous obligate seeders and understorey
   species that are insect-pollinated, have seeds dispersal internally by
   animals and have arbuscular or ericoid mycorrhizas. In contrast, plants
   more prone to persist were growth forms trees, sedges and rushes,
   ectomycorrhizal trees, herbaceous resprouters, wind-pollinated and
   root-clustered understorey species. FD increased with remnant age in the
   growth forms and overstorey, but declined among the herbaceous and shrub
   pollination and nutrient acquisition traits.
   Conclusions: Functional traits that consistently signalled the plant
   community response to fragmentation were growth form, pollination and
   dispersal. This functional response was largely delayed, suggesting a
   functional extinction debt, which will lead to a further decline of
   plants with vulnerable trait states in the future, especially in the
   small- and medium-sized remnants. Our study illustrates the
   vulnerability of small remnants to changes in community assembly and
   ecosystem function due to fragmentation. Furthermore, it exemplifies how
   a functional trait approach is valuable to understand the impacts of
   urbanization on remnant plant communities, before local extinctions may
   occur. Finally, the study shows how cities' fragmentation history and
   biogeographic settings provide an important context influencing plant
   functional responses to urbanization-related processes.}},

   clementina Hort. ex Tan.). We examine flower bud development, invitro
   pollen germination and pollen-pistil interaction at different
   temperatures (15, 20, 25 or 30 degrees C). These temperatures span the
   range from cold' to hot' weather during the flowering season in many
   citrus-growing regions. Temperature had a strong effect on flower and
   ovary development, pollen germination, and pollen tube growth kinetics.
   In particular, parthenocarpic fruit development (indicated by juice
   vesicle growth) was initiated early if flowers were exposed to warmer
   temperatures during anthesis. Exposure to different temperatures during
   flower bud development also alters expression of the
   self-incompatibility reaction. This affects the point in the pistil at
   which pollen tube growth is arrested and confirms the role of sub- and
   supra-optimal temperatures in determining the numbers of pollen tubes
   reaching the ovary.}},

Abstract = {{The species of the family Juglandaceae have evolved along 56 million
   years, being distributed all over the world. Juglans neotropica is
   native to South America; it is found from 1800 m to 2800 m in altitude,
   in dry and humid low montane forests. It is a species of alternate
   composite leaves, monoecious, with cross-pollination and anemophilous,
   dispersed by animals and water, with annual reproduction. Currently, it
   is cataloged in danger of extinction (EN A2cd) since 52\% of its
   populations are over exploited for purposes of producing timber. The
   uses of the species make it promising; its wood is one of the most
   valuable in the world because of the fact that active substances with
   potential for the textile industry, medicine and human food have been
   found in all of its parts; it has been used as an excellent source of
   firewood in rural areas. This species is key in the adaptation to the
   climate change because of its environmental services in the ecological
   recovery of degraded soils, and for maintaining the quality of air and
   water under agroforestry systems that, at the same time, are a habitat
   and source of food resources for wildlife. Also it is important as
   ornamental in urbanized Andean landscapes. Because of all those
   arguments, a propagation proposal is made as a conservation measure in
   Andean zones, based on documented studies for the species.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Pollinator populations in North America are in decline, including the
   iconic monarch butterfly. In order to determine if public knowledge of
   monarchs informs opinions on butterfly conservation, we surveyed the
   public to assess their knowledge of monarchs. We also asked participants
   about their attitudes towards general butterfly conservation and if they
   believe that butterfly gardens contribute to conservation. Respondents
   generally had some knowledge of monarchs but were unaware of monarch
   population declines and the necessity of milkweed to their life cycle.
   Respondent knowledge was correlated with more positive attitudes about
   butterfly conservation. Furthermore, membership in an environmental
   organization increased the likelihood that the participant had prior
   knowledge of monarchs and cared about monarch conservation. Respondent
   socioeconomic factors of age and sex were also significantly correlated
   with conservation attitudes-older and female participants had more
   positive attitudes towards general butterfly conservation.
   Interestingly, females were also less likely than males to admit having
   prior knowledge of monarchs, indicating that gender may also play an
   important role in conservation outreach efforts. Our study indicates
   that educational efforts need to be directed more toward individuals not
   already associated with an environmental organization as these
   individuals are predisposed to regard conservation positively.}},

Abstract = {{Inselberg formations rise from the eastern Brazilian landscape like
   islands interspersed within a matrix of tropical vegetation. As this
   environment is highly threatened by recent urban expansion and the
   indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources, the orchid species
   endemic to these inselbergs have suffered drastic reductions in the
   sizes of their populations. To verify whether this process has been
   accompanied by the loss of total genetic variability and stochastic
   changes of the genetic structure of the remaining populations, the
   genetic variability and structure of all known relict Cattleya lobata
   populations were assessed using dominant molecular markers (ISSRs), and
   their genetic conservation status was defined. High genetic variability
   was detected (H-e = 0.262; I = 0.463), with most of the variation
   occurring within the populations (93\%), along with a weak but
   significant genetic structure (Phi(ST) = 0.074; P < 0.001). Pollination
   by deception and long-distance seed dispersal may explain the higher
   variability values than those expected for impacted species with small
   populations. Historical factors, such as a more continuous distribution
   in the recent past with interconnected populations and perennial habit
   with long-lived individuals, can contribute to the maintenance of
   ancestral genotypes and a highly variable and homogeneous gene pool.
   These factors can reduce the possible effects of genetic drift, even in
   the most heavily impacted C. lobata populations in the tourist areas of
   Rio de Janeiro.}},

Title = {{Hummingbirds use taste and touch to discriminate against nectar
   resources that contain Argentine ants}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Hummingbirds compete with other floral visitors for access to floral
   resources (nectar). Several hummingbird species, including Anna's
   (Calypte anna), Black-chinned (Archilochus alexandri), Allen's
   (Selasphorus sasin), and Costa's (Calypte costae) hummingbirds, make
   extensive use of non-native plants of urban areas of Southern
   California. Exploitation of urban ornamentals may expose hummingbirds to
   increased interactions with invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema
   humile), which are also frequently found foraging on flowers in such
   habitats. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which hummingbirds
   interact with invasive ants at nectar resources in a series of aviary
   and wild experiments. When given a choice, hummingbirds avoided flowers
   and feeders with ants in or feeding at a sucrose solution. We identified
   specific ant-derived cues (visual, tactile, and gustatory) which are
   sufficient to elicit changes in bird foraging. Tactile and gustatory
   cues appeared to play the strongest role in mediating interactions with
   Argentine ants, with visual cues alone not enough to deter hummingbirds
   from feeding at sugar resources with ants. Our experiments provide
   support for interference competition at floral resources, where ants
   limit the birds' access to flowers and feeders.
   Significance statement
   Hummingbirds and invasive Argentine ants both visit and exploit floral
   resources. However, hummingbirds avoid nectar sources that are occupied
   by ants. Here, we detail a series of mechanistic experiments to
   determine the proximate cause of this avoidance behavior. We found that
   the touch and taste of ants is strongly aversive to both wild,
   free-foraging and aviary hummingbirds. In urban environments and under
   low water situations, Argentine ants and hummingbirds come into frequent
   competition for the same few flowers. This competition leads to changes
   in foraging behavior and may have negative effects on hummingbirds.}},

Abstract = {{Gametophytic self-incompatibility, one of the key characters for
   seedless citrus production, is controlled by single codominant gene S
   known in pummelo, mandarin and their hybrid cultivars. However, little
   is known about S genotypes and S allele frequencies in Citrus cultivars.
   First, S genotypes and S allele frequencies of Citrus accessions were
   studied with S (4) and S (5) gene alleles of `Hassaku' (C. hassaku hort.
   ex Tanaka) a putative hybrid between self-incompatible pummelo {[}C.
   maxima (Burm.) Merrill; syn. C. grandis Osbeck] and `Kunenbo' (C.
   nobilis Lour. var. kunep Tanaka). About 200 Citrus accessions were
   pollinated with each of the homozygous S-1 seedlings (S (4) S (4) and S
   (5) S (5) ) of `Hassaku'. Pollen tube arrest in the styles indicated
   that 19 of 202 (9.4\%) accessions have an S (4) allele and 12 of 191
   (6.3\%) accessions have an S (5) allele. In pummelo, the rate of
   accessions with S (4) allele was 1.4\% (1/72), while that with S (5)
   allele was 5.9\% (9/76). This suggests that the two alleles are
   originated from pummelo and the allele frequency is 0.7\% (1/144) for S
   (4) and 5.9\% (9/152) for S (5) . Except `Kunenbo', all accessions with
   S (4) alleles have their origin in Japan. These results suggest that
   self-incompatible `Kunenbo' (S (4) S (?) ) introduced from Southeast
   Asia to Japan about 600 years ago firstly generated satsuma mandarin (S
   (f) S (4) ) and `Kabuchii' (S (4) S (?) ) about 400-500 years ago,
   followed by 16 S (4) -carrying cultivars including `Hassaku' (S (4) S
   (5) ) appearing as a chance seedling in Hiroshima in the nineteenth
   century.}},

Abstract = {{Parthenocarpy is one of the most essential factors for production of
   seedless citrus fruits that is a desirable trait for consumers and
   producers. However, little research has been done on the degree and type
   of parthenocarpy in citrus, except a few Citrus cultivars. To increase
   the knowledge about parthenocarpy for cultivation and breeding of
   seedless citrus, 113 Citrus accessions including pummelo, mandarin and
   their relatives were investigated. In self-incompatible accessions
   flower buds just before anthesis were bagged, while in self-compatible
   accessions they were non-pollinated to examine autonomous parthenocarpy
   or style-removed three days after pollination to examine stimulative
   parthenocarpy. Fruit set rate in each treatment in the 113 accessions
   was recorded one month after anthesis and the mature fruits were
   harvested to examine their size and seedlessness. There was no clear
   difference between stimulative and autonomous parthenocarpy in Citrus
   accessions examined, indicating that fruit set and development in the
   accessions is due to autonomous parthenocarpy. The parthenocarpic fruit
   set occurred in 22 of 50 accessions for pummelo, 26 of 32 accessions for
   pummelo relatives, 3 of 9 accessions for yuzu and relatives, 12 of 21
   accessions for mandarin and relatives, and 63 of 113 accessions in
   total. Of the 63 accessions, matured seedless fruits were harvested form
   19 accessions, of which five accessions `Shishiyuzu', `Kunenbo',
   `Okitsu-wase' and `Aoshima' satsuma mandarins and `Kiyonif tangos-showed
   very high degree of autonomous parthenocarpy, followed by `Kunenbo'
   hybrid accessions such as `Iyokan', `Hassalcu', `Kabosu' that showed
   high to moderate degree of autonomous parthenocarpy. Since `Kishu'
   mandarin (a seed parent of satsuma) and yuzu (a seed parent of `Kaboste)
   showed very little or no parthenocarpic fruit growth, it was suggested
   that `Kunenbo' carried parthenocarpic genes to satsuma mandarin and the
   other `Kunenbo' relatives showing medium to high autonomous
   parthenocarpy. It is suggested that these and the other accessions
   determined to have high to moderate degree of parthenocarpy are useful
   for production of seedless fruits and breeding of seedless Citrus
   cultivars.}},

Title = {{Can linear transportation infrastructure verges constitute a habitat
   and/or a corridor for insects in temperate landscapes? A systematic
   review}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE}},

Abstract = {{Background: The role of linear transportation infrastructures (roads,
   railways, oil and gas pipelines, power lines, rivers and canals) in
   fragmenting natural habitats is fully acknowledged. Up to now, the
   potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges (road and
   railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried
   pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity,
   remains controversial. In a context of decreasing natural habitats, the
   opportunities of anthropogenic areas for contributing to wildlife
   conservation have to be considered. The present paper is the first
   synthesis of evidence about the potential of linear transportation
   infrastructure verges as corridor and/or habitat for insects in
   temperate landscapes.
   Methods: A systematic literature survey was made using two online
   publication databases, a search engine and by sending a call for
   literature to subject experts. Identified articles were successively
   screened for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using
   criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific
   questions to categorize and to critically appraise the retained studies.
   These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and
   corridors for insects, and the effects of management and landscape
   context on these potentialities. A user-friendly database was created to
   sort the studies with low and medium susceptibility to bias. We used
   these studies to synthesize results of each specific question in a
   narrative synthesis. Finally, studies that met the meta-analysis
   requirements were used for a quantitative synthesis.
   Results: Our searches identified 64,206 articles. After critical
   appraisal, 91 articles that reported 104 studies were included in our
   review. Almost all of them had ``control-impact{''} design, only two
   studies used ``before-after-controlimpact{''} design, and one study used
   ``before-after{''} design. In some cases, artificialization of
   transportation infrastructures lowered insect biodiversity while
   vegetation restoration had a moderate positive effect; the trend
   remained unclear for mowing/grazing practices. Urbanization and
   agriculture in the surroundings tended to lower the biodiversity hosted
   by verges, while natural and forested areas tended to promote it. No
   study dealt with the influence of management or surrounding landscape on
   insect dispersal along the verge. The small number of studies that
   compared the dispersal along verges and in habitats away from
   transportation infrastructures, together with the inconsistencies of
   their results, prevented us from drawing conclusions. Meta-analyses were
   performed on 709 cases from 34 primary studies that compared
   biodiversity in verges vs. other habitats. Overall insect species
   richness did not differ between LTI verges and compared habitats.
   Globally, insect abundance seemed higher on LTI verges than in compared
   habitats, a result driven by the higher abundance of pollinators and
   primary consumers on non-highway road verges than in habitats away from
   roads.
   Conclusions: A major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear
   transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for insects has been
   identified. Thus, we encourage more research on this topic.
   Infrastructure practitioners could benefit from our results about linear
   transportation infrastructure verges as habitat for certain taxa and
   about the impact of their management practices on insect abundance and
   species richness.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen grains are regularly used as markers to determine an insect's
   movement patterns or host (plant) feeding behavior, yet conventional
   morphology-based pollen grain analysis (or palynology) encounters a
   number of important limitations. In the present study, we combine
   conventional analytical approaches with DNA meta-barcoding to identify
   pollen grains attached to migrating adults of the turnip moth, Agrotis
   segetum (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Northeast China. More specifically,
   pollen grains were dislodged from 2566 A. segetum long-distance migrants
   captured on Beihuang Island (Bohai Sea) and identified to many (plant)
   species level. Pollen belonged to 26 families of plants, including
   Fagaceae, Oleaceae, Leguminosae, Asteraceae, Pinaceae and Rosaceae,
   including common species such as Citrus sinensis, Olea europaea,
   Ligustrum lucidum, Robinia pseudoacacia, Castanopsis echinocarpa, Melia
   azedarach and Castanea henryi. As the above plants are indigenous to
   southern climes, we deduce that A. segetum forage on plants in those
   locales prior to engaging in northward spring migration. Our work
   validates the use of DNA-assisted approaches in lepidopteran pollination
   ecology research and provides unique and valuable information on the
   adult feeding range and geographical origin of A. segetum. Our findings
   also enable targeted (area-wide) pest management interventions or guide
   the future isolation of volatile attractants.}},

Abstract = {{Different aspects of human activities can cause environmental change
   that endanger species persistence, alter species distributions, and lead
   to changes in antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, whereas
   deforestation and flooding of riparian forest results in landscapes
   consisting of patchily distributed riparian forest fragments in a matrix
   of pastures, plantations, and urban areas. Therefore, we assessed the
   richness, abundance, and trophic interactions of trap-nesting
   Hymenoptera and their parasites at four patches of restored riparian
   forest and at one reference natural fragment, of different sizes and
   ages, located at the Volta Grande Reservoir, in Minas Gerais and So
   Paulo states to answer the following questions: (1) Does the richness
   and abundance of cavity-nesting bees and wasps differ in riparian forest
   fragments according to the seasonal periods? (2) Does the composition of
   cavity-nesting bees and wasps vary among restoration and reference sites
   and between climate seasons (wet and dry)? (3) How do the degrees of
   specialization of the parasites vary among the patches of forest? We
   recorded 12 species of wasps, eight of bees, and nine species of
   parasites. Areas with longer time since restoration (reference site)
   showed higher species richness. However, the abundance was higher in
   most recent areas. The composition of bee and wasp assembly has not
   significantly changed between the climate seasons, although it is
   different between sampling areas. The richness and abundance were higher
   in warmer and rainy periods. The rate of bee and wasp mortality was
   high. The degree of specialization of parasites varies among sampling
   units, and the network of host-parasite interaction has a modular
   configuration with generalists and specialists. We concluded that the
   restored areas with more complex habitat could provide better conditions
   for the reestablishment of ecological interactions among these insects,
   the local flora, and other invertebrates, which together contribute to
   the success of the restored environments.}},

Abstract = {{The world is becoming increasingly urbanized, with more than half of the
   global population now living in cities. Understanding the factors
   impacting natural communities in fragmented landscapes is therefore
   crucial for predicting how the remaining ecosystems will respond to
   global change. Ground-active arthropods, which are important in nutrient
   cycling, are likely sensitive to habitat changes resulting from
   urbanization.
   We addressed two questions: (1) What is the relative importance of local
   and landscape factors in shaping ground-active arthropod communities in
   urban woodlands? (2) How does body size (as a surrogate for dispersal
   ability) affect sensitivity to landscape-level factors?
   In the summers of 2010 and 2011, we sampled ground-active arthropod
   communities in 19 woodlands in the Chicago metropolitan region using
   pitfall traps. We also assessed local plant and soil characteristics, as
   well as landscape-level variables using GIS.
   Redundancy analyses and variation partitioning revealed that local
   factors, particularly invasive woody-plant cover and soil nitrate, had
   the most influence on arthropod communities, explaining 12\% of the
   total variation. Of the landscape-level variables, landscape richness,
   which is one measure of landscape fragmentation, explained the most
   variation; however, the shared variance between landscape and local
   variables was responsible for half (16\%) of the total explained
   variation (32\%). Landscape factors alone explained only 4\% of
   variation. No relationship between arthropod body size and landscape
   variables was observed, but several groups (e.g. ants and ground
   beetles) were correlated with landscape-level factors.
   Our research shows that both local and landscape variables are important
   in influencing ground-active arthropods, but the majority of explained
   variance is attributed to the covariation between landscape richness,
   invasive woody-plant cover, and soil nitrate. We therefore conclude that
   landscape fragmentation is likely affecting the ground-active arthropods
   through its positive influence on invasive woody plants and soil
   nitrogen.}},

Abstract = {{Urban vegetation is an essential requirement in cities for mitigating
   pollution, heat island effects and providing food and shelter to urban
   fauna. Efforts to conserve and augment green cover in cities, however,
   often lack data on the genetic diversity of urban trees, which could be
   crucial to the success of such programmes. We investigate the population
   genetics of the cluster fig Ficus racemosa, which occurs naturally in
   Indian cities and is a keystone species for urban fauna. Genetic
   analysis of 51 F. racemosa trees in urban Bangalore, India, shows no
   evidence of inbreeding; the overall inbreeding coefficient (F (is) )
   across 12 microsatellite markers (0.0366) was non-significant with no
   evidence of heterozygote deficit. Spatial genetic structure (SGS)
   analysis of 47 trees showed an overall negative relationship between
   kinship coefficient and spatial distance, with strong SGS at distances <
   1 km. The absence of heterozygote deficit is likely due to the fig's
   obligate mutualistic association with fig wasps which pollinate their
   flowers even across long distances. However, the strong SGS at short
   distances could result from clumped seed dispersal close to natal trees.
   Therefore, the pattern of population genetics for F. racemosa from urban
   Bangalore likely results from short-distance seed dispersal and
   long-distance pollen flow. Despite the scattered and fragmented nature
   of green areas within cities, these gene mobility factors maintain
   robust population genetics in F. racemosa even at low population
   densities. The same may not apply for Ficus species that are planted as
   vegetative cuttings in cities and therefore may have limited genetic
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{In 2008, a new species for the French bee fauna was recorded in Allauch
   near Marseille: the giant resin bee, Megachile sculpturalis (Smith,
   1853). This was the first European record of this species that is native
   to East Asia. To our knowledge, it is the first introduced bee species
   in Europe. Here, we provide an overview of the current distribution of
   M.sculpturalis in France and we describe the history of its range
   expansion. Besides our own observations, information was compiled from
   literature and Internet websites, and by contacting naturalist networks.
   We collected a total of 117 records (localityxyear combinations) for the
   2008-2016 period. The geographical range of M.sculpturalis has extended
   remarkably, now occupying a third of continental France, with the most
   northern and western records located 335 and 520km from Allauch,
   respectively. Information on its phenology, feeding, and nesting
   behavior is also provided. We report several events of nest occupation
   or eviction of Osmia sp. and Xylocopa sp. individuals by M.sculpturalis.
   Our results show that M.sculpturalis is now well established in France.
   Given its capacity to adapt and rapidly expand its range, we recommend
   amplifying the monitoring of this species to better anticipate the
   changes in its geographical range and its potential impacts on native
   bees.}},

Abstract = {{1 Global population declines of insect pollinators highlight the need
   for a greater ecological understanding of the responses of wild
   pollinators to local management actions and to human alterations of
   landscapes, especially in the tropics where crops are highly dependent
   on wild pollinators.
   2 We examined the effects of local and landscape factors on the richness
   and abundance of bees in farms around Bangkok, Thailand. Bee communities
   in 24 mango (Mangifera indica L.) orchards in heavily modified
   landscapes (61-99\% anthropogenic land cover) were compared. We
   predicted that bees would be more species rich in orchards with higher
   flower diversity, whereas small-sized bees with non-eusocial and/or
   below-ground nesting habits would be more sensitive to human
   disturbance, and hence rare.
   3 Twenty-eight species were caught and individuals of genus Apis
   comprised >92\% of 3842 bees sampled and dominated all 24 sites.
   4 Habitat effects on bee richness and abundance were stronger at the
   farm scale than at the landscape scale. At the farm scale, total bee
   richness and abundance, as well as small, non-eusocial and below-ground
   nesting bee richness and abundance, were negatively associated with
   field size and positively associated with flowering plant diversity. The
   percentage of urban land cover within a 1-km radius was weakly but
   positively related to total bee richness and small-sized bee richness;
   total bee abundance was positively associated with wetland cover.
   5 A greater diversity of flowering plants retained in smaller fields
   maintained higher bee richness and abundances, particularly small-sized
   bees. Farmers can enhance bee populations by maintaining small patches
   of flowers in their fields.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting how species' abundances and ranges will shift in response to
   climate change requires a mechanistic understanding of how multiple
   factors interact to limit population growth. Both abiotic stress and
   species interactions can limit populations and potentially set range
   boundaries, but we have a poor understanding of when and where each is
   most critical. A commonly cited hypothesis, first proposed by Darwin,
   posits that abiotic factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation) are
   stronger determinants of range boundaries in apparently abiotically
   stressful areas ({''}stress{''} indicates abiotic factors that reduce
   population growth), including desert, polar, or high-elevation
   environments, whereas species interactions (e.g., herbivory,
   competition) play a stronger role in apparently less stressful
   environments. We tested a core tenet of this hypothesis-that population
   growth rate is more strongly affected by species interactions in less
   stressful areas-using experimental manipulations of species interactions
   affecting a common herbaceous plant, Hibiscus meyeri (Malvaceae), across
   an aridity gradient in a semiarid African savanna. Population growth was
   more strongly affected by four distinct species interactions
   (competition with herbaceous and shrubby neighbors, herbivory, and
   pollination) in less stressful mesic areas than in more stressful arid
   sites. However, contrary to common assumptions, this effect did not
   arise because of greater density or diversity of interacting species in
   less stressful areas, but rather because aridity reduced sensitivity of
   population growth to these interactions. Our work supports classic
   predictions about the relative strength of factors regulating population
   growth across stress gradients, but suggests that this pattern results
   from a previously unappreciated mechanism that may apply to many species
   worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Polyploid cultivars produced via cell engineering are a valuable
   germplasm resource for citrus improvement. Application of molecular
   markers can greatly enhance the efficiency of citrus breeding via cell
   engineering. In our program, allotetraploid somatic hybrids were
   produced from over 50 interspecific or intergeneric fusion combinations,
   and characterized by molecular markers. We also exploited plenty of
   double diploids facilitated by flow cytometry and simple sequence repeat
   (SSR) marker analysis. Some of the somatic hybrids and double diploids
   have served as pollen parents for interploidy sexual crossing, and
   thousands of triploid plants were recovered by embryo rescue, flow
   cytometry and SSR marker analysis. Based on molecular marker analysis of
   numerous citrus somatic hybrids and cybrids, a strategy of producing
   male-sterile cybrids was developed. It consists of a standard symmetric
   fusion of the protoplasts from embryogenic callus induced from `Satsuma'
   mandarin (cytoplasmic male-sterility type) with mesophyll protoplasts of
   elite seedy cultivars. Some of the regenerated diploid cybrids
   containing sterile cytoplasm from `Satsuma' have already displayed male
   sterility and seedlessness. Understanding the molecular mechanism of
   male sterility in a citrus somatic cybrid was conducted via omics
   approaches. Haploids and di-haploids were also regenerated via anther
   culture or pollination with gamma-irradiated pollen, and molecularly
   characterized.}},

   abiotic conditions (e.g., air pollution, water scarcity, soil
   contamination) that can represent sources of stress, compromising their
   growth and aesthetic qualities. Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs)
   have generally limited water and nutritional needs and high tolerance to
   contaminants, such as heavy metals. These low maintenance requirements,
   together with a high aesthetic value, make MAPs more and more used in
   urban green areas. Salvia spp. and Helichrysum spp. with abundant and
   long lasting blooms and grey foliage, are widely employed as ground
   cover, traffic divider, borders, road slopes and roundabouts and for
   vertical gardens. In terms of increasing biodiversity more generally,
   MAPs can also represent a sink of abundant nectar for pollinating
   insects even in the urban environment. In the present study, we analysed
   some of the most important MAPs used in urban green areas, highlighting
   their water needs.}},

Abstract = {{Global warming and climate change is the greatest concern of mankind in
   the 21st century. Climate change is projected to cause an increase in
   temperature, variations in rainfall, and an increase in frequency of
   extreme events such as heat, cold waves, frost days, droughts, floods,
   etc. Various plant processes like vegetative growth, flowering, fruiting
   and fruit quality are highly vulnerable to climate changes. Two major
   parameters of climate changes that have far reaching implications on
   plants are more erratic rainfall patterns and unpredictable high
   temperature spells which are consequently expected to reduce crop
   productivity. Drought reduced fruit set and increased fruit cracking in
   pomegranate and litchi. An increase in atmospheric temperature and
   change of rainfall pattern affected the banana cultivation in some
   countries. In various fruit crops, moisture stress and high temperature
   during flowering strongly influences the pollen and ovule quality and
   consequently the fruit set and yield. The promotion of stigma and stamen
   sterility in papaya is mainly because of the higher temperature, which
   caused flower drops as well as sex changes in female and hermaphrodite
   flowers. Flower drop is quite common in mango, guava, litchi and other
   fruits, if low temperature prevails during flowering. Studies have
   clearly shown that the population abundance, geographic range and
   pollination activities of important pollinator species like bees, moths,
   and butterflies are declining considerably with changing climate. Higher
   temperature during fruit growth and development increased the incidence
   of several physiological disorders like spongy tissue and black tip in
   mango, cracking of fruits, granulation in citrus, etc. Pest ecology of
   certain crops is changing due to climate change. Fruit fly in guava,
   carambola, citrus, etc. is becoming alarming due to hot and humid
   conditions. Warm and humid conditions are also favorable for pests like
   beetles, bugs and other sucking pests and diseases like mildew, blight,
   etc. Development of new varieties with higher yield potential and
   resistance to multiple stresses (drought, flood, salinity) should be the
   key to maintain yield. Improvement in germplasm of important tropical
   and subtropical fruit crops for heat stress tolerance should be one of
   the targets of breeding programs. Location specific soil and water
   conservation models, protocol for organic farming, conservation
   horticulture, development of biotic and abiotic stress tolerance
   rootstocks, etc., are some of the strategies to mitigate the impact of
   climate change. This paper briefly discussed the impact and mitigation
   strategies of climate change on tropical and subtropical fruits.}},

   watermelon developed and released in our laboratory, both with high
   levels of tolerance to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (Fon) race 1 and
   race 2. Both lines are currently at the S-9 filial generation, but
   exhibit 5-10\% segregation away from the tolerant phenotype, thus the
   lines are not 100\% ``fixed{''}. These two lines were crossed by hand
   pollination. Hybrids of these two lines appear to be fixed for this
   phenotype in only 5 generations (F s ), leading us to hypothesize that
   tolerance genes between the two lines may be different. These lines are
   currently being called `Bulldog'. The earlier generations of these
   hybrid lines have been tested in field trials with excellent results in
   terms of Fon race 2 tolerance. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, this line was
   tested for grafting ability, plant vigor and yielding ability in the
   field as a potential rootstock, with the scion material being
   `Fascination'. This line was tested against interspecific hybrid squash
   rootstock (`Carnivor'), and Lagenaria hybrid rootstock ('Macis').
   Grafting results demonstrated a very vigorous rootstock that resulted in
   a 90\% survival rate, equal to that of both `Carnivor' and `Macis'.
   Fruit yields exceeded rootstock `Carnivor' but were not significantly
   different in both fruit number and marketable fruit size. Rootstock
   `Bulldog' was significantly higher than both `Macis' and `Fascination'
   (non-grafted). However the fruit quality was not equal to the other two
   rootstocks. Fruits were not as firm and the holding ability of the fruit
   in the field was reduced.}},

Abstract = {{By playing a significant role in ecosystems, like consuments-phytophages
   and pollinators, daytime luskokryli (Diurna) is one of the most notable
   in nature of insect groups and has a scientific-cognitive and aesthetic
   value. In our work, we investigated the present state of biodiversity
   and the species composition of the daytime butterflies of the Kaniv
   district, in particular, the village of Buchak. The basis of our study
   was the refinement of taxonomic species, the establishment of relative
   numbers, as well as the period of the flight of adults and the number of
   generations per year, which in the future will enable the development of
   effective ecologically sound methods for controlling the number of
   species of pests and optimizing the number of rare beneficial species.
   Buchak is one of the few villages spread out in the middle of the
   forests on the hills of the Dnipro, on the right bank of the lower water
   area of the Kaniv reservoir, twenty kilometers from the city of Kanev,
   Cherkassy region of Ukraine. The distribution of the fauna of daytime
   butterflies and the peculiarities of their existence in different
   biotopes, among which are identified 5 main types: open lowland meadows,
   mixed forests, forest-steppe areas, right bank of the river Dnipro and
   lake Buchak, agrobiocenoses. The quality of representativeness of the
   species diversity of the fauna of the day luskokrylykh has been
   estimated by calculating their index of domination and the distribution
   index in the main biotopes of the studied territory. Twenty five species
   of daytime luskokrylykh from 6 families (Papilionidae, Pieridae,
   Nymphalidae, Lycaenidae, Syntomidae, Hesperiidae) were caught. The most
   rich in species composition of daytime butterflies of the studied area
   are forest-steppe areas, and the least numerous are areas on the right
   bank of the river Dnipro and lake Buchak.}},

Abstract = {{Though urban agriculture (UA), defined here as growing of crops in
   cities, is increasing in popularity and importance globally, little is
   known about the aggregate benefits of such natural capital in built-up
   areas. Here, we introduce a quantitative framework to assess global
   aggregate ecosystem services from existing vegetation in cities and an
   intensive UA adoption scenario based on data-driven estimates of urban
   morphology and vacant land. We analyzed global population, urban,
   meteorological, terrain, and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
   datasets in Google Earth Engine to derive global scale estimates,
   aggregated by country, of services provided by UA. We estimate the value
   of four ecosystem services provided by existing vegetation in urban
   areas to be on the order of \$33 billion annually. We project potential
   annual food production of 100-180 million tonnes, energy savings ranging
   from 14 to 15 billion kilowatt hours, nitrogen sequestration between
   100,000 and 170,000 tonnes, and avoided storm water runoff between 45
   and 57 billion cubic meters annually. In addition, we estimate that food
   production, nitrogen fixation, energy savings, pollination, climate
   regulation, soil formation and biological control of pests could be
   worth as much as \$80-160 billion annually in a scenario of intense UA
   implementation. Our results demonstrate significant country-to-country
   variability in UA-derived ecosystem services and reduction of food
   insecurity. These estimates represent the first effort to consistently
   quantify these incentives globally, and highlight the relative spatial
   importance of built environments to act as change agents that alleviate
   mounting concerns associated with global environmental change and
   unsustainable development.}},

Title = {{Pollinators as isolation mechanisms: field observations and field
   experiments regarding specificity of pollinator attraction in the genus
   Ophrys (Orchidaceae und Insecta, Hymenoptera, Apoidea)}},
Journal = {{ENTOMOLOGIA GENERALIS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{261-316}},
Abstract = {{It is demonstrated that the biological species concept of the genus
   Ophrys corresponds to the general concepts of Ernst Mayr. On the example
   of two closely related forms of the fusca group in Andalucia, it is
   shown how to handle the different criteria of the biospecies concept.
   One is the high specifity of attraction of a male bee followed by a
   complex pseudocopulation behaviour which enables the correct pollen
   transfer within the species. The high specifity is caused by a highly
   remarkable imitation of the sexual pheromones of the mimicked female of
   the pollinator. Sexual pheromones of animals act as intraspecific
   signals which result in attractions of only males of the same species.
   Exactly this specific behaviour is triggered by the Ophrys flower, too.
   Thus the pollinator male is attracted only to those flowers which have
   the correct mixture of the pheromone molecules. To further ensure
   success the pollinating males also select other characters of the Ophrys
   flower as labellum size, colour, labellum hair characters, phenology and
   possibly habitat selections etc. In the sexual reproduction behaviour of
   the male insect acts as pregamic isolation mechanisms for the given
   Ophrys like for their own female.
   We were successful in confirming the high specifity of the pollination
   mechanisms in numerous field experiments, mainly choice experiments,
   this in contrast o the statements of Hennecke \& Munzinger (2013). They
   had argued that there were many different pollinator species listed in
   the literature for a given Ophrys species. However, they did not
   critically assess the reliability of these citations. For this, they
   would have had to critically read the primary literature and not only
   the secondary quotations like in Delforge (2005, 2016) or others.
   Therefore, they rehashed many of the old mistakes concerning wrong
   identifications of the bees or even the Ophrys taxons which had long
   been corrected. Especially a mixture of old and actual names of the same
   species in different combinations is annoying and seems to demonstrate
   that the authors are not really fit in the nomenclature of Ophrys and
   their pollinators. This is demonstrated by some examples, which are very
   confusing without knowledge of the bees. For example, these authors did
   not realize that a 3-4 mm bee (Andrena hesperia) could not serve as a
   pollinator of a 20 mm labellum of a large Ophrys omegaifera species.
   However, there are some cases with more than one pollinator. Besides the
   main pollinator the others I call them ``secondary pollinators{''} which
   in those cases we could check their pollination contribution in the
   population is very weak. In many cases, these secondary visitors are
   mainly pollinaria thieves because they are only attracted and try to
   copulate. However, they seem learn very quickly that Ophrys is not a
   true female and will never visit another flower of this kind. In some
   quantitative field experiments (with Eucera nigrescens/longicornis on
   Ophrys holosericea) we could confirm this hypothesis.
   The conclusion of the two authors that Ophrys species are not
   species-specific regarding sexual attractivity does not correspond to
   our field experiments regarding olfactory compound investigations in
   biotests, and does not agree with the molecular data of population
   biology and with the genetic analyses.
   The other proof the authors used in their argumentations are the
   supposed frequency of hybrids. But this is also a spurious argument.
   Hybrids are only frequent in literature and not in nature. In places
   frequently visited by orchid enthusiasts, the number of observed
   ``hybrids{''} is conspicuously high, which may indicate ``hand
   pollination{''}.
   The aim of the two authors has been to reduce the many species within
   Ophrys because they cannot be discriminated. Consequently, they try to
   establish a simplified classification system without any biological
   background. A complete anthropomorphic typological systematic like the
   ``Index of accepted plant names{''} is issued by Kew Gardens. However,
   this is in the 21st century, 150 years after Darwin, a kind of middle
   age taxonomy. They use a quite typological morphospecies concept like in
   the book of Pederson \& Faurhold (2007). This does not fit with nature.
   If you pay attention to the different criteria of the biospecies concept
   within the genus Ophrys you will recognise the many species which the
   genus makes so interesting.
   A critical list of the known specific pollinators of the genus Ophrys is
   given as an appendix.}},

   positive correlation between the size of seeds found in faecal samples
   with their availability in the habitat. Only one seed was found visually
   damaged after passage through the squirrel monkeys' guts. The defecated
   seeds were uniformly distributed (variance to mean ratio index) in the
   home range of squirrel monkeys, and there was a lack of specific
   latrines (i. e., habitat preference for defecation). Our data provide
   evidence that non-native S. sciureus may in be (i) acting as a potential
   seed disperser of native plants in the Atlantic forest fragment, (ii)
   contributing to the ecological role of native frugivores, and (iii)
   potentially contributing to the regeneration process of the highly
   degraded study site. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic landscapes are associated with biodiversity loss and large
   shifts in species composition and traits. These changes predict the
   identities of winners and losers of future global change, and also
   reveal which environmental variables drive a taxon's response to land
   use change. We explored how the biodiversity of native bee species
   changes across forested, agricultural, and urban landscapes. We
   collected bee community data from 36 sites across a 75,000 km(2) region,
   and analyzed bee abundance, species richness, composition, and
   life-history traits. Season-long bee abundance and richness were not
   detectably different between natural and anthropogenic landscapes, but
   community phenologies differed strongly, with an early spring peak
   followed by decline in forests, and a more extended summer season in
   agricultural and urban habitats. Bee community composition differed
   significantly between all three land use types, as did phylogenetic
   composition. Anthropogenic land use had negative effects on the
   persistence of several life-history strategies, including early spring
   flight season and brood parasitism, which may indicate adaptation to
   conditions in forest habitat. Overall, anthropogenic communities are not
   diminished subsets of contemporary natural communities. Rather, forest
   species do not persist in anthropogenic habitats, but are replaced by
   different native species and phylogenetic lineages preadapted to open
   habitats. Characterizing compositional and functional differences is
   crucial for understanding land use as a global change driver across
   large regional scales.}},

   and C. mirabile emitted fruity compounds. We produced interspecific
   hybrids between two C. persicum cultivars and C. purpurascens (which
   emitted the greatest number of volatile compounds) and analysed the
   scent characteristics of the resulting hybrids. We found that the

Abstract = {{The City of Winona is a small urban center (27,500 people) in
   southeastern Minnesota. Located along the Mississippi River, the city is
   nestled below steep bluffs that limit further urban development.
   Winona's riverine location has been shaping its economy for the past 150
   years, enriching a culture and history that persists to the present day.
   In addition, the area's fragile karst geology has focused attention on
   the management and protection of soil and water resources since
   early-settlement days. Consequently, sustainable development has become
   a solid cultural construct within the community for several decades.
   Citizens have been striving to achieve a sustainable life style and
   economy through on-going conservation efforts, continuing to make Winona
   a distinctive tourist destination in the Upper Midwest region of the US.
   Our work focused on several sustainability objectives (or indicators) to
   be achieved, specifically urban agriculture, composting, parks and green
   areas conservation, urban landscaping to attract pollinators species,
   water quality, sustainable tourism, and recycling. The city participates
   in the County's recycling program, which is one of the state's top
   programs for citizens' participation and volume of recyclable materials
   per capita. This chapter will illustrate both the challenges and
   opportunities for pursuing sustainable development in Winona based on
   the seven indicators listed above.}},

Abstract = {{This work aimed to evaluate the floral and physicochemical
   characteristics of passion fruits BRS Perola do Cerrado cultivar
   (Passiflora setacea D.C.), as well as its relationship with local
   climatic factors. Peak flowering, time in days of floral appearance
   until anthesis and until fruits harvest, floral morphometry, time of
   flower opening and closing, occurrence of natural self-pollination,
   geitonogamy and floral incompatibility, physicochemical characteristics
   of fruits and relationship with climatic variables were evaluated. Under
   the conditions of this study, it was observed that the flowering peak
   occurred in November and the time of flower opening ranged from 7:21 pm
   to 8:40 pm throughout the year, probably influenced by daily solar
   radiation; while the time of flower closing occurred between 6:00 am and
   8:00 pm. After closing, flowers showed no recurrence of floral opening.
   Flowers of Passiflora setacea species BRS Perola do Cerrado cultivar are
   self-incompatible and do not allow geitonogamy. Therefore, for fruit
   formation, cross-pollination is necessary. Regarding fruit setting in
   the different pollination methods, rates were 34.6\% when artificially
   made and 53.5\% in case of natural pollination. Fruits had, on average,
   longitudinal diameter of 4.9 cm, cross-sectional diameter of 46 mm and
   fresh mass of 55 g, juice volume of 15.7 ml per fruit, 13.31 degrees

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE \& BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Fruit set represents the very first step of fruit development. This
   study investigated the effect of different fruit-setting methods
   {[}1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3-phenylurea (CPPU) treatment, artificial
   pollination, and honey bee pollination] on the concentrations of
   fructose, glucose, and sucrose, and the activities of sucrose
   metabolising enzymes of watermelon fruit under plastic film greenhouse
   conditions. No significant difference in fructose and glucose
   concentrations was observed among the three treatments at fully ripe
   stage of fruit {[}33 days after anthesis (33 DAA)]. However, artificial
   and honey bee pollination significantly increased sucrose concentration.
   Measurement of sucrose metabolising enzyme activities and correlation
   analysis demonstrated that the increased activity of SuSy-s (sucrose
   synthase, synthesis direction) is the key mechanism of increased sucrose
   concentration in the artificially pollinated and honey bee pollinated
   fruits. The concentrations of fructose, glucose, and sucrose were
   similar between artificially pollinated and honey bee-pollinated fruits
   at fully ripe stage (33 DAA). Therefore, we can conclude that artificial
   and bee pollination can improve the sweetness of watermelon fruit. In
   addition, the honey bee can provide a pollination service that is
   similar to that of artificial pollination for watermelon grown in a
   protected cultivation system.}},

Abstract = {{Although orchid bees (Apidae: Euglossini) are known as key pollinators
   in tropical ecosystems, knowledge of their floral sources is still
   scarce, especially for those species commonly found in urban
   environments. We aimed to identify the pollen, nectar and resin sources
   used by the widespread species Euglossa cordata in an urban area in
   south-eastern Brazil. The residual pollen from 81 brood cells of nine
   nests reactivated between October 2013 and December 2014 was acetolysed
   and analysed. A total of 50 pollen types belonging to 20 botanical
   families were identified in the samples. Pollen sources included species
   from seven families; five of them were plants with poricidal anthers
   (Bixaceae, Commelinaceae, Fabaceae, Melastomataceae and Solanaceae). The
   mass-flowering trees Handroanthus chrysotrichus and H. heptaphyllus
   (Bignoniaceae) are firstly reported as important pollen sources to an
   orchid bee species. Nectar was collected primarily from plants with
   long, tubular corolla as Acanthaceae, Apocynaceae, Bignoniaceae and
   Convolvulaceae. The vine species Dalechampia stipulacea (Euphorbiaceae)
   acted as a floral resin source. All pollen sources consisted of native
   plants whereas some exotic plant species were visited for nectar
   collection. Although nesting in an area encompassed by a high proportion
   of invasive plant species, Euglossa cordata females preferred to visit
   native plants to gather floral resources.}},

   usage may have unintended impacts on human health (e.g., associations
   with cancer or Parkinson's disease) and vital ecosystem services (e.g.,
   air \& water quality and pollinator health). Understanding and
   mitigating the risks in real-world scenarios requires detailed
   information on pesticide usage. California's Pesticide Use Report (PUR)
   database is unique in the wealth of information it records on the
   millions of commercial pesticide applications in California annually.
   PUR data enable regulators, researchers and other stakeholders to
   examine fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns in pesticide usage and
   their potential negative effects on the environment and human health.
   Their investigations have generated over 500 scholarly articles in the
   scientific and medical literature. This chapter outlines the critical
   importance of PUR data to understanding the potential risks that
   agricultural and urban pesticide usage in California pose to human
   health and the environment to a degree that is not possible to achieve
   elsewhere in the world.}},

Abstract = {{The development of human society in general depends and is conditioned
   by the presence of fresh water resources. Certainly, the main cause,
   which has led to the ascending curve of current needs and consumption,
   is determined by the demographic explosion and the rapid urbanization
   process. Therefore, industry and agriculture are among the biggest
   consumers of water. The real problem is not lack of resources but
   effective distribution and overall management it is.
   In the context of the aforementioned, at NARDI Fundulea was developed in
   2010 a program to improve drought resistance and obtain new genotypes
   through introgression of resistance genes from Helianthus argophyllus
   species in cultivated specie (Helianthus annuus L.) (Project MAKIS,
   Financed by the World Bank). Helianthus argopyllus is the most
   interesting species with very pubescent leaves, moderate transpiration
   and good photosynthetic activity. These characters provide superior
   water use efficiency compared to cultivated species. For these reasons,
   it has been used in our research to achieve the above-mentioned goal.
   In this project, at NARDI Fundulea has successfully used interspecific
   immature embryo culture to obtain drought-resistant genotypes and
   shortening the breeding process by getting two to three
   generations/year.
   Starting with the BC6 generation of self-pollination, the resulted
   fertile lines (B, maintainer lines) were cross polinated with an
   androsterility source in order to produce the sterile analogues of these
   lines (all being B, maintenance, fertile) were performed. After 4-5
   generations of sterile plant selection, sterile analogue lines for each
   of the new creations were obtained. After this, new sunflower hybrids
   were obtained using certain fertility restoration lines from the NARDI
   Fundulea collection. The new hybrids were tested in three very different
   locations and years in terms of rainfall and temperatures during
   sunflower vegetation (2014-2015-2016).
   Based on the results we can conclude that interspecific hybridization
   may be an additional technique in the breeding of the sunflower and can
   be successfully used to create new sources of genetic variability to
   improve germplasm for drought and pathogens resistance.
   The newly created genotypes have responded positively to testing under
   different climatic and soil conditions and can be included in the
   approval list for both classical and ecological culture conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A group of Texas Woman's University (TWU) faculty have worked together
   to plan and implement a pollinator garden project as an academic
   teaching tool on our campus. This garden is not maintained by our campus
   landscape staff, but rather by faculty and student volunteers. It is a
   true citizen science project allowing our students to learn about plants
   native to our area in Texas, which are also drought tolerant, and their
   plant-pollinator relationships. There are many reasons for increasing
   concerns about failing support for biodiversity in our ecosystems. Our
   project involves the transformation of certain areas on campus from
   lawns, which require significant water, fertilizer and maintenance, into
   a set of sustainable pollinator gardens that will create habitat for
   insects and birds which underlie the biodiversity in all ecosystems.
   These will also be places of beauty for humans to refresh themselves.
   The plants in these gardens will require very little added maintenance,
   thus reducing pollution from pesticides and fertilizers. Because they
   are also drought tolerant, water consumption will be significantly lower
   once the beds are established. This discussion will detail the process,
   along with practical tips for others who may want to implement gardens
   on their campuses.}},

Abstract = {{The forests of Costa Rica are rich in a wide variety of pollinator types
   and a very diverse flora that supports them. Our research group from the
   University of California, Berkeley and Texas A \& M University, College
   Station has been researching the ecology of one pollinator group, the
   bees, in the northwest Guanacaste dry forest region since 1969. Much
   natural forest existed in this area when we first began the work. But,
   many land use changes have occurred over the years to present day to the
   point that it is difficult to find tracts of undisturbed forest suitable
   for field research, especially those not affected by wildfires, which
   are now common.
   Further, urban areas in the region continue to grow with increasing
   numbers of people populating the region. In this paper we provide an
   overview of our past bee-flower work for a historical perspective, and
   then weave in people that have now become an obvious ecological
   component of current bee-flower relationships. We also explore new
   questions that have become relevant through time, especially those
   related to researchers and potential conservation opportunities to share
   their stories with audiences that may extend their knowledge for
   practical use. Finally, we propose that researchers plan to devote some
   of their precious time establishing relationships with people in
   conserving what is left of bee-flower relationships in urban
   environments in Guanacaste and beyond in the country. Avenues for
   extending this knowledge are explored in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{The newly-constructed Nature Gardens at the Natural History Museum of
   Los Angeles County (California, USA) were purposefully built to attract
   wildlife. In this study we wanted to find out to what extent this
   manufactured environment is successful in attracting native insect fauna
   to the urban core of the city when compared to the surrounding
   neighborhoods or natural areas on the periphery of Los Angeles. To
   determine this, a one-year Malaise trap catch from the Nature Gardens
   was compared with samples from four neighboring sites within a
   five-kilometer radius, as well as a site adjacent to natural habitat
   located sixteen kilometers away.
   Our analysis focused on the diversity and abundance of three pollinator
   groups: bees, flower flies and butterflies contrasted with a single
   non-pollinator group: scuttle flies. Our findings show that the Nature
   Gardens support greater abundance and diversity than any of the nearby
   sites or the natural site for all pollinator taxa examined. In contrast,
   the natural site supported much higher abundance and diversity of the
   non-pollinator scuttle flies when compared to the Nature Gardens.
   Calculated evenness of all taxa was lower in the Nature Gardens than at
   the natural site and Shannon Diversity indices were highest in the
   Nature Gardens for flower flies and butterflies, but lower in the Nature
   Gardens than at the natural site for bees and scuttle flies. These
   results indicate that biodiversity in an urban environment can be
   selectively manipulated through management of green spaces, but may not
   duplicate the communities found in natural spaces. Rather, targeted
   management (through plantings, ground cover and other substrates,
   watering, pest management techniques, etc.) can increase fauna
   predictively to create a ``wildlife spectacle{''} of charismatic
   microfauna.}},

   of monofloral (more than 90\% of a single pollen type or more than 60\%
   if no accessory pollen was present). Quantitatively, Myrtaceae pollen
   samples followed Melastomataceae ones. Bifloral or heterofloral samples
   combine several pollen types. Besides Myrcia and Eucalyptus, the most
   frequent pollen types were Solanum, Mimosacaesalpiniifolia and
   Alchornea. The current study was related to the apiaries' surrounding
   vegetation and reflected both the resources available and the preference

Abstract = {{The European bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, is an excellent commercial
   pollinator. In Japan, B. terrestris is categorized as an invasive alien
   species, and the use of the bee is restricted. In this study, we
   identify the native bumble bee Bombus hypocrita sapporoensis as a
   candidate commercial pollinator in Hokkaido Island. To evaluate the risk
   of disturbing the natural genetic structure if this bee is used as a
   commercial pollinator, we sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit I (COI) gene to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship
   of B. h. sapporoensis in Hokkaido Island and the Asian continent. In
   addition, we analyzed six microsatellites to further investigate the
   population genetic structure in Hokkaido Island. The mitochondrial
   analyses revealed that there is little differentiation within Hokkaido
   Island; however, there is considerable differentiation between Hokkaido
   and the Asian continent. Microsatellite analyses using STRUCTURE showed
   that B. h. sapporoensis in Hokkaido was divided into two genetic groups.
   Individuals belonging to each group were distributed throughout Hokkaido
   Island, and no clear geographical differentiation was observed. These
   results indicate that there would be little risk of genetic disturbance
   if bees from Hokkaido Island were used. However, it would be advisable
   to avoid importing continental bees as a pollinating insect in Hokkaido
   Island. El abejorro europeo, Bombus terrestris, es un polinizador

   identificamos el abejorro nativo Bombus hypocrita sapporoensis como un
   candidato de polinizador comercial en la isla Hokkaido. Para evaluar el
   riesgo de perturbacion de la estructura genetica si este abejorro se usa
   como polinizador comercial, secuenciamos el gen de la subunidad I de
   citocromo oxidasa mitocondrial (COI) para elucidar la relacion
   filogenetica de B. h. sapporoensis en la isla de Hokkaido y en el
   continente asiatico. Ademas, analizamos seis microsatelites para
   investigar la estructura genetica poblacional en la isla de Hokkaido.
   Los analisis mitocondriales revelaron que hay poca diferenciacion en la

   dos grupos geneticos. Los individuos pertenecientes a cada grupo se
   distribuian por toda la isla de Hokkaido, y no se observo una clara
   diferenciacion geografica. Estos resultados indican que habria poco

Abstract = {{Ants are a very diverse taxonomic group. They display remarkable social
   organization that has enabled them to be ubiquitous throughout the
   world. They make up approximately 10\% of the world's animal biomass.
   Ants provide ecosystem services in agrosystems by playing a major role
   in plant pollination, soil bioturbation, bioindication, and the
   regulation of crop-damaging insects. Over recent decades, there have
   been numerous studies in ant ecology and the focus on tree cropping
   systems has given added importance to ant ecology knowledge. The only
   missing point in this knowledge is the reasons underlying difference
   between the positive and negative effects of ants in tree cropping
   systems. This review article provides an overview of knowledge of the
   roles played by ants in orchards as functional elements, and on the
   potential of Oecophylla weaver ants as biological control agents. It
   also shows the potential and relevance of using ants as an
   agro-ecological diagnosis tool in orchards. Lastly, it demonstrates the
   potential elements which may determine the divergent negative and
   positive of their effects on cropping systems.}},

Abstract = {{With concerns about declines in pollinating bee species worldwide, there
   is renewed interest in solitary native bee species and their role in
   pollination services. We studied the foraging preferences and foraging
   distances of Lasioglossum sordidum (Halictidae), New Zealand's smallest
   solitary bee, in urban Christchurch. Lasioglossum sordidum were abundant
   within the Christchtuch Botanic Gardens. Pollen samples taken from 40
   bees at each of two nest sites were identified using a pollen reference
   collection from the sites. Bees were collecting pollen from both native
   and exotic plants. In total, pollen from 23 different plant taxa was
   found, but 96\% came from five taxa: Asteraccae (65\%), Hebe spp.
   (16\%), Aesculus spp. (8\%), Yucca baccata (3\%) and Taraxacum
   officinale (3\%). Individual bees usually specialised in a few pollen
   types, with 74\% of bees having >90\% of a single pollen type and a mean
   of 2.6 pollen types per bee. The minimum flight distances to the nearest
   sources of each pollen type were typically 70-250 m. These easily
   overlooked bees may be assisting more in general pollination services
   given the diversity of plant taxa from which the bees were collecting
   pollen, the variation from bee to bee in the plant taxa collected, and
   the sometimes considerable minimum foraging distances exhibited.}},

Title = {{Identifying Green Infrastructure as a Basis for an Incentive Mechanism

Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{The contributions of green infrastructure (GI) to human well-being have
   been widely recognised; however, pathways for its systematic
   implementation are missing. Local governments can play a crucial role in
   the conservation of GI, and a formal recognition of this role in
   budgeting systems would foster the inclusion of GI in their agenda. The
   aim of this study is to identify the principal components of GI at the
   local level to form a basis for a compensatory economic scheme. We
   identified the principal components of GI based on the mapping of
   biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision. Furthermore,
   we analysed the potentiality of an incentive mechanism to promote GI
   based on the protection status of GI. Finally, an incentive mechanism to
   promote GI at the municipality level was proposed. The results showed
   that the GI of Biscay is mainly composed of the natural forests
   presented in the area, and that 50\% of the principal components of the
   GI are not protected. Furthermore, one third of the protected principal
   components of the GI only has protection at the municipality level. So,
   we propose a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES)-like scheme at the
   municipality level based on the cover of natural forests, where the
   objective is the conservation and promotion of the GI.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the building of urban socialism in the port city
   of Dalian from 1945 through the mid-1950s. Hailed by the Chinese
   Communist Party (CCP) in 1949 as New China's model metropolis, this
   former Japanese colonial city was occupied by the Soviet military until
   1950. Postwar geopolitics situated Dalian and its residents at the
   forefront of implementing Soviet-inspired reforms that led to an image
   of Dalian not only as a vanguard city of the People's Republic, but one
   intimately connected with the larger socialist world. The article argues
   that Dalian's postwar geopolitical position as a Sino-Soviet space led
   to a cross-pollination of attitudes, actions, and policies that differed
   from much of the urban scene throughout the People's Republic of China.
   It sheds new light on how the complex decolonization process of the
   early Cold War brought a Chinese city more closely into the Second
   World.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous abiotic factors have an important impact on the phenology of
   woody plants with temperature as the main driver of their development.
   Furthermore, the biological factors connected with phenotypic plasticity
   and genetic heterogeneity might be the cause of differentiation in
   phenological response to abiotic factors. As objects of our study, we
   chose black alder and silver birch trees. The main aims of the study
   were to demonstrate the spatial and temporal diversity in the timing of
   Alnus glutinosa and Betula pendula pollination as well as to identify
   factors affecting these variations. We focused on abiotic factors such
   as thermal conditions: air and surface temperatures, within and between
   population variability. Phenological observations were carried out in
   Rzeszow (SE Poland) in a period of four years at over a dozen locations.
   Stands differed in their thermal conditions and prevalent land use
   types. The pollination pattern in the study area was presented against
   the background of local thermal conditions which were described by Land
   Surface Temperature (LST) and maximum daily air temperature. LST was
   estimated with a single-channel algorithm using satellite images
   obtained from Landsat 7 and 8. Our results showed great spatial and
   temporal diversity in the pollination pattern in the study area.
   Year-to-year variations in the B. pendula pollination pattern were less
   pronounced than in the case of A. glutinosa. The pollination pattern was
   strongly influenced by temperature before and during pollination. In the
   study area, the variability of LST was greater than that of air
   temperature but the relationships between the timing of pollination
   phenophases and LST or land use types were weak. It was observed that
   the same sites were similar in their pollination pattern - the timing of
   phenophases was `accelerated' or `delayed' during the whole study
   period. The same individuals were the first or the last that began to
   pollinate independently of the year. We concluded that despite the
   impact of temperature on A. glutinosa and B. pendula development, the
   phenotype of an individual tree might be as important for phenological
   variability as local climate.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Certain pesticides are coming under scrutiny because of their impact on
   pollinator insects. Although most consumers express willingness to aid
   pollinators, the reasons for consumers' preferences or barriers to
   purchasing pollinator-friendly plants and the types of pollinators' that
   consumers are trying to protect are less understood. Using an online
   survey of 1200 Connecticut (CT) consumers, of which 841 had home
   landscapes, we find that 46\% of consumers with home landscapes
   purchased pollinator-friendly plants to attract pollinators to their
   landscape. Consistent with past research that focused on consumers'
   preferences for pollinator-friendly plants, the data also reveal that
   some consumers are willing to pay premiums for plants that contribute to
   pollinator's health. However, only 17\% stated that attracting
   pollinators was their primary motivation; a finding that suggests
   labeling alone will likely not motivate consumers to purchase plants.
   The major barriers to purchasing pollinator-friendly plants included
   lack of labeling (cited by 28\%), followed by high price (28\%).
   Consumers purchasing pollinator-friendly plants were trying to attract
   butterflies (Lepidoptera) (78\%), bees (Apidae) (59\%), hummingbirds
   (Trochilidae) (59\%), and other birds (41\%). We also find that
   demographics and purchasing behavior affect barriers and types of
   pollinators desired. Simply labeling plants has the potential to
   increase purchasing, but increasing price could be detrimental as many
   consumers feel pollinator-friendly plants are highly priced.
   Implications for ornamental horticulture stakeholders are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Apocephalus borealis phorid flies, a parasitoid of bumble bees and
   yellow jacket wasps in North America, was recently reported as a novel
   parasitoid of the honey bee Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera:
   Apidae). Little is known about the ecology of this interaction,
   including phorid fecundity on bee hosts, whether phorid-bee parasitism
   is density dependent, and which local habitat and landscape features may
   correlate with changes in parasitism rates for either bumble or honey
   bees. We examined the impact of local and landscape drivers and host
   abundance on phorid parasitism of A. mellifera and the bumble bee Bombus
   vosnesenskii Radoszkowski (Hymenoptera: Apidae). We worked in 19 urban
   gardens along the North-Central Coast of California, where phorid
   parasitism of honey bees was first reported in 2012. We collected and
   incubated bees for phorid emergence, and surveyed local vegetation,
   ground cover, and floral characteristics as well as land cover types
   surrounding gardens. We found that phorid parasitism was higher on
   bumble bees than on honey bees, and phorids produced nearly twice as
   many pupae on individual bumble bee hosts than on honey bee hosts.
   Parasitism of both bumble and honey bees increased with abundance of
   honey bees in a site. Differences in landscape surroundings did not
   correlate with parasitism, but local factors related to bee resource
   provisioning (e.g., tree and shrub abundance) positively correlated with
   increased parasitism. This research thus helps to document and describe
   conditions that may have facilitated phorid fly host shift to honey bees
   and further elucidate how resource provisioning in urban gardens
   influences bee-parasite interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Tecomella undulata is valued for beautiful flowers, resistance against
   extreme temperature and drought, stabilizing shifting sand dunes,
   medicinal properties and wood production. In spite of massive flowering,
   the species is seedless. The present study examines the causes of its
   sterility indicating on pollen characteristics. Flowers were hand
   pollinated by pollen of either self-or outcross pollen. Some flowers
   were tagged as open pollination treatment. Pollen structure, in situ and
   in vitro pollen germination and pollen tube growth were analyzed. Mature
   pollen grains are heteromorphic, mostly heterogeneous sized as small and
   large. Both pollen grains types are prolate and tricolpate with
   rugulate-reticulate sculpture. Flowers are protandrous and have long
   stylus; a nectariferous tissue secreting abundant nectar exists in the
   ovary base. No effective pollinator visited flowers during the
   observation period. No pollen germination and pollen tube growth were
   observed in self-and cross-pollinated styles and under in vitro
   condition. It seems that pollen heterogeneity, lack of pollinators and
   pollen limitation, the failure of autogamy due to protandry or long
   styli as well as self incompatibility resulted in pollen sterility and
   seedlessness. In addition, probably polyploidy and cytomixis affect
   infertility too that needs to be studied in detail in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Legacies of lead contamination present challenges in the management of
   urban greenspaces for beneficial insect conservation. In particular, the
   sublethal effects of lead contamination on bee foraging behavior could
   negatively impact plant-pollinator interactions and the sustainability
   of urban agriculture. It is difficult, however, to distinguish between
   differences in foraging behavior caused by lead contamination directly
   as compared to differences resulting from variation in floral traits,
   which can also be affected by contamination. We compared the foraging
   behavior of bees, specifically the number of visits and visit duration,
   at sunflowers grown in lead-contaminated and uncontaminated soils. We
   also measured soil lead contamination's effects on sunflower
   morphological traits. While the number of visits a sunflower head
   received was not affected by soil lead contamination, bee visit duration
   was shorter at sunflowers grown in lead contaminated soil. This effect
   of lead contamination on visit duration was not mediated by sunflower
   floral traits, which were themselves affected by lead contamination. The
   inability of bees to distinguish between sunflowers grown in
   contaminated vs. uncontaminated soil prior to visitation suggests a
   possible bioaccumulation pathway for lead in bees.}},

Abstract = {{Based on current research the agglomerations are potentially desirable
   habitats for bumblebees. However, the relationship between the
   biodiversity of these bees and the green areas where they live is poorly
   understood. The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of green
   areas (ranging from 8 to 102 ha) of big cities on bumblebee species
   richness, composition, and the relative number of these insects. The
   studies were conducted within the administrative borders of the city of
   Wrocaw (Poland) in 2011-2012 in 12 green areas such as parks, cemeteries
   and other places with trees and shrubs. Species richness and abundance
   of bumblebees was determined by direct observation during 30 min. The
   gathered materials were used to calculate how areas of urban green space
   affected qualitative and quantitative bumblebee community structure. In
   total, 13 species of bumblebees (Bombus Latr.) were recorded, of which 3
   belonged to cuckoo bumblebees (Psithyrus subgenus). The share of the
   most similar groups was congregated in green areas not smaller than 30
   ha. This was proved by analysis of qualitative structure (Sorensen
   index), quantitative structure (Renkonen index), and
   qualitative-quantitative structure (Cody's index). The number of
   bumblebee species in the surveyed green areas (r = 0.7497) was decisive
   for the arrangement of the mutual similarity of group structure. Green
   urban areas should be created in a size of at least 30 ha. Such sites
   provide conditions for the most diversified bumblebee species
   communities. Sites smaller than 30 ha can play an important role as
   refuges, and allow migration to all pollinators.}},

Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1849-1858}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Poaceae family comprises over 12 000 wind-pollinated species, which
   release large amounts of pollen into the atmosphere. Poaceae pollen is
   currently regarded as the leading airborne biological pollutant and the
   chief cause of pollen allergy worldwide. Sensitization rates vary by
   country, and those variations are reviewed here. Grass pollen allergens
   are grouped according to their protein structure and function. In
   Poaceae, although species belonging to different subfamilies are
   characterized by distinct allergen subsets, there is a considerable
   degree of cross-reactivity between many species. Cross-reactivity
   between grass pollen protein and fresh fruit pan-allergens is associated
   with the appearance of food allergies. The additional influence of urban
   pollution may prompt a more severe immunological response. The timing
   and the intensity of the pollen season are governed by species genetics,
   but plant phenology is also influenced by climate; as a result, climate
   changes may affect airborne pollen concentrations. This article reviews
   the findings of worldwide research which has highlighted the major
   impact of climate change on plant phenology and also on the prevalence
   and severity of allergic disease.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanisation, associated with habitat fragmentation, affects pollinator
   communities and insect foraging behaviour. These biotic changes are
   likely to select for modified traits in insect-pollinated plants from
   urban populations compared to rural populations. To test this
   hypothesis, we conducted an experiment involving four plant species
   commonly found in both urban and rural landscapes of the AZle-de-France
   region (France): Cymbalaria muralis, Geranium robertianum, Geum urbanum
   and Prunella vulgaris. The four species were grown in four urban and
   four rural experimental sites in 2015. For each species and each
   experimental site, plants were grown from seeds collected in five urban
   and five rural locations. During flowering, we observed flower
   production and insect-flower interactions during 14 weeks and tested for
   the effects of experimental site location and plant origin on flower
   production and on the number of floral visits. The study species had
   various flower morphology and hence were visited by different floral
   visitors. The effect of experimental sites and seed origin also varied
   among study species. We found that (1) insect visits on P. vulgaris were
   more frequent in rural than in urban sites; (2) for C. muralis, the
   slope relating the number of pollinator visits to the number of flowers
   per individual was steeper in urban versus rural sites, suggesting a
   greater benefit in allocating resources to flower production in urban
   conditions; (3) as a likely consequence, C. muralis tended to produce
   more flowers in plants from urban versus rural origin.}},

Abstract = {{The eastern hive bee Apis cerana is a major honeybee species in Asia
   providing numerous ecosystem services. Understanding how much the
   honeybees depend on natural and human-influenced plants and landscapes
   in different climates is important could contribute to evaluate how wild
   honeybees use food resources and to measure the ecosystem services. We
   investigated the effects of land use and climate changes on stable
   nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios in wild populations of A. cerana. In
   populations from 139 individual sites throughout Japan, we measured
   nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotope ratios and
   analyzed the effects of land use and climate. Our results showed that
   forested areas and annual precipitation had significant effects on delta
   N-15, and that paddy fields and urban areas had significant effects on
   delta C-13. These results suggest that A. cerana sensibly uses available
   food resources in the various environments and that stable nitrogen and
   carbon isotope ratios clearly reflect the effects of land use and
   climate changes on the populations of A. cerana. Thus, stable nitrogen
   and carbon isotope ratios in A. cerana, which widely distributes in
   Asia, can be used as indicators of the environments, such as land use
   and climate, of an area within its foraging range.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding system and pollination of woody species in a subtropical forest
   invaded by alien plants. In the riparian forest of Punta Lara (Buenos
   Aires province, Argentina) seven woody bird-dispersed species coexist,
   five of which are native (Ocotea acutifolia, Allophylus edulis, Myrsine
   laetevirens, Blepharocalyx salicifolius and Citharexylum montevidense),
   and two are invasive aliens (Rubus ulmifolius and Ligustrum lucidum).
   While seed dispersal of these species has been studied, other aspects of
   their reproduction are unknown. In this paper we studied the breeding
   systems, the quality of the pollination service they receive and their
   floral visitors. All species are xenogamous. One species (M.
   laetevirens) is anemophilous and the others are visited mostly by
   Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. For most of the native species the
   pollination service seems insufficient. In A. edulis and B. salicifolius
   natural fruit set was lower than that of hand cross-pollinated flowers,
   only O. acutifolia and the two exotic showed stigmatic pollen loads
   sufficient to achieve maximum seed production. A possible explanation
   for the patterns found lies in the reduction of populations of native
   species due to the expansion of the aliens, particularly L. lucidum.}},

Title = {{Urbanization-mediated context dependence in the effect of floral

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{185}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{713-723}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Context dependence in ecological interactions is widespread, but our
   ability to predict how environmental variation will mediate the effects
   of a given interaction remains poor. Co-flowering plants can influence
   visitation of shared pollinators to one another; the effect of these
   interactions varies with ecological context. While research has
   investigated the effect of local biotic conditions on such interactions,
   little is known about how land use change, specifically urbanization,
   affects them. I tested how the interaction of urbanization and
   neighborhood floral density (NFD) and richness affected pollinator
   visitation rates to two crop species, cucumber and sunflower by placing
   experimental arrays of each species in paired high- (garden) and low-
   (lawn) floral density neighborhoods along an urban-to-rural gradient.
   Pollinator visitation to flowers was monitored over 2 years, as was NFD
   and richness. The two plant species showed contrasting responses to both
   urbanization and floral neighborhood density, with only cucumber
   experiencing context dependence in the effect of floral neighborhood.
   These contrasting responses to urbanization and floral neighborhood are
   likely due to differences between species in floral visitor community
   composition. Plants grown in gardens experienced higher pollinator
   visitation regardless of floral neighborhood. This study highlights the
   need for better understanding of genus- or species-specific pollinator
   responses to urbanization to predict the effect of urbanization on
   plant-pollinator interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The role of urban expansion on bee diversity is poorly understood, but
   it may play an important role in restructuring pollinator diversity
   observed in rural regions at the urban perimeter. We studied bee
   communities in two habitats essential for pollinators (residential
   gardens and semi-natural areas) at 42 sites situated at the edge of
   greater Montreal, Canada. Bee species richness, abundance and functional
   diversity all increased with urbanization in both habitat types, but
   gardens and semi-natural areas supported distinct bee communities with
   unique responses to urbanization in terms of species turnover. Compared
   to semi-natural sites, residential gardens supported bees that foraged
   from a greater number but a lower proportion of available plant species.
   Bees did not discriminate between exotic and indigenous plant species in
   either gardens or semi-natural sites and were attracted to flowers in
   either habitat irrespective of their origins. Protecting semi-natural
   ruderal areas and providing residential garden habitats for pollinators
   are both effective means of promoting regional bee diversity in
   urbanizing regions.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Agricultural intensification and urbanization are important drivers
   of biodiversity change in Europe. Different aspects of bee community
   diversity vary in their sensitivity to these pressures, as well as
   independently influencing ecosystem service provision (pollination). To
   obtain a more comprehensive understanding of human impacts on bee
   diversity across Europe, we assess multiple, complementary indices of
   diversity.
   Location: One Thousand four hundred and forty six sites across Europe.
   Methods: We collated data on bee occurrence and abundance from the
   published literature and supplemented them with the PREDICTS database.
   Using Rao's Quadratic Entropy, we assessed how species, functional and
   phylogenetic diversity of 1,446 bee communities respond to land-use
   characteristics including land-use class, cropland intensity, human
   population density and distance to roads. We combined these models with
   statistically downscaled estimates of land use in 2005 to estimate and
   mapat a scale of approximately 1km(2)-the losses in diversity relative
   to semi-natural/natural baseline (the predicted diversity of an
   uninhabited grid square, consisting only of semi-natural/natural
   vegetation).
   Results: We show that-relative to the predicted local diversity in
   uninhabited semi-natural/natural habitat-half of all EU27 countries have
   lost over 10\% of their average local species diversity and two-thirds
   of countries have lost over 5\% of their average local functional and
   phylogenetic diversity. All diversity measures were generally lower in
   pasture and higher-intensity cropland than in semi-natural/natural
   vegetation, but facets of diversity showed less consistent responses to
   human population density. These differences have led to marked spatial
   mismatches in losses: losses in phylogenetic diversity were in some
   areas almost 20 percentage points (pp.) more severe than losses in
   species diversity, but in other areas losses were almost 40pp. less
   severe.
   Main conclusions: These results highlight the importance of exploring
   multiple measures of diversity when prioritizing and evaluating
   conservation actions, as species-diverse assemblages may be
   phylogenetically and functionally impoverished, potentially threatening
   pollination service provision.}},

Abstract = {{The state of Michigan occupies an area between the Great Plains and the
   northeastern United States, bordering four Great Lakes, with diverse
   biogeographical regions. Michigan also has the second most diverse
   agriculture in the country, with many crops that depend on bees for
   pollination. This unique combination provides a wide range of
   opportunities for bees to persist, yet there is no current published
   checklist of these important insects. This study was conducted to
   provide the first annotated checklist of the bee (Apoidea: Anthophila)
   fauna of Michigan, summarizing aspects of their taxonomy and behavior
   and to provide provisional conservation assessment. The list was
   compiled from a critical review of published literature, museum
   specimens, and database records, supplemented by new collections. In
   total, 465 species are included in the checklist, including 38 new
   records, however evidence for 13 species is poor, several more species
   require taxonomic revision, and the presence of additional species is
   expected. The exotic megachilid species Megachile apicalis Spinola, M.
   pusilla Perez (=concinna Smith, auct.) and Osmia taurus Smith are
   reported from Michigan for the first time. New state records of native
   species include Anthidium tenuiflorae Cockerell and Nomada alpha alpha
   Cockerell, both previously undocumented from eastern North America, and
   Nomada sphaerogaster Cockerell, which has rarely been recognized. The
   taxonomy of some bee species is clarified by the formal publication of
   11 new synonymies (some previously reported online or in manuscripts).
   The following list cites junior synonyms first followed by the valid
   name: Andrena chippewaensis Mitchell 1960 = A. (Simandrena) wheeleri
   Graenicher 1904; Osmia hendersoni Cockerell 1907 = O. (Melanosmia)
   tarsata Provancher 1888; Osmia michiganensis Mitchell 1962 = O. (M.)
   subarctica Cockerell 1912 (new status, removed from synonymy with O.
   (M.) tersula Cockerell 1912); Sphecodes persimilis Lovell and Cockerell
   1907 = S. davisii Robertson 1897; Sphecodes knetschi Cockerell 1898 = S.
   dichrous Smith 1853; Sphecodes carolinus Mitchell 1956 = S. coronus
   Mitchell 1956; Sphecodes stygius Robertson 1893 = S. mandibularis
   Cresson 1872; Sphecodes prostygius Mitchell 1960 = S. fattigi Mitchell
   1956; Stelis vernalis Mitchell 1962 = S. coarctatus Crawford 1916; and
   Stelis michiganensis Mitchell 1962 = S. foederalis Smith 1854. Poorly
   known Andrena (Cnemidandrena) are discussed, including A. parnassiae
   Cockerell, a new state record, A. robervalensis Mitchell, and the
   extralimital A. runcinatae Cockerell. Of these, only A. robervalensis
   was considered in the subgeneric revision, but we recognize all three as

Abstract = {{Cross-pollination increases the number of seedy fruit in a wide range of
   Citrus cultivars including self-incompatible cultivars such as
   `Nadorcote mandarin, thereby diminishing the commercial value of the
   crop. Isolated block planting and whole tree net-covering are some of
   the techniques applied to increase seedlessness of cross-pollinated
   varieties. However, in net-covered trees a reduction in yield has been
   reported. The purpose of this work was to study the spatial distribution
   of seedy fruit at different distances from other pollen sources, and to
   evaluate the effect of different fruit set promoting techniques applied
   to covered trees under commercial field conditions. To this aim, four
   experiments were carried out in a commercial orchard of `Nadorcott.
   mandarin to assess: a) the spatial distribution of seed number per fruit
   and seedy fruit under open-pollinated conditions; b) the effect of
   girdling and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) application on fruit set and
   seedless fruit in net-covered trees; and c) seedless fruit number in
   open pollinated trees treated with GA(3) and consecutive copper sulphate
   (CuSO4) sprays. A gradual reduction in the percentage of seedy fruit
   from the pollen source up to 140 m away from where the seedless fruit
   presented a spatially randomized pattern. Net-covered trees reduced the
   number of seedy fruit and the number of seeds per fruit, whereas the
   number of fruits was reduced by 66\%. Under nets, single GA(3) spray,
   but not girdling, impaired fruitlet drop. Six consecutive 25 mg per
   liter or 50 mg per liter sprays of CuSO4 reduced the number of fruit per
   tree, the 50 mg per liter dose increased fruit seedlesness. Single GA(3)
   25 mg per liter sprays or combined with CuSO4 reduced the number of
   seedy fruit with the reduction in fruit per tree.}},

Abstract = {{Ponkan is one of the two easy-peeling mandarins grown in China, and
   `Xinnu' Ponkan (Citrus reticulata Blanco) is a major cultivar in the
   industry. We selected a spontaneous mutant of `Xinnu' named `Zaomi'
   Ponkan. Compared to the wild type, `Zaomi' Ponkan exhibited alternating
   agronomic traits comprising earlier colouring, thinner peel, fewer seeds
   and higher sugar content. Pollen analysis showed that `Zaomi' produced a
   greater number of deformed, nonviable pollen grains. Experiments in
   self-and cross-pollination suggested that self-incompatibility of
   `Zaomi' contributes to the seedlessness of `Zaomi' x `Zaomi'. Fruit
   quality analysis demonstrated that `Zaomi' was a high-sugar mutant that
   was not affected by pollinating combination. This study on the fruit
   characteristics of `Zaomi' indicates that partial male sterility and
   self-incompatibility contributes to fewer or no seeds; natural
   pollination promotes the overall fruit quality of `Zaomi' Ponkan. These
   results provide an explanation of the seed formation of `Zaomi' Ponkan
   and supply information relevant to its commercial planting.}},

Abstract = {{We study how knowledge is produced at the intersection of science,
   environmental policy and public engagement. Based on analysis of monarch
   butterfly conservation, we critically evaluate models of knowledge
   production. The monarch butterfly and its migration have engaged science
   and enchanted people for over a century, and current threats to monarchs
   catalyze debates and actions. This paper traces the historical
   development of knowledge regarding (i) long-term monarch population
   trends, (ii) the monarch's dependence on a particular food plant, the
   milk-weed, and (iii) the monarch as a pollinator. Our analysis indicates
   that knowledge production and science-policy-practice interfaces cannot
   be satisfactorily understood through reference to the classical linear
   model and more recent conceptions of relationally produced knowledge
   (i.e. co-production). We identify powerful and sometimes contradictory
   knowledge claims that emerge from unmediated interactions among
   scientists, advocates, policy makers and diverse publics. The emergent
   model complements existing models of knowledge production, thereby
   expanding the conceptual foundation available for making sense of
   science-policy-practice interfaces. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Spiropiasma mellifenun generally parasitizes honeybees and is one of
   main pathogens causing `bee creeping disease' in China. Spiroplasma
   melliferum can be spread through honeybee pollination, which causes
   severe economic losses to apiculture. The design of this study was based
   on previous studies that utilized an in vitro bioassay to investigate
   the effects of S. melliferum CH-1 infection. We identified invasive S.
   melliferum CH-1 within Apis mellifera using transmission electron
   microscopy and investigated the immune response of honeybees infected
   with S. melliferum CH-1 by assaying the cellular immune response of the
   haemocytes, the plasma level of phenoloxidase activity and the
   transcript levels of 5 antimicrobial peptides, including the Abaecin,
   Apidaecin, Defensin 1, Defensin 2, and Hymenoptaecin gene products. The
   percentage of granulocytes in the haemolymph of infected honeybees was
   significantly higher than those of the controls during the early phase
   of infection, but the percentage of plasmatocytes was significantly
   higher than those of the controls at the fifth day post-infection. The
   phenoloxidase activity of the infected honeybees reached a maximum at
   the second day, and then decreased continuously. Moreover, the
   transcript levels of the 5 evaluated antimicrobial peptide genes were
   significantly increased during the early phase of infection and all 5
   antimicrobial peptides were significantly decreased during the middle
   phase of infection. During the late phase of infection, only Defensin 2
   and Hymenoptaecin showed significantly increased transcription. These
   results suggest that the honeybee immune responses could be activated by
   S. melliferum CH-1 during the early phase of infection and that S.
   melliferum CH-1 is also capable of circumventing the host defensive
   mechanisms to complete its life cycle within the honeybee during the
   middle phase of infection.}},

Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{Native grasses act as host plants, providing food and shelter, for
   numerous Lepidoptera species during their larval stage. As grassland
   habitat decreases because of conversion to agriculture and urban areas,
   prairie specialist butterflies and moths have also declined. Addition of
   native species to urban and agriculture landscapes has been shown to
   benefit Lepidoptera communities in various ways. Native grasses have
   grown in popularity as a landscaping plant due to their low nutrient
   requirements, drought tolerance, and soil stabilization properties.
   However, the benefits of native grasses to Lepidoptera are not well
   known to many entomologists or horticulturists, let alone the average
   consumer. We reviewed the literature that identified native prairie
   graminoids as host plants for native Lepidoptera in Minnesota,
   especially plants widely available in the horticultural trade that could
   be planted for restoration or landscaping purposes. The context of the
   Lepidoptera and host plant associations found in the literature are
   described. In total, we found 36 Lepidoptera species that used 17
   prairie graminoids as host plants cited in the literature. Three native
   grasses, Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash, Andropogon gerardii
   Vitman and Panicum virgatum L. and were found to be used by the most
   Lepidoptera species, 11, 9, and 8, respectively. Most likely there are
   additional moth species that use these grasses as host plants because
   butterfly species tend to be better documented than moth species. The
   specific larval habits and host plant species were unknown for many
   species of moths that feed or are suspected to feed on graminoids,
   showing the need for further research in this area. This information can
   assist horticulturalists, ecologists, landscape planners, land managers,
   and homeowners in their decisions to buy and plant native grass species.
   In general, this knowledge provides increased awareness about the larval
   life stage of butterflies and moths to concerned citizens and green
   industry and further supports the importance of conserving native
   prairie to support and maintain Lepidoptera species.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Solanum (family Solanaceae) includes more than 1400 species
   and has buzz-pollinated flowers with poricidal anthers. The present
   study aimed to describe the distribution, breeding system and
   pollination mechanism of Solanum melissarum, a species endemic to
   Brazil. The study of breeding system was conducted in an urban forest
   fragment in Jatai, GO. Distribution data were gathered from floristic
   surveys and digital plant databases. The floral morphology and the
   pollination mechanism were studied on through field observations and
   preserved flowers. The breeding system was determined through hand
   pollination treatments. The species has a distribution only in the
   Brazilian Atlantic forest coastal, and this study provides the first
   records of S. melissarum for the state of Goias. The pendulous flowers
   have poricidal anthers close to the stigma, with membranous thecae
   joined by a connective bearing osmophores that attract males of Euglossa
   cordata bees. As they collect fragrances, the bees press the thecae and
   pollen is released through a bellows mechanism. Based on the
   hand-pollination treatments, this species is self-incompatible. Isolated
   forest fragments may not include enough pollinators to ensure the
   pollination of plants with specialized systems. However, they are
   essential for the conservation of species with interesting
   phytogeographic patterns, such as the vicariance observed in S.
   melissarum, and for the conservation of regional diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of an alien plant is widely assumed to have negative
   consequences for the pollinator-mediated fitness of nearby natives.
   Indeed, a number of studies, including a highly cited meta-analysis,
   have concluded that the trend for such interactions is competitive. Here
   we provide evidence that publication bias and study design have obscured
   our ability to assess the pollinator-mediated impacts of alien plants.
   In a meta-analysis of 76 studies, we demonstrate that alien/native
   status does not predict the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions
   among plants. Moreover, we found no evidence that similarity in floral
   traits or phylogenetic distance between species pairs influences the
   outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions. Instead, we report that
   aspects of study design, such as distance between the control and
   nearest neighbour, and/or the arrangement of study plants better predict
   the impact of a neighbour than does alien/native status. Our study sheds
   new light on the role that publication bias and experimental design play
   in the evaluation of key patterns in ecology. We conclude that, due to
   the absence of clear, generalisable pollinator-mediated impacts of alien
   species, management schemes should base decisions on community-wide
   assessments of the impacts of individual alien plant species, and not
   solely on alien/native status itself.}},

Abstract = {{Fruit cracking is an economically important issue in breeding and
   production of watermelon, Citrullus lanatus. The physiological and
   genetic basis of watermelon fruit cracking is not well understood. In
   the present study, we compared the fruit pericarp anatomic structure and
   enzyme activities in two mini-watermelon inbred lines: the crack
   resistant line K2 with thick pericarp (similar to 1.0 cm) and the crack
   prone line L1 with thin pericarp(similar to 0.6cm). Microscopic
   structures of the two lines were examined by paraffin sectioning of the
   fruit pericarps that were sampled 21, 24, 27 and 30 days after
   pollination. The stone cells in the crack-resistant K2 were smaller and
   more round-shaped than those in the crack-susceptible line L1. An
   obvious transition from the small to big cells was observed in the
   crack-resistant line. Variation in the degree of pericarp structure of
   the crack-resistant was more obvious than of the crack-susceptible lines
   at late fruit development.
   Fruit-cracking resistance was associated with the variation and
   arrangement of pericarp structure in the process of mini-watermelon
   maturity. At the same time, the fruit pericarps that were sampled 30
   days after self-pollination were observed for the activities of four
   enzymes. The activities of the pectinase, cellulose and peroxidase (POD)
   in the thin pericarp L1 were higher than those in the crack-resistant
   line K2. Cracking tendency and pectinase activity in the pericarp were
   positively and significantly correlated whereas pericarp thickness and
   pectinase activity were negatively correlated. Information obtained the
   present study is useful in understanding the mechanisms of cracking
   resistance in watermelon.}},

Title = {{Can powerline clearings be managed to promote insect-pollinated plants
   and species associated with semi-natural grasslands?}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{419-428}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Powerline clearings are common in urban and semi-urban landscapes
   worldwide. The clearings could potentially promote flowering species
   associated with open-canopy habitats, and provide alternative habitat
   for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands, but the empirical
   evidence for this hypothesis is weak. We carried out a large-scale field
   study of understorey plant communities at 51 sites in powerline
   clearings and adjacent boreal forest. At each site, we placed four 4 m x
   5 m plots with five 1-m(2) subplots in the clearing centre and a
   parallel set of plots 100 m into the adjacent forest. Habitat
   characteristics were sampled at plot and site level and from digital
   maps. The clearings had a higher richness of species associated with
   semi-natural grasslands, and a higher richness of shade-tolerant and
   shade-intolerant forb species. Total plant richness and diversity were
   higher in the clearings than in the forests. The magnitude of difference
   in species composition between clearings and forest, and plant community
   properties in the clearings, depended on the environmental context (age
   of the clearing, productivity, shading by tree regrowth, landscape
   fragmentation, climate). Our results indicate that over time, powerline
   clearings develop into novel habitats. Low-productive sites were
   dominated by Ericaceaous dwarfs shrubs. Richness of forbs and
   semi-natural grassland species in the clearings increased with
   productivity. Richness of shade-intolerant forbs and semi-natural
   grassland species increased with fragmentation of the surrounding
   landscape. We conclude that frequent clearing of productive sites can
   enhance plant biodiversity including richness of insect-pollinated
   species and mitigate the loss of species associated with semi-natural
   grasslands.}},

Title = {{Allergenic pollen of ornamental plane trees in a Mediterranean
   environment and urban planning as a prevention tool}},
Journal = {{URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{352-362}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Green spaces and urban green infrastructure are new concepts in urban
   planning, and lately, the influence of green spaces in cities and how
   this presence affects local climate change have been taken into account.
   Moreover, some of the ornamental trees most used in cities provoke
   allergic symptoms in sensitized people. Due to the importance the plane
   trees in our parks and cities have as ornamental trees, this article
   assesses the urban Platanus airborne pollen concentration in the air of
   five cities of the SW Iberian Peninsula and tries to determine the
   differential factors that its distribution has by means of combining
   continuous monitoring of the air using volumetric spore traps and the
   geolocation of plane trees. They were counted separately according to
   the direction (Q1 NE, Q2 SE, Q3 SW, Q4 NW) around the spore trap
   location in circles of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 and
   2500 m in diameter. Pollen sums were distributed according to the
   predominant wind direction for each day. The highest concentrations for
   Platanus pollen were recorded in Don Benito. Differences amongst pollen
   stations were found and were mainly related to their degree of maturity
   and their proximity to spore traps, and finally, with the number of
   plane trees. Furthermore, other factors, as the pruning, which is
   different in each city and even in a more local way, affects pollination
   and is frequently unknown to aerobiological studies. The geolocation of
   ornamental trees can be a useful tool for providing summarized
   information about their behavioral differences amongst cities, which can
   be used to create healthy itineraries, minimizing the natural hazards in
   human health (allergic diseases) and could be implemented into a model
   to help policy-makers to create measures to improve green urban
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of the spatial variability of apple yield as early as
   possible in the season is very important for farm managers. Many
   researchers used colour images of the apple trees and algorithms in
   order to develop prediction models of apple yield. The objective of this
   research was to study the spatial variability in an apple orchard and to
   develop methods for predicting yield variability within the growing
   period and as early as possible to permit management decisions. A
   commercial point-and-shoot and a multi-spectral camera were utilised to
   obtain images of the apple trees during the flowering period under
   daylight in a cv. Fuji apple orchard in Greece. The images were taken in
   April 2010 and 2011. Fruit yield was recorded at harvest each year.
   Supervised classification was used to isolate and calculate the flowers'
   pixel density of the whole image. For both years of the study, the
   results showed that, with both cameras, the estimated distribution of
   the flowers was correlated with the final yield distribution; however,
   for the second year, the correlation was slightly lower, probably due to
   adverse climatic conditions during and after the pollination period,
   which resulted in low yield. Multi-spectral images gave the best results
   in both years (r = 0.859 in 2010 and r = 0.827 in 2011).}},

   response in reciprocal crosses. In this answer to their comment, we
   present original results based on reciprocal stigma tests that
   contradict conclusions from these studies. We show that, in our hands,
   not a single case of asymmetry was confirmed, endorsing that symmetry of
   incompatibility reactions seems to be the rule in Olive. We discuss
   three important aspects that were not taken into account in the studies
   cited in their comments and that can explain the discrepancy: (i) the
   vast uncertainty around the actual genetic identity of vernacular
   varieties, (ii) the risk of massive contamination associated with the
   pollination protocols that they used and (iii) the importance of
   checking for stigma receptivity in controlled crosses. These studies
   were thus poorly genetically controlled, and we stand by our original
   conclusion that Olive tree exhibits DSI.}},

Abstract = {{Recent declines in pollinator populations have led to widespread concern
   due to their impact on food/crop production and the environment.
   Contrary to growing interest in the use of insecticides in urban
   landscapes, the relationship between pollinator-related eco-labels,
   visual attention, and preferences for plants is less understood. The
   present study combines eye tracking and stated preference experiments to
   examine the effects of pollinator-related labels on consumers'
   preferences and willingness to pay. Results show that the
   pollinator-friendly attribute positively correlates with consumers'
   purchasing decisions and visual attention supports that relationship.
   Implications of mandatory labeling of pesticide content for the
   horticultural industry are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In urban landscapes, gardens provide refuges for bee diversity, but
   conservation potential may depend on local and landscape features.
   Foraging and population persistence of bee species, as well as overall
   pollinator community structure, may be supported by the abundance,
   richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources. Floral resources
   strongly differ in urban gardens. Using hand netting and pan traps to
   survey bees, we examined whether abundance, richness, and spatial
   distribution of floral resources, as well as ground cover and garden
   landscape surroundings influence bee abundance, species richness, and
   diversity on the central coast of California. Differences in floral
   abundance and spatial distribution, as well as urban cover in the
   landscape, predicted different bee community variables. Abundance of all
   bees and of honeybees (Apis mellifera) was lower in sites with more
   urban land cover surrounding the gardens. Honeybee abundance was higher
   in sites with patchy floral resources, whereas bee species richness and
   bee diversity was higher in sites with more clustered floral resources.
   Surprisingly, bee species richness and bee diversity was lower in sites
   with very high floral abundance, possibly due to interactions with
   honeybees. Other studies have documented the importance of floral
   abundance and landscape surroundings for bees in urban gardens, but this
   study is the first to document that the spatial arrangement of flowers
   strongly predicts bee abundance and richness. Based on these findings,
   it is likely that garden managers may promote bee conservation by
   managing for floral connectivity and abundance within these ubiquitous
   urban habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Recent analyses suggesting that certain populations of bees may be
   declining have led to a variety of conservation efforts, many of which
   rely on public support and participation. However, little is known about
   the public's knowledge of bee diversity. We carried out a survey to
   measure public understanding of bee diversity and found that although
   99\% of respondents believed that bees are critical or important, only
   14\% were able to guess within 1000 the actual number of bee species in
   the US. Furthermore, when reviewing a selection of photographs depicting
   various insects, many respondents were unable to discern bees from
   non-bees. Our findings show that even as scientific research on bees has
   rapidly expanded, the public remains largely uninformed on the subject,
   especially with regard to the wealth of bee diversity in the US. In
   light of the fact that conservation efforts require substantial public
   support, any programs aimed at stopping or mitigating bee population
   declines will need to include outreach and education measures.}},

Abstract = {{` Consumer horticulture (CH) programming can result in outcomes and
   impacts at the individual level, such as money saved by reducing inputs,
   greater return on the landscape investment, healthier plants, and
   improved quality of life. It may also lead to community-level impacts
   that provide public value, such as water quality protection, water
   conservation, and protection of biodiversity. In addition to documenting
   such outcomes and impacts, it is important to quantify their economic
   value, connect the value to actions taken by extension audiences, and
   demonstrate to extension's stakeholders a return on investment. However,
   it is difficult to document the economic contributions of consumer
   horticulture and even more difficult to document the economic impact of
   consumer horticulture extension programs. CH reaches individuals and
   communities directly and indirectly through personal gardens and
   landscapes, indoor flowers and plants, school and community gardens, and
   horticulture therapy. The economic contributions and benefits of
   consumer horticulture are challenging to quantify, but can be evaluated
   using several different strategies, including measuring the consumer
   dollars spent and the economy driven by consumers' purchase of gardening
   supplies and landscape services. A second strategy is to examine the
   value of consumers' gardening actions on environmental ecosystem
   services that support soils and plants, provide food and raw materials,
   and regulate functions, such as pollination, storm water catchment,
   water quality preservation, green waste reduction, and wildlife habitat
   and diversity. A third strategy is to focus on cultural, social, and
   health system services, such as education, recreation, and therapy, that
   result in exercise, nutrition, health, and happiness. Using a
   combination of these strategies, workgroups of Tennessee extension
   professionals are balancing the feasibility of data collection with the
   usefulness of the data gathered by developing realistic and robust
   outcome indicators that will form the basis for local and statewide
   reporting.}},

Abstract = {{Mangrove forests worldwide undergo anthropogenic fragmentation that may
   threatentheir existence, and yet there have been few tests of the
   effects of fragmentation on demographic processes critical for mangrove
   regeneration. Predicting the effects of habitat fragmentation on
   mangroves is problematic as pollinators may move more freely across
   water than terrestrial habitat, and propagules can be widely dispersed
   by water. Here, within each of two estuaries, we compared pollinator
   diversity and activity, reproductive effort and output, and rates of
   recruitment for sets of three large (>1500 trees), medium (300-500) and
   small (<50) stands. As predicted, most measures of reproductive activity
   and success were inversely related to stand size with large stands
   typically producing significantly more and larger fruit, and
   significantly more seedlings. Most strikingly, we found the effect of
   fragmentation on the abundance of pollinators (honeybees), the
   production and quality of fruit and the survival rate of seedlings to be
   similar, showing significant reduction of recruitment in small stands.
   This study provides the first rigorous evidence that recruitment of
   mangroves, like for many terrestrial plants, is negatively impacted by
   habitat fragmentation. From a management perspective, we argue that in
   the short term our data imply the importance of conserving the largest
   possible stands. However, additional work is needed to determine (1) the
   proportion of recruits within small stands that originate within large
   stands, (2) how seedling performance varies with fruit size and
   genotype, and (3) how seedling size and performance vary with the
   abundance and diversity of pollen.}},

Abstract = {{In eastern North America, the field milkweed, Asclepias syriaca L.
   (Asclepiadaceae), is used in planting schemes to promote biodiversity
   conservation for numerous insects including the endangered monarch
   butterfly, Danaus plexippus (Linnaeus) (Nymphalidae). Less is known
   about its pollinators, and especially in urban habitats where it is
   planted often despite being under increasing pressure from invasive
   plant species, such as the related milkweed, the dog-strangling vine
   (DSV), Vincetoxicum rossicum (Kleopow) Barbar. (Asclepiadaceae). During
   the A.syriaca flowering period in July 2016, we surveyed bees in open
   habitats along a DSV invasion gradient and inspected 433 individuals of
   25 bee species in 12 genera for pollinia: these were affixed to bees
   that visited A.syriaca for nectar and contain pollen packets that are
   vectored (e.g., transferred) between flowers. Of all bees sampled,
   pollinia were found only on the nonindigenous honeybee, Apis mellifera
   (43\% of all bees identified), as well as one individual bumblebee,
   Bombus impatiens Cresson. Pollinia were recorded from 45.2\% of all
   honeybees collected. We found no relationship between biomass of DSV and
   biomass of A.syriaca per site. There was a significant positive
   correlation between A.syriaca biomass and the number of pollinia, and
   the proportion vectored. No relationship with DSV biomass was detected
   for the number of pollinia collected by bees but the proportion of
   vectored pollinia declined with increasing DSV biomass. Although we find
   no evidence of DSV flowers attracting potential pollinators away from
   A.syriaca and other flowering plants, the impacts on native
   plant-pollinator mutualisms relate to its ability to outcompete native
   plants. As wild bees do not appear to visit DSV flowers, it could be
   altering the landscape to one which honeybees are more tolerant than
   native wild bees.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators such as bees and hoverflies are essential components of an
   urban ecosystem, supporting and contributing to the biodiversity,
   functioning, resilience and visual amenity of green infrastructure.
   Their urban habitats also deliver health and well-being benefits to
   society, by providing important opportunities for accessing nature
   nearby to the homes of a growing majority of people living in towns and
   cities. However, many pollinator species are in decline, and the loss,
   degradation and fragmentation of natural habitats are some of the key
   drivers of this change. Urban planners and other practitioners need
   evidence to carefully prioritise where they focus their resources to
   provide and maintain a high quality, multifunctional green
   infrastructure network that supports pollinators and people. We provide
   a modelling framework to inform green infrastructure planning as a
   nature based solution with social and ecological benefits. We show how
   habitat suitability models (I-ISM) incorporating remote sensed
   vegetation data can provide important information on the influence of
   urban landcover composition and spatial configuration on species
   distributions across cities. Using Edinburgh, Scotland, as a case study
   city, we demonstrate this approach for bumble bees and hoverflies,
   providing high resolution predictive maps that identify pollinator
   habitat hotspots and pinch points across the city. By combining this
   spatial HSM output with health deprivation data, we highlight `win-win'
   opportunity areas in most need of improved green infrastructure to
   support pollinator habitat quality and connectivity, as well as societal
   health and well-being. In addition, in collaboration with municipal
   planners, local stakeholders, and partners from a local greenspace
   learning alliance, we identified opportunities for citizen engagement
   activities to encourage interest in wildlife gardening as part of a
   `pollinator pledge'. We conclude that this quantitative, spatially
   explicit and transferable approach provides a useful decision-making
   tool for targeting nature-based solutions to improve biodiversity and
   increase environmental stewardship, with the aim of providing a more
   attractive city to live, work and invest in.}},

Title = {{The impact of land-use change on water-related ecosystem services: a

Abstract = {{Land-use change is a significant driver of ecosystem service changes.
   This paper explores how land-use change affects water-related ecosystem
   services (e.g., water yield, water purification, and soil conservation)
   in the Guishui River Basin, Beijing, China. Water-related ecosystem
   services in the Basin are vitally important for Beijing, which currently
   faces a severe water crisis. Understanding the impacts of land-use
   change on water-related ecosystem services is essential for effectively
   managing this crisis. To this end, the study first analyzed land-use
   change and corresponding variations in water-related ecosystem services
   in the Basin from 1980 to 2011. The analysis showed that increases in
   woodland and construction land enhanced water yield and soil
   conservation services while reforestation and urbanization degraded
   water purification services. The paper then developed four
   spatially-explicit land: use scenarios, corresponding to water
   conservation, agricultural expansion, a combination, and soil
   conservation. Each scenario quantified the impact of future land-use
   changes on water-related ecosystem services. This research found that
   water purification and soil conservation services increased under both
   the water conservation and soil conservation scenarios, while these
   services decreased under the agricultural expansion scenario. Water
   yield also increased under the soil conservation scenario. Overall, the
   paper shows that ecosystem services are spatially specific and greatly
   affected by different scenarios. This finding underscores the value of
   studies to improve land management practices. In particular, this
   research would be useful for those policymakers and stakeholders that
   intend to forecast the impacts of alternative land-use policies on
   water-related ecosystem services. The limitations and shortcomings of
   this study, including accuracy in estimating ecosystem services, are
   discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{AimBiodiversity is rapidly disappearing at local and global scales also
   affecting the functional diversity of ecosystems. We aimed to assess
   whether functional diversity was correlated with species diversity and
   whether both were affected by similar land use and vegetation structure
   drivers. Better understanding of these relationships will allow us to
   improve our predictions regarding the effects of future changes in land
   use on ecosystem functions and services.
   LocationThe Netherlands.
   MethodsWe compiled a dataset of c.3 million observations of 66 out of
   106 known Dutch butterfly species collected across 6,075 sampling
   locations during a period of 7 years, together with very high-resolution
   maps of land use and countrywide vegetation structure data. Using a
   mixed-effects modelling framework, we investigated the relationship
   between functional and species diversity and their main land use and
   vegetation structure drivers.
   ResultsWe found that high species diversity does not translate into high
   functional diversity, as shown by their different spatial distribution
   patterns in the landscape. Functional and species diversity are mainly
   driven by different sets of structural and land use parameters
   (especially average vegetation height, amount of vegetation between 0.5
   and 2m, natural grassland, sandy soils vegetation, marsh vegetation and
   urban areas). We showed that it is a combination of both vegetation
   structural characteristics and land use variables that defines
   functional and species diversity.
   Main conclusionsFunctional diversity and species diversity of
   butterflies are not consistently correlated and must therefore be
   treated separately. High functional diversity levels occurred even in
   areas with low species diversity. Thus, conservation actions may differ
   depending on whether the focus is on conservation of high functional
   diversity or high species diversity. A more integrative analysis of
   biodiversity at both species and trait levels is needed to infer the
   full effects of environmental change on ecosystem functioning.}},

Title = {{Ignoring Ecosystem-Service Cascades Undermines Policy for
   Multifunctional Agricultural Landscapes}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Over and above food, agricultural landscapes provide citizens with
   crucial public-good ecosystem services, such as biodiversity
   conservation, cultural values, recreational opportunities, and food
   security. Because continuing agricultural intensification undermines the
   ability of landscapes to provide public goods, policies have been
   implemented to preserve landscape multifunctionality, but with limited
   success. We suggest that one reason for this lack of success is that the
   cascading nature of ecosystem services has not been sufficiently
   addressed. While different definitions of multifunctionality emphasize
   different parts of the service cascades, we argue that efficient
   policies targeting multifunctionality simultaneously need to consider
   ecosystem services along the entire cascade, i.e., both intermediate and
   final ones. By understanding how multiple final ecosystem services are
   promoted by single measures with effects on multiple intermediate
   ecosystem services or by single intermediate ecosystem services with
   effects on multiple final ecosystem services, measures can be identified
   that simultaneously bene fit private and public goods, allowing the
   latter to hitchhike on management for the former. Even if such
   synergistic solutions are less efficient in terms of promoting yields
   compared to non-synergistic solutions, policies such as payment for
   ecosystem services to promote them may be cost-efficient since the
   private bene fit reduces the need for public payment. Furthermore, by
   focusing on the ecosystem service cascade, social-ecological
   scale-mismatches along the cascade hampering the implementation of
   synergistic solutions can be identified and targeted by policy. We
   exemplify our reasoning with the potential bene fit to biodiversity
   conservation from yield-enhancing ecosystem services.}},

Title = {{The grass pollen season 2015: a proof of concept multi-approach study in
   three different European cities}},
Journal = {{WORLD ALLERGY ORGANIZATION JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Grasses release the most widespread aeroallergens with
   considerable sensitization rates, while different species produce
   several pollen concentration peaks throughout the season. This study
   analyzed the prevalence of grass species in three different European
   city areas and compared the flowering period of these species with daily
   pollen concentrations and the symptom loads of grass pollen allergy
   sufferers.
   Methods: The most prevalent grass species in Vienna (Austria), Berlin
   (Germany) and Turku (Finland) were studied and examined by use of three
   different approaches: phenology, pollen monitoring and symptom load
   evaluation. A mobile pollen exposure chamber was employed to observe
   reaction patterns of grass pollen allergy sufferers to three common
   grass species evaluated in this study versus placebo.
   Results: Common meadow grass (Poa pratensis) and the fescue grass
   species (Festuca spp.) are important contributors within the grass
   pollen season. The pollination period of orchard grass (Dactylis
   glomerata) and false-oat grass (Arrhenatherum elatius) indicated a
   greater importance in Berlin and Vienna, whereas a broader spectrum of
   grass species contributed in Turku to the main pollen season. The
   standardized provocation induced a nasal symptom load, reduction in
   nasal flow and increased secretion, in contrary to the placebo control
   group in grass pollen allergic subjects.
   Conclusion: The phenological observations, pollen measurements and
   symptom data evaluation provided unique insights into the contribution
   of multiple grass species in different European regions. All
   investigated grass species in the provocation induced rhinitis symptoms
   of comparable significance, with some degree of variation in symptom
   patterns.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},

Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Urbanization transforms undeveloped landscapes into built environments,
   causing changes in communities and ecological processes. Flying
   arthropods play important roles in these processes as pollinators,
   decomposers, and predators, and can be important in structuring food
   webs. The goal of this study was to identify associations between
   urbanization and the composition of communities of flying (and floating)
   arthropods within gardens and parks in a medium-sized mesic city. We
   predicted that flying arthropod abundance and diversity would respond
   strongly to percent impervious surface and distance to city center,
   measurements of urbanization. Flying arthropods were sampled from 30
   gardens and parks along an urbanization gradient in Toledo, Ohio, during
   July and August 2016, using elevated pan traps. A variety of potential
   predictor variables were also recorded at each site. We collected a
   total of 2,369 individuals representing nine orders. We found that
   flying arthropod community composition was associated with percent
   impervious surface and canopy cover. Overall flying arthropod abundance
   was negatively associated with percent impervious surface and positively
   associated with distance to city center. Hymenoptera (bees, wasps,
   ants), Lepidoptera (moths, butterflies), and Araneae (spiders) were
   positively associated with distance to city center. Hemiptera (true
   bugs), Diptera (flieS), and Araneae were negatively associated with',
   percent impervious surface. Both distance to city center and percent
   impervious surface are metrics of urbanization, and this study shows how
   these factors influence flying arthropod communities in urban gardens
   and city parks, including significant reductions in taxa that contain
   pollinators and predators important to urban agriculture and forestry. A
   variety of environmental factors also showed significant associations
   with responses (e.g. canopy cover and soil moisture), suggesting these
   factors may underlie or modulate the urbanization effects. More research
   is needed to determine mechanisms of change.}},

Abstract = {{We examined spontaneous polyembryony in Lilium lancifolium Thunb. by
   determining the occurrence of polyembryonic seeds in intraspecific
   crosses and open pollination, and by analyzing the genetic origins of
   polyembryos with simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Forty-one
   polyembryonic seeds (0.2\% of total) were detected from 17,583 seeds. Of
   the polyembryonic seeds, 36 were duplets and five were triplets.
   Eighteen seedling sets (three triplets and 15 duplets) were cultured and
   grown to maturity. Flow cytometry revealed that all were diploids, and
   results of analyses with SSR markers indicated that all the multiple
   embryos, except for two triplet seeds, originated from a zygotic embryo
   through cleavage embryony. The SSR profiles confirmed that the seedlings
   from polyembryos resulted from cross-fertilizations and did not from
   unfertilized somatic embryos. Six seedlings rescued from the two
   triplets occurring in 2x x 3x combinations were heterozygous with
   respect to SSR, and thus they may have their origin in multiple embryo
   sacs and/or polyspermy. The occurrence of polyembryonic seeds was
   remarkably greater in one accession collected from Wan-do (Wan island)
   than the others. This suggested that the frequency of polyembryony
   depends on the genotypes of L. lancifolium.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to identify the species of pollen
   supplying plants that constitute the trophic niche of Melipona mandacaia
   in an urban area in the Caatinga domain (a tropical arid landscape). The
   collection of pollen in the colonies was carried out every 15 days, from
   October 2014 to September 2015. The pollen was removed directly from the
   storage pots in three distinct colonies. A total of 24 samples were
   analyzed and compared with the reference pollen collection, pollen
   catalogs and specialized literature. For the quantitative analysis, at
   least 1000 pollen grains per sample were identified. A total of 39
   pollen types were identified, distributed in 17 botanical families,
   being one an indeterminate type. The most represented family was the
   Fabaceae (n = 16). The most frequent types were Leucaena leucocephala,
   Mimosa pudica and Melochia sp. There was a significant positive
   correlation between temperature and the number of pollen types
   throughout the study. Relative humidity and rainfall were abiotic
   variables that did not present a significant correlation. The
   rarefaction curve showed that probably most of the pollen types
   collected by the bees studied were sampled, since the accumulation curve
   showed a progressive tendency to stabilization, indicating that there
   was sample adequacy of the pollen types. The analysis of similarity
   revealed a high sharing of pollen sources between colonies.}},

Abstract = {{The present scenario of urbanization and commercialization has adversely
   affected orchid's population; as a consequence they are diminishing from
   the nature very rapidly. Paphiopedilum insigne (lady's slipper orchid)
   is one such orchid of horticultural importance. Apart from being listed
   as endangered in IUCN red data list; it finds a place in Appendix I of
   CITES in the global platform. In the present study, capsules < 180 days
   after pollination (DAP) were found to be immature and 180 DAP was found
   optimal for seed germination. Capsules > 240 DAP were found to have
   mature seeds that were treated prior to germination and TTC tested for
   viability. Seeds derived from 180 DAP capsules showed the highest
   germination of 88.5\% in modified Burgeff medium (BG1) with initiation
   in 26 days. Incorporation of plant growth regulators like 5 mu M kinetin
   (KN) + 10 mu M indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in 1/2 MS medium influenced
   the stage-wise development of the seedlings in a short duration. Mature
   seeds stored at-196 degrees C for 360 days followed by pre-treatmentwith
   3\% NaOCl showed viability of 70.5\% and recorded germination of 79.2\%.
   Sixty-nine percent of the plantlets were successfully hardened and

Abstract = {{Warming temperatures have been linked to advancing spring migration
   dates of birds, although most studies have been conducted at individual
   sites. Problems may arise ecologically if birds arrive or depart before
   or after associated food resources such as plants or insects reach
   critical lifecycle stages. Here, I compare mean first arrival dates of
   the Rufous Hummingbird (Selasphorus rufus), a prolific pollinator and
   long-distance migrant with the northernmost breeding range of any North
   American hummingbird, between 1895-1969 and 2006-2015 at eight
   observation locations in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.
   Historical arrivals were reported through the North American Bird
   Phenology Program, and recent arrivals were estimated from temporal
   occupancy patterns using eBird checklists. Results indicated that
   hummingbirds arrived 8 and 11 days later in the recent time period in
   two coastal cities in Oregon and 7-17 days earlier in northern, more
   inland cities in Washington and British Columbia. Fewer days were noted
   between arrivals in more northerly areas in the recent time period
   suggesting that birds may now be migrating faster than in the previous
   time period. Spring temperatures have increased in the past century in
   much of this region, and birds arrived earlier in years with warmer
   spring temperatures to suggest that migratory advances are
   climate-related. Later mean first arrivals reported in coastal regions
   of Oregon in the recent time period may suggest that Rufous Hummingbirds
   are bypassing coastal areas to take advantage of more predictable
   conditions along inland migratory routes or are shifting their breeding
   ranges northward, notions both supported by declining population trends
   observed in Breeding Bird Survey data. My results demonstrate a
   climate-related advancement of Rufous Hummingbirds in western North
   America and provide justification for the investigation of the
   ecological impacts of climate change on birds in coastal vs. inland
   environments. In addition, I provide a framework for comparing
   information from two extensive and emerging datasets to better
   understand the impacts of climate change on birds at broad spatial and
   temporal scales.}},

   linden (Tilia tomentosa)}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{For decades, linden trees (basswoods or lime trees), and particularly
   silver linden (Tilia tomentosa), have been linked to mass bee deaths.
   This phenomenon is often attributed to the purported occurrence of the
   carbohydrate mannose, which is toxic to bees, in Tilia nectar. In this
   review, however, we conclude that fromexisting literature there is no
   experimental evidence for toxicity to bees in linden nectar. Bee deaths
   on Tilia probably result from starvation, owing to insufficient nectar
   resources late in the tree's flowering period. We recommend ensuring
   sufficient alternative food sources in cities during late summer to
   reduce bee deaths on silver linden. Silver lindenmetabolites such as
   floral volatiles, pollen chemistry and nectar secondary compounds remain
   underexplored, particularly their toxic or behavioural effects on bees.
   Some evidence for the presence of caffeine in linden nectar may mean
   that linden trees can chemically deceive foraging bees to make
   sub-optimal foraging decisions, in some cases leading to their
   starvation.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing recognition in academic circles of the importance of
   adaptive governance for the sustainability of social-ecological systems,
   but little examination of specific implications for the 34\% of land-use
   where human activities are pervasive but potentially commensurate with
   functioning ecosystems: agricultural production systems. In this paper,
   we argue for the need to view food systems and agro-ecosystems as
   multi-scalar complex adaptive systems and identify five key challenging
   characteristics of such systems: multi-causality; cumulative impacts;
   regime shifts; teleconnections and mismatch of scales. These
   characteristics are necessary features of multi-scalar adaptive systems,
   and apply equally to social and natural subsystems. We discuss the
   implications of these characteristics for agricultural production
   systems and consider how governance can rise to these challenges. We
   present five case studies that highlight these issues: pollinator
   declines; payments for ecosystem services; pest control and pesticide
   resistance; downstream aquatic systems in Tasman Bay, New Zealand; and
   riparian buffers in Puget Sound, USA. From these case studies we derive
   recommendations for managing agricultural systems, both specific and
   general. Ultimately, adaptive governance of agro-ecosystems will likely
   hinge upon three paradigm shifts: viewing farmers and ranchers not only
   as food producers but also as land and water managers; seeking not yield
   maximization but rather resilient management of food ecosystems; and
   critically, as it transcends the production-system literature, engaging
   broad audiences not only as consumers but also citizens.}},

Abstract = {{Urban centers are important foci for plant biodiversity and yet
   widespread planting of wildflower gardens in cities to sustain
   pollinator biodiversity is on the rise, without full consideration of
   potential ecological consequences. The impact of intentional wildflower
   plantings on remnant native plant diversity in urban and peri-urban
   settings has not received attention, although shared pollinators are
   likely to mediate several types of biotic interactions between
   human-introduced plants and remnant native ones. Additionally, if
   wildflower species escape gardens these indirect effects may be
   compounded with direct ones. We review the potential positive and
   negative impacts of wildflower gardens on urban native flowering plants,
   and we reveal substantial gaps in our knowledge. We present a roadmap
   for research to address whether wildflower gardens, while benefiting
   pollinators, could also hasten the extinction of native remnant plants
   in urban settings, or whether they could have other effects that enrich
   urban biodiversity. Goals of future wildflower mixes should consider the
   totality of potential interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator decline is of international concern because of the economic
   services these organisms provide. Commonly cited sources of decline are
   toxicants, habitat fragmentation, and parasites. Toxicant exposure can
   occur through uptake and distribution from plant tissues and resources
   such as pollen and nectar. Metals such as aluminum can be distributed to
   pollinators and other herbivores through this route especially in
   acidified or mined areas. A free-flying artificial flower patch
   apparatus was used to understand how two concentrations of aluminum (2
   mg/L and 20 mg/L) may affect the learning, orientation, and foraging
   behaviors of honey bees (Apis mellifera) in Turkey. The results show
   that a single dose of aluminum immediately affects the floral decision
   making of honey bees potentially by altering sucrose perception,
   increasing activity level, or reducing the likelihood of foraging on
   safer or uncontaminated resource patches. We conclude that aluminum
   exposure may be detrimental to foraging behaviors and potentially to
   other ecologically relevant behaviors.}},

Title = {{Pollinators Unknown: People's Perception of Native Bees in an Agrarian
   District of West Bengal, India, and Its Implication in Conservation}},
Journal = {{TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Native bees are important pollinators of cultivated and wild plants.
   Although much importance has been accorded them in many countries of the
   world, India has largely ignored the role of these important ecosystem
   service providers for too long. The consequence is public apathy toward
   these beneficial insects. This study has attempted to find out the
   general ``bee awareness'' of people living in agrarian societies in a
   socioeconomically underdeveloped Indian district through picture-based
   questionnaire surveys and has also attempted to determine the
   effectiveness of information divulgation in changing people's perception
   toward native bees. Opinion of the people on honeybee health in this
   district has also been explored. It has been found that traditional
   knowledge of bees is largely restricted to the honey-producing species
   of the genus Apis, and even though other native species are frequently
   encountered by the people, there is a substantial lack of awareness
   about their true nature and importance. However, the study suggests that
   through right training, this situation may favorably be altered.
   Multiple regression analysis of socioeconomic factors determining bee
   knowledge of respondents revealed that women were > 4 times better at
   identifying native bees than men, both with or without given
   information, and the higher the level of education the better people
   were at identifying native bees. People considered pesticides and their
   irregular application to be the major killers of honeybees. This study
   generates hope for involvement of local people in native as well as
   honeybee conservation and management through proper awareness campaigns
   and right education.}},

   temporal diversity in a Southern California native bee assemblage}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Despite a large number of ecological studies that document diversity
   loss resulting from anthropogenic disturbance, surprisingly few consider
   how disturbance affects temporal patterns of diversity that result from
   seasonal turnover of species. Temporal dynamics can play an important
   role in the structure and function of biological assemblages. Here, we
   investigate the temporal diversity patterns of bee faunas in Southern
   California coastal sage scrub ecosystems that have been extensively
   fragmented by urbanization. Using a two-year dataset of 235 bee species
   (n = 12,036 specimens), we compared 1-ha plots in scrub fragments and
   scrub reserves with respect to three components of temporal diversity:
   overall plot-level diversity pooled over time (temporal gamma
   diversity), diversity at discrete points in time (temporal alpha
   diversity), and seasonal turnover in assemblage composition (temporal
   beta diversity). Compared to reserves, fragments harbored bee
   assemblages with lower species richness and assemblage evenness both
   when summed across temporal samples (i.e., lower temporal gamma
   diversity) and at single points in time (i.e., lower temporal alpha
   diversity). Bee assemblages in fragments also exhibited reduced seasonal
   turnover (i.e., lower temporal beta diversity). While fragments and
   reserves did not differ in overall bee abundance, bee abundance in
   fragments peaked later in the season compared to that in reserves. Our
   results argue for an increased awareness of temporal diversity patterns,
   as information about the distinct components of temporal diversity is
   essential both for characterizing the assemblage dynamics of seasonal
   organisms and for identifying potential impacts of anthropogenic
   disturbance on ecosystem function through its effects on assemblage
   dynamics.}},

Title = {{An updated understanding of Texas bumble bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae)
   species presence and potential distributions in Texas, USA}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Texas is the second largest state in the United States of America, and
   the largest state in the contiguous USA at nearly 700,000 sq. km.
   Several Texas bumble bee species have shown evidence of declines in
   portions of their continental ranges, and conservation initiatives
   targeting these species will be most effective if species distributions
   are well established. To date, statewide bumble bee distributions for
   Texas have been inferred primarily from specirrien records housed in
   natural history collections. To improve upon these maps, land help
   inform conservation decisions, this research aimed to (1) update
   existing Texas bumble bee presence databases to include recent
   (2007-2016) data from citizen science repositories and targeted field
   studies, (2) triodel statewide species distributions of the most common
   bumble bee species in Texas using MaxEnt, and (3) identify conservation
   target areas for the state that are most likely to contain habitat
   suitable for multiple declining species. The resulting Texas bumble bee
   database is comprised of 3,580 records, to include previously compiled
   museum records dating from 1897, recent field survey data, and vetted
   records from citizen science repositories. These data yielded an updated
   state species list that includes 11 species, as well as species
   distribution models (SDMs) for the most common Texas bumble bee species,
   including two that have shown evidence of range-wide declines: B.
   fratemus (Smith, 1854) and B. pensylvanicus (DeGeer, 1773). Based on
   analyses of these models, we have identified conservation priority areas
   within the Texas Cross Timbers, Texas Blackland Prairies, and East
   Central Texas Plains ecoregions where suitable habitat for both B.
   fraternus and B. pensylvanicus are highly likely to co-occur.}},

   (Xiangyuan), is a traditional ornamental tree in China with a
   finger-like fruit that is seedless. Its fruit-setting mechanism has not
   been studied before. The emasculation of Foshou showed that fruits set
   and were in a good development condition consistent with the
   non-emasculated control, indicating that Foshou produces parthenocarpic
   fruit. Foshou pollen can normally germinate and elongate in vitro. The
   pollen tubes of Xiangyuan entered the ovary 3 days after pollination,
   while Foshou pollen only germinated in the finger portion of the pistil
   and did not stretch to the ovary after a week. Moreover, paraffin
   sections of Foshou pistils revealed that Foshou ovules were aborted or
   abnormal during flower development, presumably having lost the
   attraction of female gametes for fertilization. These observations
   indicate that Foshou shows obligate parthenocarpy. Real-time
   quantitative PCR showed the mRNA expression levels of auxin-related
   genes, IAA9, AUCSIA, and PIN4, were down-regulated after anthesis. The
   auxin response gene CmsIAA9 was significantly down-regulated at 3 days
   post-anthesis in the basal pistil compared with CmIAA9 in Xiangyuan.
   Furthermore, the fruit set rate was reduced if the apical pistil was
   treated with NPA (N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid; an auxin transport
   inhibitor). In summary, the low transcription of CmsIAA9 in the basal
   pistil is related to parthenocarpic fruiting in Foshou. This result
   highlights that auxin could be used in field fruit breeding to obtain a
   greater number of Foshou fruits.}},

Abstract = {{1 A total of 33 nests of Xylocopa augusti was studied during two
   consecutive seasons.
   2 Nesting behaviour and floral resources used by the large carpenter bee
   X. augusti Lepeletier de Saint Fargeau were studied during the brood
   production season in an urban area in Argentina.
   3 Biological information about nesting aspects inside and outside the
   nest was considered, paying particular attention to year-long activity,
   foraging flights throughout the day for nectar and pollen collection,
   nectar dehydration, oviposition, and pollen preference.
   4 In the study area, X. augusti shows an univoltine life cycle, with a
   peak of nesting between October and December, which coincides with the
   greatest blooming period of the surrounding flora.
   5 From 36 analyzed larval provision samples, 18 pollen types were
   identified, most of them belonging to ornamental trees or shrubs. Pollen
   from Eucalyptus-Myrceugenia glaucescens (Cambess.) D. Legrand and Kausel
   (Myrtaceae), Solanum sp.-Cyphomandra betacea (Cav.) Sendtn. (Solanaceae)
   and Erythrina crista-galli L. (Fabaceae) was dominant.
   6 The ability to obtain pollen from poricidal anthers such as those of
   Solanum indicate the potential of X. augusti to be an excellent managed
   pollinator and a good candidate for pollinating Solanaceae, such as
   Solanum lycopersicum `tomato' and Solanum melongena `eggplant', which
   are economically important crops in this region.}},

Title = {{Floristic response to urbanization: Filtering of the bioregional flora
   in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY:Globally, urban plant populations are becoming
   increasingly important, as these plants play a vital role in
   ameliorating effects of ecosystem disturbance and climate change. Urban
   environments act as filters to bioregional flora, presenting survival
   challenges to spontaneous plants. Yet, because of the paucity of
   inventory data on plants in landscapes both before and after
   urbanization, few studies have directly investigated this effect of
   urbanization.
   METHODS:We used historical, contemporary, and regional plant species
   inventories for Indianapolis, Indiana USA to evaluate how urbanization
   filters the bioregional flora based on species diversity, functional
   traits, and phylogenetic community structure.
   KEY RESULTS:Approximately 60\% of the current regional flora was
   represented in the Indianapolis flora, both historically and presently.
   Native species that survived over time were significantly different in
   growth form, life form, and dispersal and pollination modes than those
   that were extirpated. Phylogenetically, the historical flora represented
   a random sample of the regional flora, while the current urban flora
   represented a nonrandom sample. Both graminoid habit and abiotic
   pollination are significantly more phylogenetically conserved than
   expected.
   CONCLUSIONS:Our results likely reflect the shift from agricultural cover
   to built environment, coupled with the influence of human preference, in
   shaping the current urban flora of Indianapolis. Based on our analyses,
   the urban environment of Indianapolis does filter the bioregional
   species pool. To the extent that these filters are shared by other
   cities and operate similarly, we may see increasingly homogenized urban
   floras across regions, with concurrent loss of evolutionary information.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The restoration of degraded forests to enhance biodiversity, ecosystem
   services, as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation is now a
   major priority in cities around the world. This study evaluated the
   success of the Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation
   Project in Durban, South Africa, by assessing ecological attributes.
   Measures of plant richness, diversity, vegetation structure, invasive
   alien plants (IAPs) and ecological processes were contrasted across a
   chronosequence of habitats under restoration (0-year-old, 3-year-old and
   5-year-old) and compared with a reference forest habitat (remnant
   natural forest). Native tree species recruitment and vegetation
   structure increased with restoration age. Ecological processes,
   represented by the composition of pollination and seed dispersal traits
   in all of the habitats under restoration, were similar to the reference
   habitat. However, low tree density and an increase in IAP cover with an
   increase in restoration age were identified as threats to reforestation
   success. We recommend enrichment planting and an effective IAP
   management strategy to promote more rapid habitat restoration while
   reducing site maintenance costs. Enrichment planting should not only
   focus on increasing tree species density and richness, but also on the
   inclusion of species with missing pollination and seed dispersal
   categories.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Policies and research increasingly focus on the protection of ecosystem
   services (ESs) through priority-area conservation. Priority areas for
   ESs should be identified based on ES capacity and ES demand and account
   for the connections between areas of ES capacity and demand (flow)
   resulting in areas of unique demand-supply connections (flow zones). We
   tested ways to account for ES demand and flow zones to identify priority
   areas in the European Union. We mapped the capacity and demand of a
   global (carbon sequestration), a regional (flood regulation), and 3
   local ESs (air quality, pollination, and urban leisure). We used
   Zonation software to identify priority areas for ESs based on 6 tests:
   with and without accounting for ES demand and 4 tests that accounted for
   the effect of ES flow zone. There was only 37.1\% overlap between the
   25\% of priority areas that encompassed the most ESs with and without
   accounting for ES demand. The level of ESs maintained in the priority
   areas increased from 23.2\% to 57.9\% after accounting for ES demand,
   especially for ESs with a small flow zone. Accounting for flow zone had
   a small effect on the location of priority areas and level of ESs
   maintained but resulted in fewer flow zones without ES maintained
   relative to ignoring flow zones. Accounting for demand and flow zones
   enhanced representation and distribution of ESs with local to regional
   flow zones without large trade-offs relative to the global ES. We found
   that ignoring ES demand led to the identification of priority areas in
   remote regions where benefits from ES capacity to society were small.
   Incorporating ESs in conservation planning should therefore always
   account for ES demand to identify an effective priority network for ESs.}},

Abstract = {{Valuable habitats in various spatial configurations are essential for
   maintaining biodiversity across highly fragmented urban landscapes. In a
   large-scale study, we explored the value of human-made structures -
   river levees - as valuable habitats that support large populations of
   plants and butterflies and affects the spatial turnover of species
   within an urban landscape. The most significant environmental variables
   affecting plant and butterfly populations on levees were also examined.
   The richness of native plant species was about 25\% greater on levee
   transects than on control grassland transects. However, the richness and
   abundance of butterflies on levees were the same as on grassland sites.
   Among environmental factors, urban area cover negatively affected the
   richness of native plant species. Shrub cover decreases the richness and
   abundance of butterfly species. In addition, high mowing intensity had a
   negative influence on abundance. Community dissimilarity of plants on
   levees was affected by spatial variables. Our study is the first to
   highlight levees as significant habitats for plant and herbivorous
   insect persistence, and their potential function for plant dispersal.

Abstract = {{Citrullus lanatus (camel melon) is an important summer weed of
   Australian fallows, and can rapidly develop monocultural stands in sandy
   soils receiving adequate soil moisture. As a general review on the
   biology of C lanatus, this paper reviewed the current published
   literature (including our recent published studies) and also summarised
   extensive field and laboratory studies performed on its biology,
   phenology and management in the South-West Slopes of New South Wales.
   Recent population genetics studies conducted in Australia have shown
   that the species is monotypic, and was introduced as a single
   colonisation event in the mid 1800's. Our studies showed genetic
   diversity in C. lanatus to be nonexistent across Australia and invasive
   ranges and highest in the native range in Africa. Further genetic
   analyses have shown the species in Australia is identical to Citrullus
   lanatus var. citroides, the citron melon, native to Africa and now
   naturalised across Africa, Asia and North America, where it is a weedy
   nuisance or occasionally a food source for livestock and humans.
   Although limited genotypic diversity may facilitate potential biocontrol
   strategies for Citrullus lanatus in Australia, biocontrol may be
   difficult due to its close genetic similarity to commercial watermelon,
   a major horticultural crop in Australia and more globally. In Australia,
   field germination was observed to occur during a two to three-month
   period between late spring and summer, when warm soil temperatures
   occurred and field establishment was typically observed after
   significant rainfall events and was associated with soil moisture
   availability. Controlled environment seed dormancy findings indicated
   that dormancy was significantly reduced by storage at ambient laboratory
   temperatures over eighteen months. Seed dormancy was transient and
   appeared to be both physical and physiological in nature, and was
   dependent on the period of after ripening during the post-harvest
   period. Key reproductive attributes, including high seed production,
   self-compatibility and pollination facilitated by several non-specific
   pollinators have likely resulted in increased spread of this weed in
   Australia and more globally. Management of C lanatus is achieved using
   IWM strategies including pre and post-emergent applications of
   herbicides as well as limiting fruit production by cultural practices
   including mowing, grazing and cultivation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Sexually deceptive orchids lure their specific male pollinators using
   volatile semiochemicals that mimic female sex pheromones. To date, the
   semiochemicals known to be involved consist of blends of chemically and
   biosynthetically related compounds. In contrast, we report that
   (S)-beta-citronellol and 2-hydroxy-6-methylacetophenone, two
   biosynthetically distinct compounds, are the active semiochemicals in
   Caladenia plicata, which is pollinated by male Zeleboria sp. thynnine
   wasps. They are also sex pheromone components of the female Zeleboria. A
   1: 4 blend elicits a high rate of attempted copulation (similar to 70\%)
   in bioassays, equivalent to rates observed at orchid flowers. Whereas
   beta-citronellol is well known, 2-hydroxy-6-methylacetophenone appears
   to be previously unknown as a floral volatile. Production of the two
   compounds is restricted to glandular sepal tips; thus, differential
   expression analysis of contrasting floral tissue transcriptomes was
   employed to illuminate the biosynthesis. As expected, production of
   (S)-beta-citronellol commences with the terpene synthase GES1 catalyzing
   the irreversible conversion of geranyl diphosphate (GPP) to geraniol.
   Contrary to prediction, biosynthesis subsequently proceeds in three
   steps, commencing with the oxidation of geraniol to geranial by alcohol
   dehydrogenase ADH3, followed by the enantioselective reduction of a
   double bond in geranial by geranial reductase GER1 to give
   (S)-beta-citronellal. Finally, ADH3-catalyzed reduction of
   (S)-beta-citronellal results in (S)-beta-citronellol. In line with
   previous work on insects showing that 2-hydroxy-6-methylacetophenone is
   derived from a polyketide pathway, we report a differentially expressed
   polyketide synthase (PKS) gene candidate. Thus, in this unique example
   of sexual deception, pollination is achieved by co-opting and regulating
   two independent biosynthetic pathways of floral volatile compounds.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the influence of habitat on floral (flower and nectar
   characteristics, phenology) and pollination biology (flower visitors and
   breeding system) on Callistemon citrinus (syn. Callistemon lanceolatus),
   an Australian species of family Myrtaceae. In India, this small
   ornamental tree is cultivated in gardens, avenues and road sides and
   flowers throughout the year. At Agra (Uttar Pradesh, northern India)
   this species flowers twice a year (February-May and August-November).
   Flowers open early in the morning and can be characterized as
   protandrous for a brief period. Fresh open flowers presented ca. 25\% of
   total produced nectar. Nectar sugar composition consisted of only
   glucose and fructose. A wide array of visitors (honey bees (Apis
   dorsata), butterflies, wasps, ants, moth, hover flies, several birds and
   Indian palm squirrel) visit flowers either for pollen or nectar or for
   facilitating self- and cross-pollination by their intra-and inter-tree
   movements. Among these, honey bees are dominant in number and in the
   amount of pollen on their body, while butterflies, ants, wasps,
   sunbirds, parrots, oriental white-eye sparrow and squirrels forage only
   for nectar and can be considered occasional pollinators or nectar
   thieves. Although flowers are highly visited, nectar in standing crop
   showed that flower visitors did not consume the total nectar produced.
   Nectar replenishment decreased with age in both bagged- and exposed
   flowers, showing the capability of secreting nectar after removal during
   the entire flower lifetime. Experimental hand-pollinations showed that
   naturalized C. citrinus fruits matured through autogamy, geitonogamy or
   xenogamy as was reported for native Australian populations. C citrinus
   displays an interesting reproductive strategy, shows phenotypic
   plasticity of flowering periodicity and interacts with a generalized
   pollinator system, attracts a wide array of animal species with a
   conspicuous amount or replenished nectar after removals, and uses both
   compatibility strategies- xenogamy and autogamy- to ensure successful
   pollination and seed production at native or naturalized habitats. (C)

Title = {{Conservation relevance of bat caves for biodiversity and ecosystem

Abstract = {{All ecosystems are dotted by salient small natural features that not
   only characterize them but also significantly add to their biodiversity
   and functions. These small natural features are prominent but easily
   missed when ecosystems are described. Caves are one key example of this.
   Cave ecosystems are underrepresented in conservation planning and
   implementation around the world and have become mostly overlooked in
   conservation strategies overall. Caves contain high levels of
   biodiversity from fungi to invertebrates to vertebrates. This paper
   emphasizes bat caves as providers of ecosystem services to vast areas
   surrounding them, in the order of hundreds of thousands of square km
   just in North America. Their influence extends three-dimensionally via
   subterraneous water bodies and via the aerial nightly dispersal of the
   bats that provide a host of services from seed dispersal to pollination
   to pest control. The examples used focus primarily on free-tailed bats
   in North America, but the same principles apply to any other cave in the
   world with significant bat colonies. Caves enjoy protection, legal or
   actual, in some countries and not in others, and as a result many have
   suffered damage or been destroyed altogether. Common threats are
   vandalism, urbanization, and pollution. Many caves are attractive as
   ecotourism destinations and provide unique opportunities to educate the
   public about unexpected biodiversity values and ecosystem services.
   Inventorying caves poses challenges, but efforts are under way to assess
   caves in need of protection. Incipient cave protection strategies
   include legal and educational efforts, and management. Although
   illustrated with bat caves, given the importance of all caves and their
   precarious status, it is time to call the attention of decision makers
   about the urgent need to launch a worldwide cave conservation
   initiative. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Leafcutter bees collect leaf discs to encase brood cells. However, our
   understanding of their use of plants as nesting resources, which is
   critical for their conservation, is poor. We followed plants and
   observed bees cutting leaves to understand the leaf and plant traits of
   the leaf forage plants of Megachile spp. We studied whether the leaf
   size explains the cut size and the number of cuts in the leaves. The
   bees collected leaves from 59 species, 49 genera and 25 families of
   plants of various habits. Plant habit, leaf morphotype and leaf size did
   not influence leaf choice by the bees. Of the plants surveyed, 45.22\%
   had the distinguishable cutting marks. About 63\% and 98\% of the plants
   the bees used are native to the region and to the tropical southern
   hemisphere, respectively. Bees selected leaves over an extreme size
   range, and the leaf size predicted the number of cuts on a leaf.
   Comparing our results with other studies, we conclude that the
   leafcutter bees' selection of plants is adapted to the local

   proteins play important role in SI reactions. Rbx1 is component of
   Skp1-cull-F-box. However, studies did not reveal role of Rbx1 gene in SI
   reaction of citrus. In this study, Rbx1 gene was cloned. Three bases
   differed in amino acid content and open read frame sequence between
   Wuzishatangju (WZSTJ) and Shatangju (STJ). After self-pollination, Rbx1
   expression rapidly increased from 0 to 3 d h. Highest expression was
   detected in day 3 and then decreased within days 4-7. After
   cross-pollination, Rbx1 expression gene slowly increased from 0 to 4
   days and declined from days 5 to 7. Expression level of self-pollination
   was six-fold than that of cross-pollination.
   Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that Rbx1 has close genetic

Abstract = {{Human impacts are believed to be the main cause of the marked decline in
   bee populations around the world. The ongoing expansion of the urban
   landscape has created obstacles to the establishment of some bee
   species, including those that are important pollinators. However,
   Centris (Hemisiella) tarsata is frequently found in urban landscapes in
   South America and is considered a keystone species in pollination
   programmes. Despite the importance of this species, there are no
   previous studies on the genetic diversity and population structure of C.
   tarsata. In the present study, four mitochondrial genes (cytb, COI, 16S
   and 12S) were analysed in 189 individuals from 16 localities in Brazil.
   The analysis of the concatenated gene sequences (2058 bp) revealed high
   haplotype variability at each sampling site. Ninety-nine highly similar
   haplotypes were found and no differentiation among populations was
   detected. Two haplotypes were shared by most sites, whereas 77 were
   locally restricted. The star-like haplotype network and expansion tests
   indicate that C. tarsata populations underwent expansion during the late
   Pleistocene. The present results and the high potential of the species
   for dispersal lend support to this marked population expansion. Overall,
   the findings indicate that this solitary bee is potentially capable of
   maintaining high levels of genetic diversity in the urban landscape.}},

   (Aspargaceae)}},
Journal = {{BOTANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{409-422}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Reproductive traits are features of a species' biology that
   may determine its rarity, as they affect its genetic diversity and
   structure, as well as its population dynamics.
   Study species: The rare and threatened species Furcraea parmentieri,
   whose distribution is limited to the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt.
   Questions: How is the reproductive phenology of F. parmentieri? Does
   flower morphology vary between individuals? Does it produce nectar?
   Which animals visit its flowers? Is it self-compatible? Do the seeds
   originated via different pollination treatments show differences in
   their germinability?
   Study sites and dates: We studied the F. parmentieri from 2007 to 2008,
   at El Xitle volcano (altitude: 2,800-3,100 m; pine-oak forest), in the
   south of Mexico City.
   Methods: Reproductive phenology was recorded through fortnightly visits
   to the study site. Flowers were collected, flower visitors were recorded
   and nectar production was measured. An experiment was done which
   included four treatments: autonomous pollination, geitonogamy, cross
   pollination, and a control. We measured seed set, fruit set and seed
   germination in each treatment.
   Results: Inflorescences started in January and flowering finished in
   May. Fruit maturation took from May to November. Nectar production was
   negligible. Flowers were visited by hawkmoths and hummingbirds. Fruit
   set was very low (ca. 5 \%) and we observed self-incompatibility.
   Conclusions: Fucraeae parmentieri presents a low fruit set due to
   pollinator limitation. However the population seems to be thriving. The
   main threat faced by this species is the high land-use change rate along
   its distribution range, as well as climate change.}},

Title = {{Spatial and temporal variation in volatile composition suggests
   olfactory division of labor within the trap flowers of Aristolochia
   gigantea}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},

Abstract = {{The olfactory components of floral advertisement can be complex, often
   showing dynamic patterns of emission and chemical composition that may
   reflect diverse functions related to pollination. In this study we
   investigated the spatial and temporal variation of volatile production
   in the distinctive kettle trap flowers of the Neotropical pipevine
   Aristolochia gigantea (Aristolochiaceae). These flowers show unusual
   complexity in scent chemistry and floral morphology in addition to
   conspicuous changes in scent at distinct stages during floral ontogeny.
   In this study, volatiles were collected from separate stages in
   development (bud, female, male, wilted flower), and from different
   functional units (limb, black ring, yellow disk, utricle, nectary)
   within each stage. Our results document a strikingly complex and dynamic
   floral scent composition for A. gigantea. Female stage floral emissions
   are dominated by sweet lemon scented citronella-like compounds including
   (E)- and (Z)-citral, citronellol and citronellal, and at the same time
   include smaller amounts of pungent, brood-site associated volatiles such
   as dimethyl disulfide, 2-heptanone, and 3-methyl-1-butanol. Volatile
   emissions plummet one day later in male stage flowers, except for
   increased production of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, including a
   burst of linalool within the floral chamber. Volatiles emitted from
   wilted flowers resemble the vegetative background as soon as 48 h post
   anthesis. Multidimensional scaling revealed unexpected differentiation
   of volatile emissions across spatial units of the complex flower (e.g.
   within vs. outside of the trap), as well as at different stages of
   sexual expression as flowers matured. These results suggest that
   protogynous kettle trap flowers or inflorescences utilize a chemical
   division of labor, in concert with visual and tactile cues, to
   choreograph pollinator behavior such that female and male floral
   functions are optimized. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Concern over the declines of pollinator populations during the last
   decade has resulted in calls from governments and international agencies
   to better monitor these organisms. Recent studies of bee diversity in
   urban environments suggest that cities may contain significant amounts
   of bee species, even greater than surrounding agricultural areas, and in
   some occasions comparable to natural habitats. We conducted a three-year
   survey of bees in the city of St. Louis, MO. Like many other
   post-industrial cities in the United States, St. Louis is considered a
   shrinking city, with many vacant lots and unoccupied structures, mostly
   in the urban core. We sampled a broad range of habitats throughout the
   growing seasons of 2013 to 2016, e.g., vacant lots, city parks,
   community gardens, and urban farms, using aerial netting. This resulted
   in over 7,700 specimens. Data from other surveys, e.g., BioBlitz, and
   personal collections was also utilized in developing the species list.
   These data were supplemented with inspections of entomological
   collections from institutions in the state and the scientific
   literature. We identified a total of 198 species of bees from five
   different families that occur in the city. Only nine of the bee species
   present in the city are non-natives. The city of St. Louis currently
   hosts nearly 45\% of the bee diversity of the state, likely making it
   one of most species-rich cities relative to its state's total bee fauna
   in the country. This represents a great natural resource that must be
   better understood, and has potential conservation implications.}},

   E-avicula}},
Journal = {{PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Crane flies and microlepidoptera have been recorded as pollinators in
   unrelated orchid groups, but these insects have never been recorded in
   Epidendroideae, the most species-rich orchid subfamily, which includes
   one of the most diverse genera among Orchidaceae, Epidendrum. Based on
   data on phenology, floral morpho-anatomy, pollinators, pollination
   mechanisms and breeding system, the reproductive biology of E. avicula
   was studied in south-eastern Brazil. Epidendrum avicula possess
   osmophores that produce a citric fragrance at night. The flowers attract
   Tipulidae flies and several families of microlepidoptera that drink the
   nectar produced in a tube formed by the adnation of the labellum and
   column. As is common in Epidendrum, after removing the pollinarium, both
   crane flies and micro-moths get trapped by the proboscis, which
   frightens the insects and inhibits any possible intent to immediately
   visit another flower. The behavior of the pollinators on flowers, plus
   the retention of the anther cap by the pollinarium, results in a
   reduction in the occurrence of geitonogamy. Because E. avicula is
   self-incompatible, the consequence of pollinator behavior and the floral
   mechanisms tend to reduce the pollen loss. As far as we know, this is
   the first study to report the reproductive biology of a species of
   Epidendroideae pollinated by crane flies and microlepidoptera. Based on
   more recent concepts of plant-pollinator interactions, although E.
   avicula is pollinated by several species belonging to two distinct
   orders, suggesting an unspecialized pollination system is involved,
   nectar-seeking microlepidoptera and Tipulidae flies can be recognized as
   a single functional group.}},

Title = {{Physiological thermal limits predict differential responses of bees to
   urban heat-island effects}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Changes in community composition are an important, but hard to predict,
   effect of climate change. Here, we use a wild-bee study system to test
   the ability of critical thermal maxima (CTmax, a measure of heat
   tolerance) to predict community responses to urban heat-island effects
   in Raleigh, NC, USA. Among 15 focal species, CTmax ranged from 44.6 to
   51.3 degrees C, and was strongly predictive of population responses to
   urban warming across 18 study sites (r(2) = 0.44). Species with low
   CTmax declined the most. After phylogenetic correction, solitary species
   and cavity-nesting species (bumblebees) had the lowest CTmax, suggesting

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator interactions are potentially at risk due to climate
   change. Because of the spatial and temporal variation associated with
   the effects of climate change and the responses of both actors, research
   to assess this interaction requires creative approaches. This review
   focuses on assessments of plants' and pollinators' altered phenology in
   response to environmental changes, as phenology is one of the key
   responses. I reviewed research methods with the goal of presenting the
   wide diversity of available techniques for addressing changes in these
   interactions. Approaches ranged from use of historical specimens to
   multisite experimental community studies; while differing in depth of
   historical information and community interactions, all contribute to
   assessment of phenology changes. Particularly insightful were those
   studies that directly assessed the environmental changes across spatial
   and temporal scales and the responses of plants and pollinators at these
   scales. Longer-term studies across environmental gradients, potentially
   with reciprocal transplants, enable an assessment of climate impacts at
   both scales. While changes in phenology are well studied, the impacts of
   phenology changes are not. Future research should include approaches to
   address this gap.}},

   Luculia yunnanensis Hu is an endemic plant from Yunnan Province, China.
   Headspace-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) was used to identify the volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) of the different flower development stages of L.
   yunnanensis for the evaluation of floral volatile polymorphism. The
   results showed that a total of 40 compounds were identified at four
   different stages. The main aroma-active compounds were 3-carene,
   alpha-cubebene, alpha-copaene, delta-cadinene, and isoledene. Floral
   scent emission had the tendency to ascend first and descend in
   succession, reaching its peak level at the initial-flowering stage. The
   richest diversity of floral volatiles was detected at the full-flowering
   stage. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the composition
   and its relative content of floral scent differed at the whole flower
   development stage. In comparison with the other two species of Luculia
   (L. pinceana and L. gratissima), the composition and its relative
   content of floral scent were also different among the tree species.}},

Abstract = {{Postbloom fruit drop (PFD) is an important citrus disease that causes up
   to 100\% yield losses during years in which conditions are favourable
   for the occurrence of epidemics. The conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum
   and C. gloeosporioides, causal agents of PFD, are predominantly
   dispersed by rain splash. At the beginning of epidemics, the
   distribution of diseased plants is random and the disease progress rate
   is very high, which is unusual for pathogens spread by rain splash. As
   the pathogen produces abundant conidia on diseased petals, pollinating
   insects may contribute to disease dispersal. This study investigated
   honeybees (Apis mellifera) as dispersal agents of C. acutatum and C.
   gloeosporioides among citrus plants. Two experiments were carried out in
   a screenhouse in which citrus plants were protected (or not) in
   insect-proof cages. The source of inoculum was placed on one side of the
   screenhouse, and a honeybee hive was placed on the opposite side. All
   uncaged plants showed symptoms of the disease, and none of the caged
   plants exhibited PFD symptoms. The monomolecular model showed a good fit
   to disease progress in both experiments. Conidiumlike structures of
   Colletotrichum spp. were identified attached to the bodies of the
   honeybees by scanning electron microscopy. These results have revealed
   that honeybees disperse Colletotrichum among citrus plants.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator services and the development of beekeeping as a poverty
   alleviating tool have gained considerable focus in recent years in
   sub-Saharan Africa. An improved understanding of the pervasive
   environmental extent of agro-chemical contaminants is critical to the
   success of beekeeping development and the production of clean hive
   products. This study developed and validated a multi-residue method for
   screening 36 pesticides in honeybees, honey and beeswax using LC-MS/MS
   and GC-ECD. Of the 36 screened pesticides, 20 were detected. The highest
   frequencies occurred in beeswax and in samples from apiaries located in
   the proximity of citrus and tobacco farms. Fungicides were the most
   prevalent chemical class. Detected insecticides included neonicotinoids,
   organophosphates, carbamates, organophosphorus, tetrazines and
   diacylhydrazines. All detected pesticide levels were below maximum
   residue limits (according to EU regulations) and the lethal doses known
   for honeybees. However, future risk assessment is needed to determine
   the health effects on the African genotype of honeybees by these
   pesticide classes and combinations of these. In conclusion, our data
   present a significant challenge to the burgeoning organic honey sector
   in Uganda, but to achieve this, there is an urgent need to regulate the
   contact routes of pesticides into the beehive products. Interestingly,
   the ``zero{''} detection rate of pesticides in the Mid-Northern zone is
   a significant indicator of the large potential to promote Ugandan
   organic honey for the export market.}},

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal variation in the availability of food resources may be a
   determining factor for reproductive success and maintenance of bees, but
   the extent of these variations is poorly understood. For management and
   conservation of bees, the first step is to know the behavior and the
   food resources used. Currently, urban areas are considered refuge zones
   for bees, and understanding the availability of floral resources and the
   influence on reproductive processes is very important for management of
   bees. We used the protocols applied in phenological studies with bees
   and plant species to evaluate both throughout the year in an urbanized
   area. At the same time, we used palynology protocols to analyze the
   pollen material collected from brood cells (food and feces) of immature
   Centris analis. These protocols allowed to evaluate the availability of
   floral resources in the studied area and the plant species effectively
   used by C. analis females to feed immature larvae during the
   reproductive period. The maximum reproductive period of C. analis was
   not associated with the highest floral resources availability. However,
   there was a strong selectivity of pollen in flowers of Malpighia
   emarginata (Malpighiaceae), which represented more than 59\% of all the
   pollen grains provisioned throughout the year. This means that in the
   case of more specialized bees like C. analis, the availability of the
   preferred plants is more important than the overall floral resource
   availability in the area. Thus, to keep C. analis in the city, it is
   necessary to maintain or introduce Malpighiaceae species in the urban
   planning. On the other hand, at least 27\% of the plant species found in
   the study area are pollinated by C. analis, emphasizing the importance
   of preserving this bee.}},

Abstract = {{Information on the pollination ecology and floral visitors of the
   noxious weed Centaurea solstitialis is available for several populations
   in its invasive range, but limited information is available in its
   native range, with most studies conducted on the Greek island of Lesvos.
   Herein, we document the visitation pattern of bees and explore the
   relationship of bee body size and nectar availability in weedy
   populations of C. solstitialis from an urban environment within its
   native range in northwestern Turkey. Studies were conducted at patches
   of C. solstitialis in abandoned lots at the Uludag University near the
   city of Bursa. A total of 41 species, including honey bees, belonging to
   five families and 19 genera were recorded. Small megachilid and halictid
   bee species were the most common visitors. Average nectar standing crop
   volume per floret was low (0.003-0.117 mu L) and did not significantly
   vary throughout the day. Average bee head width significantly correlated
   with average nectar standing crop volume but did not significantly
   change throughout the day. Analyses of pollen loads as well as direct
   observations of bee foraging behavior indicate that a large number of
   bees visit C. solstitialis, primarily in search of nectar while carrying
   a large percentage of pollen grains of this plant species on their
   bodies. These results are similar to previous observations on a
   non-weedy population of C. solstitialis from the island of Lesvos.}},

Abstract = {{Sixteen honey bee ( Apis mellifera L.) colonies were placed in four
   different agricultural landscapes to study the effects of agricultural
   landscape and exposure to pesticides on honey bee health. Colonies were
   located in three different agricultural areas with varying levels of
   agricultural intensity (AG areas) and one nonagricultural area (NAG
   area). Colonies were monitored for their performance and productivity
   for one year by measuring colony weight changes, brood production, and
   colony thermoregulation. Palynological and chemical analyses were
   conducted on the trapped pollen collected from each colony and location.
   Our results indicate that the landscape's composition significantly
   affected honey bee colony performance and development. Colony weight and
   brood production were significantly greater in AG areas compared to the
   NAG area. Better colony thermoregulation in AG areas' colonies was also
   observed. The quantities of pesticides measured in the trapped pollen
   were relatively low compared to their acute toxicity. Unexplained queen
   and colony losses were recorded in the AG areas, while colony losses
   because of starvation were observed in the NAG area. Our results
   indicate that landscape with high urban activity enhances honey bee
   brood production, with no significant effects on colony weight gain. Our
   study indicates that agricultural crops provide a valuable resource for
   honey bee colonies, but there is a trade-off with an increased risk of
   exposure to pesticides.}},

Abstract = {{Although urban agriculture is growing in popularity, little is known
   about the distribution of insect pollinators across urbanized
   landscapes. We used the pollination module of InVEST (a suite of
   software models used to map and value ecosystem services), along with
   fine-scale land cover data and empirical data on bee distributions, to
   assess different scenarios of urban pollinator management in Chicago,
   Illinois (USA). Specifically, we simulated the partial conversion of
   lawn/turf-grass to floral resources in city parks only, in gardens
   managed by individual households only, and in any available turf grass
   within buffer distances of 250-1000 m of urban farms, community gardens,
   and home gardens across Chicago. We found that the output of InVEST's
   pollination model was significantly related to empirical measures of bee
   richness (explaining 46\% of the variation) but not bee abundance in
   Chicago. To increase pollination supply at urban farms and community
   gardens, our results indicate that, out of the scenarios presented here,
   the best strategy for the City of Chicago would be to concentrate floral
   resources nearby (within a 250 m buffer rather than within a 1 km
   buffer). In contrast, for home gardens, the model indicates that it may
   be better to increase floral resources throughout the city. This
   discrepancy may be due to the smaller size of home gardens and their
   more dispersed spatial arrangement throughout the city. Generally, our
   results indicate that converting turf grass to a more florally-rich land
   cover would support increased supply of pollinators and urban
   agriculture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to deforestation and fragmentation of ecosystems, the management of

   Because urban environments are stressful, the dietary knowledge in such
   areas can help to cope with this issue in the near future. Using
   palynological analysis the floral resources used by Centris flavifrons,
   an important pollinator of crops and native plants was studied in an
   urban area. Byrsonima sericea type, Solanum paniculatum type, Cestrum
   type, and Myrcia type 1 together accounted for more than 93\% of pollen
   grains foraged by females. It is noteworthy that this bee population
   depends on few plant species both for pollen and for oil. Furthermore,
   females showed flexibility to replace the primary pollen source in
   different breeding seasons, as well as one female could provision
   different cells in the same nest with different predominant pollen
   types. The importance of wastelands and natural areasis highlighted for
   keeping bee populations in urban areas.}},

   new hybrid approach}},
Journal = {{SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{75-88}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, nonlinear time series analysis and short-term prediction
   of solar irradiation were considered, simultaneously. The proposed
   methodology is to employ time series analysis methods as well as swarm
   and evolutionary algorithms in conjunction with well-known regression,
   fuzzy and neural network model structures to develop a simple but
   efficient and applicable model for solar irradiation forecasting. The
   employed experimental data was the hourly solar irradiation of Qazvin
   city in Iran for five years. At first, the solar irradiation data was
   normalized using the daily clear sky irradiation data which is an
   annually periodic time series. Then, the properties of normalized solar
   irradiation were characterized via time series analysis methods such as
   recurrence plots, autocorrelation and mutual information analysis. Based
   on these analyses, each year was divided into two seasons, the sunny and
   cloudy seasons which are noticeably different in dynamics. Next, a
   hybrid but simple model was developed to predict the solar irradiation
   in different seasons. For the sunny season, an optimized multivariate
   regression model was proposed; and for the cloudy season a bi-level
   model consisting of an optimized regression model and ANFIS was
   developed. The model parameters were tuned optimally by various
   evolutionary algorithms being GA, PSO, ABC, COA, and flower pollination
   algorithm (FPA). A Fourier-type model was also developed for modeling of
   the clear sky data. The results showed the out performance of FPA method
   in tuning of the model parameters and convergence time. Besides, the
   performance of the proposed bi-level model was evaluated in comparison
   with some other model structures such as artificial neural networks,
   ANFIS networks, LSE-regression models, LS-support vector machines model,
   etc. The results showed that the proposed method performs considerably
   better than the other methods in forecasting the solar irradiation time
   series in both sunny and cloudy seasons.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen allergy is among the most widespread allergic disease in
   Andalusia. However, few studies have examined patient information in
   conjunction with data on airborne pollen concentrations. This paper
   sought to identify the airborne pollen types prevalent in Crdoba, to
   examine the relationship between airborne pollen and the occurrence of
   allergies, and to investigate the use of drugs to treat various symptoms
   displayed by pollen-allergy sufferers over the study period. A
   prospective longitudinal study was conducted in Crdoba City between
   February and June in 2014 and 2015, using an original specific
   questionnaire to collect socio-demographic, symptom and pollen-allergy
   data. Airborne pollen was collected using a Hirst-type volumetric spore
   trap. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was applied. A
   total of 178 sensitive subjects were included in the study. The
   prevalence of allergy to olive, grass and plane-tree pollen was 70.73,
   73.17 and 19.51\%, respectively, in 2014, and 70.83, 70.83 and 21.12\%,
   respectively, in 2015. In both years, rhinitis was the most common
   allergic symptom (93.90\% in 2014, 87.75\% in 2015) and a significant
   correlation between the occurrence of rhinitis and antihistamine
   consumption was found (p < 0.05 in 2014, p < 0.001 in 2015). The
   percentage of asthmatic subjects using an inhaler was significantly
   higher than those who did not used it (63.16\% vs. 26.98\%; p < 0.01).
   In conclusion, this paper supports previous studies showing that the
   most allergenic pollen types in spring were olive, grass and plane-tree
   pollen. In addition, we found that rhinitis was the main symptom and
   antihistamines the medication most widely used by the sensitized
   population in Cordoba.}},

Abstract = {{Orchid bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Euglossini) are important pollinators
   of many plant families in Neotropical forests, habitats that have become
   increasingly degraded and fragmented by agricultural practices. To
   understand the extent to which loss of natural habitat and isolation has
   affected the genetic diversity and diploid male production (DMP) of two
   orchid bee species, Euglossa dilemma and Euglossa viridissima, we
   collected and genotyped 1686 males at five microsatellite loci and
   tested for differences in allelic richness, heterozygosity and DMP
   across three different types of land use (natural, agricultural and
   urban) and between mainland and island populations in the Yucatan
   Peninsula of Mexico. We also investigated the impact of land use and
   geographic isolation on gene flow. Euglossa dilemma and E. viridissima
   seemed to be particularly resilient to loss of natural habitat; in
   locations with human impact, we did not find reduced genetic diversity,
   and populations generally showed very little population genetic
   structure. Only on islands did E. dilemma show significantly reduced
   genetic diversity. Even after accounting for putative null alleles, DMP
   was very low (0.2-1.3\%) across all sampling sites, including on
   islands. We therefore suggest that DMP is an insensitive measure of
   inbreeding and population decline in our two study species.}},

Abstract = {{We document a novel exotic bee for North America, Hylaeus (Hylaeus)
   communis Nylander, 1852 (Hymenoptera: Colletidae), and determine whether
   it is likely to spread widely across the continent. To evaluate the
   extent to which H. communis behaves as a generalist and would be able to
   adapt to novel North American environments, we compare the breadth of
   its climatic, floral, habitat, and nesting preferences between its
   native European range and sites where it was first discovered in
   southern Quebec, Canada. Specifically, we calculate the paired
   difference index, which approximates species generalism, from a set of
   bipartite networks linking Hylaeus Fabricius, 1793 species to their
   respective floral hosts and habitats. Results indicate that H. communis
   is the most adaptable bee of the European Hylaeus fauna and will likely
   acclimate to its new environment, being a greater generalist than an
   already widely established exotic bee, H. hyalinatus Smith, 1842. In
   southern Quebec, we find that, despite visiting a wide variety of
   flowering species, it exhibits a strong association with non-native
   plants and resides almost exclusively in urban settings. We hypothesise
   that H. communis will be able to spread widely throughout North America
   via multiple human-mediated but accidental dispersal events and by
   following the distribution of European weeds and horticultural plants.}},

Abstract = {{Pastaza is the largest and least populated province in Ecuador, with
   seven native indigenous nationalities. The Kichwas from the Rio Chico
   community live near to the capital city Puyo, are recognized for their
   knowledge on stingless honey bees. From the 400 species of Neotropical
   Meliponini that make honey in cerumen pots, almost 100 thrive in
   Southern Ecuador, and confer such biodiversity to pot-honey. In this
   study sensory characteristics of Ecuadorian false and genuine honeys
   with diverse entomological origin: Apis mellifera light amber and amber,
   Geotrigona leucogastra, Melipona grandis and Scaptotrigona sp. (S. ederi
   np Schwarz) were investigated with Kichwa assessors (four female and
   four male, aged 1862 years old). The panel was asked to taste and to
   identify sensory attributes of honey (appearance, taste, smell, aroma,
   mouthfeel, other tactile sensations), and to score their intensities in
   10 cm unstructured line scales anchored with the words weak and strong,
   using the Free-Choice Profile methodology The Generalized Procrustes
   Analysis was used on the data. The first and second dimensions accounted
   for by 61.1\% of the variance. In the descriptive sensory evaluation,
   darker honeys (amber A. mellifera, false and Geotrigona) were separated
   from (light amber A. mellifera, Melipona and Scaptotrigona) by the first
   dimension; whereas thicker honeys (A. mellifera and false) were
   discriminated from thinner honeys (Geotrigona, Melipona and
   Scaptotrigona) by the second dimension. The assessors were able to
   evaluate and differentiate honey types without previous sensory
   training. Remarkably, two Kichwa ladies immediately spit out the false
   honey, in contrast to an acceptance study on 18-honeys, where the false
   honey was scored among the preferred ones by 58 participants of the
   First Congress on Apiculture and Meliponiculture in Ecuador. Therefore,
   results suggest that Ecuadorian native Kichwas keep a sensory legacy of
   ancestral knowledge with forest products such as honey. (C) 2017

Title = {{Big city Bombus: using natural history and land-use history to find
   significant environmental drivers in bumble-bee declines in urban
   development}},
Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Native bee populations are critical sources of pollination.
   Unfortunately, native bees are declining in abundance and diversity.
   Much of this decline comes from human landuse change. While the effects
   of large-scale agriculture on native bees are relatively well
   understood, the effects of urban development are less clear.
   Understanding urbanity's effect on native bees requires consideration of
   specific characteristics of both particular bee species and their urban
   landscape. We surveyed bumble-bee (Bombus spp.) abundance and diversity
   in gardens across multiple urban centres in southeastern Michigan. There
   are significant declines in Bombus abundance and diversity associated
   with urban development when measured on scales in-line with Bombus
   flight ability. These declines are entirely driven by declines in
   females; males showed no response to urbanization. We hypothesize that
   this is owing to differing foraging strategies between the sexes, and it
   suggests reduced Bombus colony density in more urban areas. While
   urbanity reduced Bombus prevalence, results in Detroit imply that
   `shrinking cities' potentially offer unique urban paradigms that must be
   considered when studying wild bee ecology. Results show previously
   unidentified differences in the effects of urbanity on female and male
   bumble-bee populations and suggest that urban landscapes can be managed
   to support native bee conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Seedlessness is an excellent economical trait, and self-incompatibility
   (SI) is one of important factors resulting in seedless fruit in Citrus.
   However, SI molecular mechanism in Citrus is still unclear. In this
   study, RNA-Seq technology was used to identify differentially expressed
   genes related to SI reaction of'Wuzishatangju' (Citrus reticulata
   Blanco). A total of 35.67 GB raw RNA-Seq data was generated and was de
   novo assembled into 50,364 unigenes with an average length of 897 bp and
   N50 value of 1549. Twenty-three candidate unigenes related to SI were
   analyzed using qPCR at different tissues and stages after self- and
   cross-pollination. Seven pollen S genes (Unigene0050323, Unigene0001060,
   Unigene0004230, Unigene0004222, Unigene0012037, Unigene0048889 and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{191}},
Pages = {{162-171}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Urban road verges can contain significant biodiversity, contribute to
   structural connectivity between other urban greenspaces, and due to
   their proximity to road traffic are well placed to provide ecosystem
   services. Using the UK as a case study we review and critically evaluate
   a broad range of evidence to assess how this considerable potential can
   be enhanced despite financial, contractual and public opinion
   constraints. Reduced mowing frequency and other alterations would
   enhance biodiversity, aesthetics and pollination services, whilst
   delivering costs savings and potentially being publically acceptable.
   Retaining mature trees and planting additional ones is favourable to
   residents and would enhance biodiversity, pollution and climate
   regulation, carbon storage, and stormwater management. Optimising these
   services requires improved selection of tree species, and creating a
   more diverse tree stock. Due to establishment costs additional tree
   planting and maintenance could benefit from payment for ecosystem
   service schemes. Verges could also provide areas for cultivation of
   biofuels and possibly food production. Maximising the contribution of
   verges to urban biodiversity and ecosystem services is economical and
   becoming an increasingly urgent priority as the road network expands and
   other urban greenspace is lost, requiring enhancement of existing
   greenspace to facilitate sustainable urban development. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{Several biotic and abiotic factors may cause losses during the
   production of watermelon, Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. \& Nakai,
   but there are currently few tools available to quantify losses in the
   different components of crop production. A crop life table can be used
   to understand the factors that regulate losses during crop production to
   establish a sustainable crop management programme. The aim of this study
   was to identify the critical components and quantify the key factors
   affecting yield loss during watermelon production using a crop life
   table as a tool. In 2011 and 2012, watermelon production loss factors in
   the field were evaluated using a completely randomised experimental
   design with 12 replicates, and each replicate consisted of a 64-m(2)
   area containing 4 rows with 4 holes per row. The spacing was 2 x 2 m,
   and each hole initially contained 2 watermelon plants. The loss factors
   of physiological disturbance and insect, fungal, and bacterial attack
   were identified and quantified to develop a crop life table, and the
   primary factors regulating total watermelon yield losses were found to
   be flower abortion, abnormal fruits, and plant death caused by the
   fungus Didymella bryoniae. Watermelon yield losses are highest during
   rainy and humid seasons, and the results of this study show that pests
   and plant physiological disturbance should be jointly managed to attain
   higher watermelon crop yields. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{The role of Tre6P and SnRK1 in maize early kernel development and events
   leading to stress-induced kernel abortion}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{APR 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Drought stress during flowering is a major contributor to
   yield loss in maize. Genetic and biotechnological improvement in yield
   sustainability requires an understanding of the mechanisms underpinning
   yield loss. Sucrose starvation has been proposed as the cause for kernel
   abortion; however, potential targets for genetic improvement have not
   been identified. Field and greenhouse drought studies with maize are
   expensive and it can be difficult to reproduce results; therefore, an in
   vitro kernel culture method is presented as a proxy for drought stress
   occurring at the time of flowering in maize (3 days after pollination).
   This method is used to focus on the effects of drought on kernel
   metabolism, and the role of trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P) and the
   sucrose non-fermenting-1-related kinase (SnRK1) as potential regulators
   of this response.
   Results: A precipitous drop in Tre6P is observed during the first two
   hours after removing the kernels from the plant, and the resulting
   changes in transcript abundance are indicative of an activation of
   SnRK1, and an immediate shift from anabolism to catabolism. Once Tre6P
   levels are depleted to below 1 nmol.g(-1) FW in the kernel, SnRK1
   remained active throughout the 96 h experiment, regardless of the
   presence or absence of sucrose in the medium. Recovery on sucrose
   enriched medium results in the restoration of sucrose synthesis and
   glycolysis. Biosynthetic processes including the citric acid cycle and
   protein and starch synthesis are inhibited by excision, and do not
   recover even after the re-addition of sucrose. It is also observed that
   excision induces the transcription of the sugar transporters SUT1 and
   SWEET1, the sucrose hydrolyzing enzymes CELL WALL INVERTASE 2 (INCW2)
   and SUCROSE SYNTHASE 1 (SUSY1), the class II TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE
   SYNTHASES (TPS), TREHALASE (TRE), and TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE
   (ZmTPPA. 3), previously shown to enhance drought tolerance (Nuccio et
   al., Nat Biotechnol (October 2014): 1-13, 2015).
   Conclusions: The impact of kernel excision from the ear triggers a
   cascade of events starting with the precipitous drop in Tre6P levels. It
   is proposed that the removal of Tre6P suppression of SnRK1 activity
   results in transcription of putative SnRK1 target genes, and the
   metabolic transition from biosynthesis to catabolism. This highlights
   the importance of Tre6P in the metabolic response to starvation. We also
   present evidence that sugars can mediate the activation of SnRK1. The
   precipitous drop in Tre6P corresponds to a large increase in
   transcription of ZmTPPA. 3, indicating that this specific enzyme may be
   responsible for the de-phosphorylation of Tre6P. The high levels of
   Tre6P in the immature embryo are likely important for preventing kernel
   abortion.}},

Abstract = {{Squashes and pumpkins are known and grown worldwide, including the
   Tetsukabuto type, a hybrid of Japanese origin. On this work, we
   evaluated yield and quality of parthenocarpic fruits of hybrid
   Tetsukabuto developed with the use of 2,4-D doses, in the climatic
   conditions of the Brazilian semiarid, in the city of Pombal, state of
   Paraiba, Brazil. The experiment was carried out from February to May
   2013, in complete blocks at random and five replications. Treatments
   corresponded to five 2,4-D doses (0, 90, 180, 270, and 360 mg/L) applied
   to female flowers, and a control treatment, where fruits developed out
   of insect pollinated flowers. We evaluated number of flowers per plant,
   duration of flowering, number of fruits per plant (used to estimate
   number of fruits per hectare), fruit set index, fruit mass and
   transversal and longitudinal diameters, pulp thickness and content of
   soluble solids, total fruit production and yield. Number of fruits per
   plant and fruit mass increased 269.5 and 15.4\%, respectively, with
   212.1 mg/L and 360.0 mg/L of 2,4-D, when compared to the control
   treatment. Increasing the 2,4-D dose from 0.0 to 241.4 mg/L resulted in
   38.2\% rise in plant production. Correlations were significant only for
   number of flowers x number of fruits per plant (NF) and NF x yield, with
   coefficients of 87.5 and 82.7\%, respectively. These results indicate
   that fruit induction using 2,4-D resulted in higher fruit set,
   independent of the 2,4-D dose applied.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is indispensable for the reproduction of native and

   evaluate the local environmental knowledge of students in elementary
   schools in rural areas about bees and pollination at two moments, before
   and after the use of specific educational activities. Initially 110
   students were interviewed and they mentioned a relatively low number of
   ethnospecies. After the educational activities, we noticed a marked
   increase in this number, besides the significant learning of important
   concepts. Rural school communities lack information about pollination
   and insect pollinators and the insects, pollinators or not, still
   constitute animals of negative reputation for people. We believe that a
   deeper knowledge of pollination and pollinators may improve sustainable

Abstract = {{A national-scale study of outcrossing potential within Chilean vascular
   flora was conducted using an upgraded algorithm, which adds parameters
   such as pollinator agents, climate, and geographic conditions. Datasets
   were organized and linked in a Web platform (), in which the development
   of a total outcrossing potential (TOP) predictor was formulated. The TOP
   predictor is the engine in the Web platform, which models the effect of
   a type of agricultural practice on others (coexistence calculation mode)
   and on the environment (biodiversity calculation mode). The scale for
   TOP results uses quintiles in order to define outcrossing potential
   between species as very low, low, medium, high, or very high. In a
   coexistence analysis considering 256 species (207 genera), the 10
   highest TOP values were for genera Citrus, Prunus, Trifolium, Brassica,
   Allium, Eucalyptus, Cucurbita, Solanum, Lollium, and Lotus. The highest
   TOP for species in this analysis fell at high potential, 4.9\% of the
   determined values. In biodiversity mode, seven out of 256 cultivated
   species (2.7\%) were native, and 249 (97.3\%) corresponded to introduced
   species. The highest TOP was obtained in the genera Senecio,
   Calceolaria, Viola, Solanum, Poa, Alstroemeria, Valeriana, Vicia,
   Atriplex, and Campanula, showing high potential in 4.9\% of the values.
   On the other hand, 137 genetically modified species, including the
   commercial and pre-commercial developments, were included and
   represented 100 genera. Among these, 22 genera had relatives (i.e.,
   members of the same genus) in the native/introduced group. The genera
   with the highest number of native/introduced relatives ranged from one
   (Ipomea, Limonium, Carica, Potentilla, Lotus, Castanea, and Daucus) to
   66 species (Solanum). The highest TOP was obtained when the same species
   were coincident in both groups, such as for Carica chilensis, Prosopis
   tamarugo, and Solanum tuberosum. Results are discussed from the
   perspective of assessing the possible impact of cultivated species on
   Chilean flora biodiversity. The TOP predictor () is useful in the
   context of environmental risk assessment.}},

   most influential factors for each horizon, making no assumptions about
   the significance of the weather features. The performace of the proposed

Abstract = {{In flowering plants, shifts from outcrossing to partial or complete
   self-fertilization have occurred independently thousands of times, yet
   the underlying adaptive processes are difficult to discern. Selfing's
   ability to provide reproductive assurance when pollination is uncertain
   is an oft-cited ecological explanation for its evolution, but this
   benefit may be outweighed by costs diminishing its selective advantage
   over outcrossing. We directly studied the fitness effects of a
   self-compatibility mutation that was backcrossed into a
   self-incompatible (SI) population of Leavenworthia alabamica,
   illuminating the direction and magnitude of selection on the
   mating-system modifier. In array experiments conducted in two years,
   self-compatible (SC) plants produced 17-26\% more seed, but this
   advantage was counteracted by extensive seed discountingthe replacement
   of high-quality outcrossed seeds by selfed seeds. Using a simple model
   and simulations, we demonstrate that SC mutations with these attributes
   rarely spread to high frequency in natural populations, unless
   inbreeding depression falls below a threshold value (0.57 (threshold)

Title = {{The structure of flower visitor networks in relation to pollination

Abstract = {{1. Pollination is a major ecosystem service in which insects,
   particularly bees, play an important role for the reproduction of most
   angiosperms. Currently, this service is considered under threat due to
   reported bee declines. Moderately urbanised areas could be important for
   pollinators and pollination; however, compared to agricultural and
   natural systems, they are poorly studied. 2. Here, we investigated the
   relative effects of local habitat quality and anthropogenic land use
   across an agricultural to urban gradient for local plant and flying
   insect communities. We quantified local flower visitor networks and
   related network architecture to these local and landscape factors using
   structural equationmodelling. Flower visitor network architecture is
   often assumed to act as a surrogate for the ecosystem service of
   pollination. To test this idea, we related network metrics to
   pollination of four experimental, insect pollinator-dependent plant
   species. 3. Overall, local land use markedly influenced plant and flying
   insect communities. Flower richness and bee richness were higher in
   urban compared to agricultural areas. Flower visitor network metrics
   (e.g. linkage density) increased with the proportion of urban area
   surrounding a site. Also, relative to agricultural areas, urban flower
   visitors were more generalised and foraged from a higher number of plant
   species, likely a consequence of higher urban flowering plant richness.
   However, urban bees also visited a lower proportion of the available
   flowering plants (higher specialisation). Surprisingly, linkage density,
   network specialisation and flower visitor generality were not related to
   pollination of our four experimental plants per se. Rather, it was the
   proportion of urban cover, flying insect abundance and bee richness that
   were positively related to pollination. 4. Our findings show strong
   effects of local land use on plant and flying insect communities and
   flower visitor interaction networks. We observed increased overall
   visitation rates and pollination services to our experimental plants in
   urban compared to agricultural areas, despite increased urban flower
   visitor generality. Indeed, flower visitor network metrics were a poor
   proxy of provision of the ecosystem service of pollination.
   Nevertheless, our results point to potential facilitating effects of
   diverse urban floral and bee communities for pollination.}},

Abstract = {{The benefits of citizen science to conservation, science, and
   socio-ecological systems as well as to participants themselves are
   increasingly recognized and valued, yet what motivates volunteers
   remains little studied and poorly understood. To better understand
   citizen scientists' motivations and how they benefit from their
   participation, we surveyed volunteers in the Great Pollinator Project, a
   conservation-related project in New York City. We conducted pre- and
   post-season surveys and focus group sessions to find out who the active
   volunteers were, their reasons for joining, what benefits of
   participation they experienced, as well as challenges they encountered
   collecting and submitting data. In comparison with results of several
   surveys of environmental and conservation volunteers, we found a similar
   range of motivators. However, while studies of motivations of
   environmental volunteers have indicated helping the environment as the
   strongest factor, interest in learning about bees the subject of the
   study was the top motivation of our citizen science volunteers. Helping
   or contributing to science was the second most cited motivator for
   participants in the project. Less strong were outdoor/recreation and
   social factors. We discuss some of the steps we took in response to
   participants' feedback in order to improve volunteer recruitment and
   retention. We also make additional recommendations for project design
   and research to enhance understanding of volunteer motivations, which
   will benefit volunteers themselves as well as strengthen their
   contribution to conservation outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Allotment gardens are a key feature of the urban landscape, providing
   numerous benefits beyond those of food production. These include
   ecosystem services such as local climate modification, pollination, and
   providing a pleasant location for socialising. The biodiversity of flora
   underpins many of these ecosystem services. The aims of this study are
   to assess the spontaneous vascular flora of urban allotment gardens and
   derive estimates of the species richness and diversity. In doing so, the
   specific position of allotment gardens within urban green infrastructure
   will be revealed and the role of allotment users in shaping local
   biodiversity determined. 358 species of spontaneous flora were recorded
   in 11 representative allotment garden estates (total area 150 ha) in
   PoznaA{''}, Poland. Fourteen biodiversity features were taken into
   account. The investigated areas exhibited high plant species richness,
   high diversity, low synanthropisation level, and contained valuable
   geobotanical elements, including plants of key importance for the
   European Community. For these reasons, allotment gardens should be
   considered as biodiversity hotspots for native species within urban
   green infrastructure. Based on an analysis of the spatial and functional
   organization of 110 individual plots, four types of usage, and
   corresponding plant diversity have been distinguished. The composition
   of the flora depends mostly on spatial and functional organization of
   allotment gardens and, to a much lesser extent, on the habitat
   conditions, which on individual plots varied very little. The high
   species richness and diversity in allotment gardens has important
   consequences for urban planning.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in the value of domestic gardens for
   supporting biodiversity. While it is well established that bumblebees
   exploit urban green spaces, this is the first study to explore the land
   use and floral preferences of the UK's seven most common bumblebees in
   gardens and allotments cultivated for food. A citizen science survey was
   carried out at 38 sites, between 1st June and 30th September 2013. At
   the landscape scale, bumblebee abundance and species richness was not
   significantly correlated with surrounding land use characteristics (both
   p > 0.05). Bombus pratorum was the only species to show correlations
   with surrounding land use, demonstrating a positive relationship with
   built areas and gardens and allotments, and a negative correlation with
   greenspace and agriculture. At the local site-level scale, bumblebee
   abundance was negatively correlated with areas cultivated for vegetables
   and fruits, and positively correlated with areas cultivated for flowers,
   although neither correlation was statistically significant (p = 0.070
   and p = 0.051 respectively). Bumblebee species richness was not
   correlated with either land use (p > 0.05). All bumblebee species were
   negatively correlated with areas cultivated for vegetables and fruit,
   bare ground and hard paving. Several flowering plants were visited by
   all bumblebee species, although relative preferences varied between
   bumblebee species. Results emphasise the importance of including floral
   resources within garden and allotment areas cultivated for food, and the
   need for a mosaic of different flowering plants to cater for varying
   floral preferences demonstrated by bumblebee species.}},

Abstract = {{With their abundant floral resources, urban community gardens have the
   potential to play an important role in pollinator conservation. At the
   same time, the gardens themselves are dependent upon the pollination
   services provided by insects. Thus, understanding the variables that can
   increase bee richness or abundance in community gardens can contribute
   to both urban agriculture and pollinator conservation. Here we examine
   the impact of several environmental variables on bee abundance and
   diversity in urban community gardens in Sydney, Australia. We used hand
   netting and trap nests to sample bees in 27 community gardens ranging
   from inner city gardens with limited surrounding green space, to
   suburban gardens located next to national parks. We did not find strong
   support for an impact of any of our variables on bee species richness,
   abundance or diversity. We found high abundance of a recently introduced
   non-native bee: the African carder bee, Afranthidium repetitum (Schulz
   1906). The abundance of African carder bees was negatively correlated
   with the amount of surrounding green space and positively correlated
   with native bee abundance/species richness. Our results highlight the
   seemingly rapid increase in African carder bee populations in inner city
   Sydney, and we call for more research into this bee's potential
   environmental impacts. Our results also suggest that hard-to-change
   environmental factors such as garden size and distance to remnant
   forests may not have a strong influence on native bee diversity and
   abundance in highly urbanized area.}},

Title = {{Specialist nectar-yeasts decline with urbanization in Berlin}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Nectar yeasts are common inhabitants of insect-pollinated flowers but
   factors determining their distribution are not well understood. We
   studied the influence of host identity, environmental factors related to
   pollution/urbanization, and the distance to a target beehive on local
   distribution of nectar yeasts within Robinia pseudoacacia L. and Tilia
   tomentosa Moench in Berlin, Germany. Nectar samples of six individuals
   per species were collected at seven sites in a 2 km radius from each
   target beehive and plated on YM-Agar to visualise the different
   morphotypes, which were then identified by sequencing a section of the
   26S rDNA gene. Multivariate linear models were used to analyze the
   effects of all investigated factors on yeast occurrence per tree. Yeast
   distribution was mainly driven by host identity. The influence of the
   environmental factors (NO2, height of construction, soil sealing)
   strongly depended on the radius around the tree, similar to the distance
   of the sampled beehive. Incidence of specialist nectar-borne yeast
   species decreased with increasing pollution/urbanization index. Given
   that specialist yeast species gave way to generalist yeasts that have a
   reduced dependency on pollinators for between-flower dispersal, our
   results indicate that increased urbanization may restrict the movement
   of nectar-specialized yeasts, via limitations of pollinator foraging
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Gamma radiation has been widely applied in citrus breeding to create
   seedless cultivar. However, little is yet known regarding the effect of
   gamma-radiation mutagenesis on seed development in genus Citrus. In this
   report, a seedless mutant created from polyembryonic `Meiguicheng'
   orange (Citrus sinensis) with gamma-rays and its wild type were used to
   investigate the relationship between gamma-radiation and the mechanism
   of seedlessness. Results indicated that both the seedless mutant and its
   wild type were diploid, producing highly similar flowers.
   Radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations significantly reduced pollen
   quantity and viability in the seedless mutant. However, cytological
   observation on pollen mother cells showed that there was no significant
   difference in irregular chromosomal behaviors at each given meiotic
   stage between the mutant and its wild type, indicating that the
   reduction of pollen viability in the seedless mutant might not be caused
   by meiotic disturbances. Also, gamma-radiation-induced chromosomal
   aberrations caused a significantly higher abortion rate (86.21\%) of
   megagametophyte during megasporogenesis and early megagametogenesis,
   resulting in female sterility in the seedless mutant. Intercrossing
   between the seedless mutant and its wild type revealed that pollen
   grains from the mutant efficiently fertilised the wild type, suggesting
   that the mutant is male fertile thereby could be used as male parent in
   further hybridization breeding programs. However, fruits developed from
   the flowers of cross-pollinated with wild-type pollen still produced
   very few seeds, most of which were much smaller in size and contained
   only nucellar embryos inside. Thus, the seedlessness of the mutant was
   caused by strong female sterility. Nucellar embryos could develop
   independently to produce seeds in this cultivar, though with low
   incidence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{Honey bees play a vital role in the pollination of flowers in many
   agricultural systems, while providing honey through well managed
   beekeeping activities. Managed honey bees rely on the provision of
   pollen and nectar for their survival and productivity. Using data from
   field plot inventories in natural mistbelt forests, we (1) assessed the
   diversity and relative importance of honey bee plants, (2) explored the
   temporal availability of honey bee forage (nectar and pollen resources),
   and (3) elucidated how plant diversity (bee plant richness and overall
   plant richness) influenced the amount of forage available (production).
   A forage value index was defined on the basis of species-specific nectar
   and pollen values, and expected flowering period.
   Up to 50\% of the overall woody plant richness were found to be honey
   bee plant species, with varying flowering period. As expected, bee plant
   richness increased with overall plant richness. Interestingly, bee
   plants' flowering period was spread widely over a year, although the
   highest potential of forage supply was observed during the last quarter.
   We also found that only few honey bee plant species contributed 90
   percent of the available forage. Surprisingly, overall plant richness
   did not significantly influence the bee forage value. Rather, bee plant
   species richness showed significant and greater effect. The results of
   this study suggest that mistbelt forests can contribute to increase the
   spatial and temporal availability of diverse floral resources for
   managed honey bees. Conservation efforts must be specifically oriented
   towards honey bee plant species in mistbelt forests to preserve and
   enhance their potential to help maintain honey bee colonies. The
   implications for forest management, beekeeping activities and
   pollination-based agriculture were discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   ashei pollen}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 8}},
Abstract = {{Although considered rare, airborne pollen can be deposited far from its
   place of origin under a confluence of favorable conditions. Temporally
   anomalous records of Cupressacean pollen collected from January air
   samples in London, Ontario, Canada have been cited as a new case of
   long-distance transport. Data on pollination season implicated Juniperus
   ashei (mountain cedar), with populations in central Texas and south
   central Oklahoma, as the nearest source of the Cupressacean pollen in
   the Canadian air samples. This finding is of special significance given
   the allergenicity of mountain cedar pollen. While microscopy is used
   extensively to identify particles in the air spora, pollen from all
   members of the Cupressaceae, including Juniperus, are morphologically
   indistinguishable. Consequently, we implemented a molecular approach to
   characterize Juniperus pollen using PCR in order to test the
   long-distance transport hypothesis. Our PCR results using
   species-specific primers confirmed that the anomalous Cupressacean
   pollen collected in Canada was from J. ashei. Forward trajectory
   analysis from source areas in Texas and the Arbuckle Mountains in
   Oklahoma and backward trajectory analysis from the destination area near
   London, Ontario were completed using models implemented in HYSPLIT4
   (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory). Results from
   these trajectory analyses strongly supported the conclusion that the J.
   ashei pollen detected in Canada had its origins in Texas or Oklahoma.
   The results from the molecular findings are significant as they provide
   a new method to confirm the long-distance transport of pollen that bears
   allergenic importance.}},

Title = {{Most ornamental plants on sale in garden centres are unattractive to
   flower-visiting insects}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{Background. Gardeners and park managers seeking to support biodiversity
   in urban areas often plant ornamentals attractive to flower-visiting
   insects. There is a huge diversity of garden plant varieties, and some
   recommendations are available as to which are attractive to insects.
   However, these are largely not based on rigorous empirical data. An
   important factor in consumer choice is the range of varieties available
   for purchase. In the UK, garden centres are a key link in the supply
   chain between growers and private gardens. This study is the first to
   determine the proportions of flowering ornamentals being sold that are
   attractive to flower-visiting insects.
   Methods. We surveyed six garden centres in Sussex, UK, each over two
   days in 2015, by making 12 counts of insects visiting patches of each
   ornamental plant on display for sale that was in bloom. To provide a
   consistent baseline among different locations, we brought with us and
   surveyed marjoram (Origanum vulgare) plants in pots, which are known to
   be attractive to a wide range of flower-visiting insects. The
   attractiveness of plant varieties to insects was then expressed in two
   ways: the absolute number and relative to that on marjoram (marjoram
   score'), both per unit area of plant cover. In addition, we noted
   whether each variety was recommended as pollinator-friendly either via a
   symbol on the label, or by being included in the Royal Horticultural
   Society's `Perfect for Pollinators' list. Furthermore, we compared the
   attractiveness of plants that are typically grown for more than one year
   versus only one year.
   Results. We surveyed 59-74 plant varieties in bloom across the six
   garden centres. In each garden centre, the distributions of variety
   attractiveness were highly skewed to the right, with most varieties
   being relatively unattractive, and few varieties highly attractive to
   flower-visiting insects. The median attractiveness of varieties with a
   recommendation was 4.2x higher than that of varieties without. But, due
   to the large variation there was a substantial number of both poor
   varieties that had a recommendation and good varieties that did not.
   Median attractiveness of multi-year plants was 1.6x that of singleyear
   plants, with a similar overlap in distributions.
   Discussion. Our study demonstrates the practicality of carrying out
   plant surveys in garden centres. Garden centres display large numbers of
   varieties for sale, most of which are in bloom. Furthermore, data
   gathered in garden centres appear to correlate well with data gathered
   in two previous studies in Sussex for plants established in gardens.
   Although it is unclear whether the varieties being sold in garden
   centres are a fair representation of varieties that are actually grown
   by gardeners, our results suggest that there might be considerable scope
   for making parks and gardens considerably more insect-friendly through
   judicious variety choices.}},

Title = {{Taxonomic and functional trait diversity of wild bees in different urban

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{Urbanization is one of the major anthropogenic processes contributing to
   local habitat loss and extirpation of numerous species, including wild
   bees, the most widespread pollinators. Little is known about the
   mechanisms through which urbanization impacts wild bee communities, or
   the types of urban green spaces that best promote their conservation in
   cities. The main objective of this study was to describe and compare
   wild bee community diversity, structure, and dynamics in two Canadian
   cities, Montreal and Quebec City. A second objective was to compare
   functional trait diversity among three habitat types (cemeteries,
   community gardens and urban parks) within each city. Bees were collected
   using pan traps and netting on the same 46 sites, multiple times, over
   the active season in 2012 and 2013. A total of 32,237 specimens were
   identified, representing 200 species and 6 families, including two new
   continental records, Hylaeus communis Nylander (1852) and Anthidium
   florentinum (Fabricius, 1775). Despite high community evenness, we found
   significant abundance of diverse species, including exotic ones.
   Spatio-temporal analysis showed higher stability in the most urbanized
   city (Montreal) but low nestedness of species assemblages among the
   three urban habitats in both cities. Our study demonstrates that cities
   are home to diverse communities of wild bees, but in turn affect bee
   community structure and dynamics. We also found that community gardens
   harbour high levels of functional trait diversity. Urban agriculture
   therefore contributes substantially to the provision of functionally
   diverse bee communities and possibly to urban pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{The yearlong association of two native honey bee species (Apis dorsata
   and A. florea) with 49 plant species was recorded in a planted forest
   and adjacent agricultural landscape at Multan, Pakistan. The study
   resulted in 588 interactions of A. dorsata with 40 plant species and 454
   interactions of A. florea on 38 plant species. The most visited plants
   species by A. dorsata included Helianthus annuus, Citrus reticulata,
   Trifolium alexandrinum, Moringa oleifera and Calotropis procera, while
   the most visited plant species by A. florea included C. procera,
   Mangifera indica, T. alexandrinum, Coriandrum sativum and H. annuus. The
   peak abundance of bees and floral resources (i.e. number of plant
   species in flowering and abundance of floral units) was recorded during
   early March to late May followed by a gradual decline until December.
   Monthly abundance of both bee species was positively related to the
   floral resources, negatively related to relative humidity while it was
   not significantly related to temperature. The current study may serve as
   a baseline to track the degradation in ecosystem service of cross
   pollination and making new conservation strategies at local scale while
   future research should focus on tempo-spatial variations in foraging
   preferences, floral constancy and effect of foraging competition on crop
   pollination in different ecological regions of Pakistan.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic changes in land use and habitat fragmentation are thought
   to be greater drivers of declines in the abundance and species richness
   of pollinating insects such as bees (Hymenoptera: Apiformes) than
   agricultural intensification and pesticide use. Yet, few studies have
   examined how habitat fragmentation by urbanization affects pollinator
   nesting dynamics. We investigated the nesting dynamics of native
   solitary bee species that inhabit fragments of Sonoran Desert in Tucson,
   AZ. Specifically, we compared floral densities, nest completion, and
   nest attack rates of cavity-nesting bees in large (> 2 ha) and small (<
   0.5 ha) fragments. In small fragments, where resource density was high,
   more nests were occupied and females responded by provisioning offspring
   more quickly than in larger fragments where resource density was low.
   However, nests in small fragments were more likely to be attacked by
   natural enemies than those in large fragments. In this desert system,
   habitat size, the most-often used metric for examination of how
   pollinators respond to habitat fragmentation, affects nesting dynamics
   and demographics through its interactions with nest-site availability,
   abundance of floral resources, and natural enemy attack. As landscape
   fragmentation increases, pollinator conservation should not only
   consider food sources but also nesting requirements and interactions
   with natural enemies.}},

Abstract = {{Ecologically, the interaction between plant and pollinators is mutually
   beneficial for the survival and adaptability. It leads to a higher level
   of fitness of both interacting partners. Birds play significant roles in
   plant reproduction and the fitness of ecosystem in tropical forest. This
   study was carried out with the objective to analyze legitimate floral
   visitors of Bombax ceiba Linn. in tropical forests of Indo-Burma region
   of India in relation to pollen production and mating system. The study
   was performed at two different locations, namely Bethlehem Vengthlang
   (23 degrees 430'N latitude and 92 degrees 430'E longitude) and Tanhril
   (43 degrees 37'N latitudes and 38 degrees 39'E longitudes). Both study
   sites are located 30 km apart from each other. Analysis revealed that
   the pollination in B. ceiba was mostly carried out by the birds, and the
   flowers were visited and foraged by thirteen (13) species of birds
   belonging to five families of the order of Passeriformes. One species of
   squirrel (Funambulus sp.) was also recorded visiting the flowers of B.
   ceiba. Study on mating-system evaluation revealed that the B ceiba is an
   outcrossing tree species, requiring the services of adequate pollinators
   for successful pollination and reproductive fitness. However,
   geitonogamy was partly functional. The index of self-incompatibility
   (ISI) value exposed that the species is mostly self-incompatible. All
   the species of birds were efficient pollinators for B. ceiba in the
   present study sites. The fruit and seed sets following natural
   pollination are fairly high compared with other bird-pollinated species.
   High pollen-production capacities per flower and per tree along with the
   high visitation of bird pollinators would have promoted the maximum
   reproductive success in B. ceiba. This also depicts that the species
   does not have the problem of pollen and resource limitations in
   Indo-Burma region of North-East India. B. ceiba tree is often used in
   urban forestry, and these results can be used for a comparative study of
   natural and human-altered ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) pollinosis is one of seasonal
   allergic rhinitis that mainly occurs in Japan. The pollinosis is caused
   by two main kinds of allergenic proteins called Cry j 1 and Cry j 2
   which exist in Cryptomeria japonica pollen. In our previous study, we
   reported that the size-segregated of airborne fine allergenic Cry j 1
   and morphological change of Cry j 1 due to the contact with rainfall.
   However, the study on airborne allergenic Cry j 2 in different particle
   sizes has not been identified until now. Therefore, the main aim of this
   study is to investigate the size distribution and scattering behavior of
   allergenic Cry j 2. The Cry j 2 particles were collected and determined
   in different particle sizes at the urban sampling points during the most
   severe pollination season of 2012 in Saitama, Japan. After the
   size-segregated Cry j 2 allergenic particles were collected using an
   Andersen high-volume (AHV) atmospheric sample, the airborne Cry j 2
   concentrations were determined with a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
   method. At the same time, the airborne Cryptomeria japonica pollens were
   also counted by the Durham pollen sampler. The higher concentrations of
   the allergenic Cry j 2 were detected even in particle sizes equal to or
   less than 1.1 mu m (PM1.1) than other particle sizes. The airborne
   particles ranges from 0.06 to 11 mu m were also collected by a
   low-pressure impactor (LPI) atmospheric sampler. After that, the
   concentrations of Cry j 2 allergenic particles in fine particle sizes
   were measured by the SPR method either. With the help of this study, we
   have confirmed the existence of fine daughter allergenic particles,
   which clearly differ from the parent pollen grains in size, especially
   after the rainy days. It is possible that the daughter allergenic
   species will be released from the fractions of cell wall and burst
   pollen grains. We concluded that rainwater was one of the important
   factors that affects the release of pollen allergenic proteins of both
   Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 from the parent pollen grains.}},

Abstract = {{Urban landscapes provide habitat for many species, including
   domesticated and feral honey bees, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera:
   Apidae). With recent losses of managed honey bee colonies, there is
   increasing interest in feral honey bee colonies and their potential
   contribution to pollination services in agricultural, natural, and urban
   settings. However, in some regions the feral honey bee population
   consists primarily of Africanized honey bees. Africanized honey bees
   (AHB) are hybrids between European honey bees and the African honey bee,
   Apis mellifera scutellataLepeletier, and have generated economic,
   ecological, and human health concerns because of their aggressive
   behavior. In this study, we used two long-term datasets (7-10years)
   detailing the spatial and temporal distribution of AHB colonies in
   Tucson, AZ, USA, where feral colonies occupy a variety of cavities
   including water meter boxes. A stage-structured matrix model was used to
   elucidate the implications of nest site selection and the effects of
   colony terminations on the structure and dynamics of the AHB population.
   Our results suggest that Tucson's AHB population is driven by a
   relatively small number of source' colonies that escape termination (ca.
   0.165 colonies per km(2) or 125 colonies in total), although immigrating
   swarms and absconding colonies from the surrounding area may have also
   contributed to the stability of the Tucson AHB population. Furthermore,
   the structure of the population has likely been impacted by the number
   and spatial distribution of water meter boxes across the city. The study
   provides an example of how urban wildlife populations are driven by
   interactions among landscape structure, human management, and behavioral
   traits conferred by an invasive genotype.}},

Abstract = {{The usage of inadequately processed industrial waste water (WW) can lead
   to strong soil alkalinity and soil salinization of agricultural fields
   with negative consequences on soil properties and biota. Gypsum as a
   soil amendment to saline-sodic soils is widely used in agricultural
   fields to improve their soil physical, chemical and hence biological
   properties. This study aimed at analysing the effects of intensive WW
   irrigation on the structure and composition of soil-dwelling arthropods
   on spinach fields (Spinacia oleracea L.) in a West African urban
   vegetable production system. We used gypsum as a soil amendment with the
   potential to alleviate soil chemical stress resulting in a potentially
   positive impact on soil arthropods. A total of 32 plots were established
   that showed a gradient in soil pH ranging from slight to strong soil
   alkalinity and that were irrigated with WW (n = 12) or clean water (CW;
   n = 20), including eight plots into which gypsum was incorporated. Our
   study revealed a high tolerance of soil-dwelling arthropods for alkaline
   soils, but spinach fields with increased soil electrical conductivity
   (EC) showed a reduced abundance of Hymenoptera, Diptera and
   Auchenorrhyncha. Arthropod abundance was positively related to a dense
   spinach cover that in turn was not affected by WW irrigation or soil
   properties. Gypsum application reduced soil pH but increased soil EC. WW
   irrigation and related soil pH affected arthropod composition in the
   investigated spinach fields which may lead to negative effects on
   agronomical important arthropod groups such as pollinators and
   predators. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic environmental impacts can disrupt the sensory environment
   of animals and affect important processes from mate choice to predator
   avoidance. Currently, these effects are best understood for auditory and
   chemosensory modalities, and recent reviews highlight their importance
   for conservation. We examined how anthropogenic changes to the visual
   environment (ambient light, transmission, and backgrounds) affect visual
   communication and camouflage and considered the implications of these
   effects for conservation. Human changes to the visual environment can
   increase predation risk by affecting camouflage effectiveness, lead to
   maladaptive patterns of mate choice, and disrupt mutualistic
   interactions between pollinators and plants. Implications for
   conservation are particularly evident for disrupted camouflage due to
   its tight links with survival. The conservation importance of impaired
   visual communication is less documented. The effects of anthropogenic
   changes on visual communication and camouflage may be severe when they
   affect critical processes such as pollination or species recognition.
   However, when impaired mate choice does not lead to hybridization, the
   conservation consequences are less clear. We suggest that the
   demographic effects of human impacts on visual communication and
   camouflage will be particularly strong when human-induced modifications
   to the visual environment are evolutionarily novel (i.e., very different
   from natural variation); affected species and populations have low
   levels of intraspecific (genotypic and phenotypic) variation and
   behavioral, sensory, or physiological plasticity; and the processes
   affected are directly related to survival (camouflage), species
   recognition, or number of offspring produced, rather than offspring
   quality or attractiveness. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic
   effects on the visual environment may be of similar importance relative
   to conservation as anthropogenic effects on other sensory modalities.}},

Abstract = {{A continuous study of atmospheric pollen in Oran Province, northwest
   Algeria, using the Cour method was undertaken between April 2004 and
   April 2006. A pollen-collecting device was placed in the meteorological
   station at Es-Senia airport, near Oran city. It was found that the
   pollen harvest during the first year was 4230 grains, which is
   significantly higher than that in the second year which produced 2258
   grains. These data gave a mean annual index of 3246 pollen grains,
   99.7\% of which were positively identified. Pollen from herbaceous
   plants (69.5\%) proved significantly more abundant than arboreal and
   shrub pollen (27.9 and 2.3\% respectively). The pollen types identified,
   in decreasing order of abundance, were Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae,
   Plantago, Olea, wild Poaceae, Lygeum, Cupressaceae, Urticaceae, Quercus,
   Pinus, total Asteraceae, Eucalyptus, Brassicaceae, Casuarina, Pistacia,
   Arecaceae, Apiaceae, Thymeleaceae and Rumex. The abundance range was
   Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae (41.4\%) to Rumex (0.6\%). The winter
   pollen spectrum largely comprised Arecaceae and Cupressaceae.
   Pollination during spring included most taxa, i.e. total Asteraceae,
   Brassicaceae, Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae, Lygeum, Olea, Pinus,
   Pistacia, Plantago, wild Poaceae, Quercus, Rumex and Urticaceae. During
   the summer Apiaceae and Eucalyptus both pollinated, and Casuarina pollen
   was largely produced in autumn. A significant correspondence between the
   airborne pollen spectrum and the vegetation of the region was
   established.}},

Title = {{Tetraploid citrus progenies arising from FDR and SDR unreduced pollen in
   4x X 2x hybridizations}},
Journal = {{TREE GENETICS \& GENOMES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Polyploid citrus arise by somatic and sexual polyploidization, and both
   have been used in triploid breeding programs. Sexual polyploidization
   ismainly achieved by firstdivision restitution (FDR) or second-division
   restitution (SDR) meiotic restitution mechanisms. In citrus, mostly SDR
   producing 2n ovule has been described. However, we obtained 72
   tetraploid hybrids from 4x X 2x sexual hybridizations using two
   doubled-diploid mandarins as female parents ('Moncada' mandarin and
   `Fina' clementine) and a diploid hybrid tangor as male parent
   (clementine X sweet orange- CSO') suggesting 2n pollen formation. This
   material was used to confirm the existence of 2n pollen in Citrus and to
   analyze its origin. SSR and SNP molecular marker analyses revealed that
   64 out of the 72 recovered tetraploid plants resulted from the
   fertilization of a reduced diploid female gamete by unreduced (diploid)
   pollen from `CSO', whereas eight tetraploid plants arose from
   self-pollination of the tetraploid parent. The maximum-likelihood method
   based on parental heterozygosity restitution (PHR) of centromeric loci
   identified both FDR and SDR as the mechanisms leading to unreduced male
   gamete formation. From the 64 unreduced gametes produced by diploid
   `CSO' tangor, 41 (64.1\%) were originated by FDR, whereas 12 (18.8\%)
   were significant for SDR. Non-conclusive results were obtained for
   11gametes (17.2\%). The pattern of PHR variation of markers located
   along the linkage group 2 confirmed our results at population level. To
   our knowledge, this is the first report of tetraploid citrus progenies
   arising from unreduced pollen and the first description of the
   coexistence of two meiotic restitution mechanisms (SDR and FDR)
   producing unreduced pollen in citrus.}},

Title = {{Landscape dynamics of floral resources affect the supply of a
   biodiversity-dependent cultural ecosystem service}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{415-428}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Cultural ecosystem services, many of which depend on biodiversity, are
   recognized as important but seldom quantified biophysically across
   landscapes. Furthermore, many ecosystem service models are static, and
   the supply of cultural ecosystem services may be misrepresented if
   seasonal shifts in biotic communities are ignored.
   We modeled landscape dynamics of wildflower blooms in a temperate
   montane landscape to determine (1) how floral resources (wildflower
   species richness, abundance, timing, and presence of charismatic
   species) changed over the growing season, (2) how projected wildflower
   viewing hotspots varied over space and time, and (3) how spatial shifts
   in floral resources affected potential public access to wildflower
   viewing.
   Data were collected at 63 sites across a rural-to-urban gradient in the
   Southern Appalachian Mountains (USA). Generalized linear models were
   used to identify factors affecting floral resources at two temporal
   scales. Floral resources were projected across the landscape and
   hotspots of wildflower viewing were quantified using overlay analysis.
   Floral resources were affected by topoedaphic conditions, climate, and
   surrounding building density and changed seasonally. Seasonal models
   revealed locational shifts in ecosystem service hotspots, which changed
   the proportion of hotspots accessible to the public and identified
   wildflower-viewing opportunities unnoticed by static models.
   Relationships between landscape gradients, biodiversity, and ecosystem
   service supply varied seasonally, and our models identified cultural
   ecosystem service hotspots otherwise obscured by simple proxies.
   Landscape models of biodiversity-based cultural ecosystem services
   should include seasonal dynamics of biotic communities to avoid under-
   or over-emphasizing the importance of particular locations in ecosystem
   service assessments.}},

Abstract = {{Research on urban insect pollinators is changing views on the biological
   value and ecological importance of cities. The abundance and diversity
   of native bee species in urban landscapes that are absent in nearby
   rural lands evidence the biological value and ecological importance of
   cities and have implications for biodiversity conservation. Lagging
   behind this revised image of the city are urban conservation programs
   that historically have invested in education and outreach rather than
   programs designed to achieve high-priority species conservation results.
   We synthesized research on urban bee species diversity and abundance to
   determine how urban conservation could be repositioned to better align
   with new views on the ecological importance of urban landscapes. Due to
   insect pollinators' relatively small functional requirementshabitat
   range, life cycle, and nesting behaviorrelative to larger mammals, we
   argue that pollinators put high-priority and high-impact urban
   conservation within reach. In a rapidly urbanizing world, transforming
   how environmental managers view the city can improve citizen engagement
   and contribute to the development of more sustainable urbanization.}},

Abstract = {{Cucumis myriocarpus is an annual cucurbitaceous summer weed infesting
   fallow fields and pastures. Infestation results in reduced moisture
   availability for winter cereal crops as well as reduced crop yields and
   pasture quality. The need to manage this weed is of paramount importance
   given its adverse effects on farming systems, biodiversity and grazing
   livestock and its ranking as the number one weed of importance in
   Australian summer fallows of grain crops. Land management practices,
   including movement of grazing animals and over-stocking, are potentially
   assisting the spread of Cucumis myriocarpus fruits and viable seed. The
   plant is characterized by the presence of small, ellipsoid to spherical
   melon fruits with spiny appendages. Each plant can produce up to 50 or
   more melons per plant, with each fruit containing up to 200 viable
   seeds. Seed is often dormant upon fruit maturity and our results under
   controlled environmental conditions suggest both physiological and
   physical factors influence dormancy. Under field conditions, seedlings
   can form large vines growing upto 3 m in length. Field pollination
   experiments suggest that this melon is mainly self-pollinated by
   insects, including bees, flies and wasps. Cucumis myriocarpus is
   generally managed by the use of various broadleaf phenoxy herbicides and
   systemic post-emergent products. It is found in this study that this
   weed established through multiple flushes of germination, hence multiple
   herbicidal applications coinciding with rainfall events one suggested
   for more efficacious management. However, rotation of infested pastures
   with cereal crops such as canola and wheat also results in improved
   control. Additional studies into the impact of soil with and physical
   properties, disturbance and grazing, are recommended for development of
   more efficacious control measures. This review discusses taxonomy,
   genetic variation, biology and ecology and management of this important
   summer annual weed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Urban ecosystems are relatively recent and heavily human-altered
   terrestrial ecosystems with a surprisingly high diversity of animals,
   plants and other organisms. Urban habitats are also strongly fragmented
   and subject to higher temperatures, providing a compelling model for
   studying adaptation to global change. Crepis sancta (Asteraceae), an
   annual Mediterranean wasteland weed, occupies fragmented urban
   environments as well as certain unfragmented landscapes in southern
   France. We tested for shifts in dispersal, reproductive traits and size
   across a rural-urban gradient to learn whether and how selection may be
   driving changes in life history in urban and fragmented habitats. We
   specifically compared the structure of quantitative genetic variation
   and of neutral markers (microsatellites) between urban and rural and
   between fragmented and unfragmented habitats. We showed that
   fragmentation provides a better descriptor of trait variation than
   urbanization per se for dispersal traits. Fragmentation also affected
   reproductive traits and plant size though one rural population did
   conform to this scheme. Our study shows the role of fragmentation for
   dispersal traits shift in urban environments and a more complex pattern
   for other traits. We discuss the role of pollinator scarcity and an
   inhospitable matrix as drivers of adaptation.

Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{In urban and peri-urban agricultural production systems of Sub-Saharan
   African cities, diverse and functional complex weed communities may help
   to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services and therefore indirectly
   support crop performance. However, effects of agricultural
   intensification and urbanisation on important weed diversity in the West
   African region had received so far little attention, although in Burkina
   Faso and Ghana up to 90 per cent of the population depends on
   agriculture as a main source of income generation. Hence, our research
   focussed on the analysis of changes in weed assemblages' structure and
   function of okra fields that were cultivated under different management
   intensities and were embedded into the rural, peri-urban and urban
   environment of two West African cities: Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) and
   Tamale (Ghana). We found a strong relationship between gender and market
   orientation of okra cultivation. Market orientation of okra farmers was
   also a major driver in shaping weed species assemblages and led to the
   development of a distinct weed assemblage in urban areas that even
   showed higher diversity in weeds' function. Morphological plant traits
   (life form, seed properties) were most affected by agricultural
   practises; distribution pattern of ecological traits (seed dispersal
   mode, pollination vector) seemed to be influenced additionally by
   environmental characteristics with less entomophilous but more
   ornithochorous weed species on okra fields within urban areas. Our
   results revealed that the management of okra was highly variable and
   that this variation was influenced by fariners' socioeconomic background
   leading to changes in soil properties. These in turn may alter the
   functional diversity of beneficial weed communities beyond changes in
   species richness by potentially harming the provisioning of ecosystem
   services such as pest control and pollination. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Changing odour landscapes: the effect of anthropogenic volatile
   pollutants on plant-pollinator olfactory communication}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{56-64}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Olfactory signals, often in synergy with visual signals, mediate the
   interactions between plants and animals. However, urbanization and
   agricultural practices are both sources of volatile organic compounds
   (VOCs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that have the potential to
   interfere with plant-animal communication and to disrupt mutualistic
   interactions. In this review, we explore how anthropogenic airborne
   pollutants may disrupt chemical information transfer between flowering
   plants and flower visitors.
   2. The emission of anthropogenic volatile pollutants (AVPs) including
   VOCs and formation of ROS, for example from traffic or industries, and
   non-natural biogenic VOCs, for example from introduced crops, may have a
   number of effects: (i) changes in plant signalling as a consequence of
   plants experiencing physiological stress; (ii) chemical interference
   (chemical degradation/transformation of infochemicals); (iii) increased
   levels of background noise impeding signal detection; and (iv) changes
   in pollinator signal perception and behaviour. All of the above in turn
   could have consequences for the biological fitness of plants and animals
   that rely on olfactory information as pivotal functional signals.
   3. The study of anthropogenic airborne pollutants and their effects on
   plant signalling is just emerging and the impacts of this aspect of
   anthropogenic emissions are barely understood. Volatiles emitted from
   anthropogenically changed landscapes could, however, have far-reaching
   consequences for ecosystem functioning in adjacent natural zones,
   particularly in fragmented landscapes. In response to the wide gap in
   our knowledge on the mechanisms that govern interference of
   anthropogenic VOCs with olfactory information, future research
   directions are proposed with the aim to inspire research to help
   elucidate the risks of anthropogenic VOCs for plant-pollinator
   communities and improve risk assessment strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Human activities are threatening biodiversity at an unprecedented scale
   and pace, thus potentially affecting also the provision of critical
   ecosystem services, including insect pollination. Insect pollinators
   play an essential functional role in terrestrial ecosystems, supporting
   ecological stability and food security worldwide. Therefore, assessing
   impact on pollinators is fundamental in any effort aiming at enhancing
   the environmental sustainability of human production and consumption,
   especially in the agri-food supply chains. Different drivers are leading
   to pollinator populations' declines. Improving a supply-chain oriented
   assessment of the occurrence of pressure and impacts on pollinators is
   needed. However, current methodologies assessing impact along supply
   chains, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), miss to assess impact on
   pollinators. In fact, none of the existing life cycle impact assessment
   (LCIA) models effectively accounts for pollinators. Some LCIA models
   have mentioned pollination, but none has presented key drivers of impact
   and a proposal for integrating pollinators as target group for
   biodiversity protection within an LCIA framework. In order to devise a
   pathway towards the inclusion of impacts on pollinators in LCIA, we
   conducted a literature review of environmental and anthropogenic
   pressures acting on insect pollinators, potentially threatening
   pollination services. Based on the evidence in literature, we identified
   and described eight potential impact drivers, primarily deriving from
   industrial development and intensive agricultural practice: 1)
   intensified land use as a result of uncontrolled expansion of urban
   areas and modern agricultural practices; 2) use of pesticides; 3)
   presence of invasive alien plants; 4) competition with invasive alien
   pollinator species; 5) global and local climate change; 6) spread of
   pests and pathogens; 7) electro-magnetic pollution and 8) genetically
   modified crops. To account for these drivers in LCIA, there are specific
   modeling needs. Hence, the current study provides recommendation on how
   future research should be oriented to improve the current models and how
   novel indicators should be developed in order to cover the existing
   conceptual and methodological gaps. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Background and aims - Sempervivum funckii var. aqualiense, considered
   the only endemic vascular plant taxon of Belgium still existing in the
   wild, is threatened by urban development. There is a need for proposing
   appropriate in situ or ex situ conservation strategies through a precise
   evaluation of population demographic and genetic characteristics.
   Methods - We investigated demographic dynamics for six years (rosette
   density, floral production, reproductive success, seed germination and
   seedling recruitment), pollination (visiting insects and potential
   pollinators) and genetic diversity using IS SR markers of the unique
   population of S. funckii var. aqualiense.
   Key results - Visiting insects and potential pollinators, especially
   common and generalist pollen foraging bees, are abundant in the
   population of S. funckii var. aqualiense and the plant seems highly
   attractive. Pollination limitation does not represent a conservation
   issue. Despite a good floral production in most years (250-1,558
   flowering ramets, comprising 4-36 flowers), viable seed production and
   germination represent very rare events (0.05\% viable seeds and 1
   seedling) because of meiosis abnormalities related to the hybrid origin
   of the taxon. Recruitment by clonal propagation (vegetative rosettes)
   has been detected. Genetic diversity is very low (H = 0.0148), and may
   have originated from somatic mutations, related to extensive vegetative
   propagation, but is also compatible with relictual segregating sexual
   reproduction.
   Conclusions - The most cost-effective method for establishing new
   populations is the transplantation of rosettes. Given the low viable
   seed production, creating an ex situ seed bank requires collecting seeds
   for many nonconsecutive years. Conserving the rare genotypes can be done
   by preserving seeds and as many rosettes as possible. The preservation
   of the only existing population in its entirety appears to be the best
   option for long-term sustainable conservation of S. funckii var.

Abstract = {{From the beginning of the 21st century, following major European and
   global initiatives such as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005)
   {[}1, 2] and The Economics of Ecosystem and Biodiversity {[}3], the idea
   that Ecosystem services could be used as a decision support tool, it
   gained considerable importance in several fields: from economy to public
   policy, from territorial planning to environmental assessment. This
   research is part of the methodological framework of an important
   strategic reference: the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, and
   international research project which rank the ecosystem services to
   identify the state of the latter, accessing the consequences of
   ecosystem changes on human well- being. According to the MA {[}1], they
   are grouped into four categories: supplying services (food and fiber
   production, water production, biological and cosmetics production etc.),
   regulation services (maintenance of the air quality, climate regulation,
   flood regulation, erosion or drought, pollination, water purification,
   etc.), cultural services (cultural diversity, recreational or spiritual
   services, aesthetic values, ecotourism etc.), and support services
   (carbon sequestration, soil formation, etc.). This classification in the
   most widespread and used in ecosystem studies because is easy to
   understand its logic and it can define fixed categories. Starting from
   this classification, the work done contributes to build interpretative
   models for the evaluation of a relevant part of the fourth class of
   ecosystem services: the territorial tourism attractiveness.}},

Title = {{The role of fruit bats in plant community changes in an urban forest in
   Indonesia}},
Journal = {{RAFFLES BULLETIN OF ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{497-505}},
Abstract = {{Urban forests are important for alleviating the impact of environmental
   stress in intensely developed cities and play a role in maintaining
   natural interactions in urban ecosystems. Two of the most densely
   populated cities in Southeast Asia: Jakarta and Depok, Indonesia, have
   seen a dramatic decrease in green spaces, despite the importance of such
   spaces in making these cities more liveable and sustainable. One of the
   few remaining green spaces in the greater Jakarta area is the urban
   forest at Universitas Indonesia, yet little is known about its native
   biota, especially its bats. A host plant association study was conducted
   to determine the role of fruit bats in the urban forest ecosystem, which
   are suspected to be seed dispersers and pollinators. Eight fruit bat
   species (Cynopterus brachyotis, C. horsfieldii, C. minutus, C. sphinx,
   C. titthaecheilus, Macroglossus minimus,M. sobrinus, and Rousettus
   amplexicaudatus) consumed plant products from 26 plant species.
   Bat-plant species pairs were significantly associated (Cramer's V =
   0.51, p < 0.05). Ficus species comprised the highest percentage of
   plants consumed (25\%), yet they were never deliberately planted,
   suggesting that fruit bats introduced them from other areas.
   Additionally, introduced plants were found outside the introduction
   area. By acting as seed dispersers and pollinators, fruit bats
   potentially contribute to the current plant diversity in the urban
   forest and connect distant plant populations. Fruit bats facilitated
   seed dispersal of species important to forest regeneration, an important
   insight for future plans to increase green spaces to mitigate the
   negative effects of anthropogenic change in urban environments.}},

Abstract = {{Fragaria moschata also known as musk strawberry is one of the four
   indigenous species of Fragaria in Europe. These wild species harbour
   interesting characteristics and are therefore a valuable source for
   breeding in general. To evaluate the potential of wild populations of
   musk strawberries we have collected 110 strawberry plants at a natural
   site in Saxony, Germany, characterized by woodland, semi-dry grassland
   and meadow orchards. Flow cytometry and genotyping by microsatellite
   markers were used to identify the species background of each plant,
   thereby plants of other species (F. vesca and F. viridis) and some
   interspecific hybrids were detected. Plant characteristics were scored
   for each individual (leaf and flower morphology, stolon type, and
   trichome formation). Since F. moschata is a dioecious species the sex of
   individual plants was determined morphologically. Flowering female and
   hermaphroditic plants were pollinated by hand on a daily basis to ensure
   good fruit set. Fruits were harvested, weighted, photographed, and
   morphologic characteristics were classified in dependence of the UPOV
   criteria. Additionally, the soluble solid content (in degrees Brix) and
   the citric acid equivalent were determined. Our data revealed a
   remarkable high diversity in fruit morphology referring to size, colour,
   shape and a high variation of the sugar/acid-ratio between individual
   accessions.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of fashion involves changes and the rise and fall of popular
   trends over time. Gardens and landscapes are not immune to such swings
   of fashion, but because implementing changes takes longer with
   long-lived plants, the differences come about gradually. The use of
   exotic plants in landscapes and gardens became a fashion because wealthy
   members of society wanted and could afford something different to
   distinguish their landscapes from others; ostentation and one-upmanship
   were achieved with plants from faraway places. The use of local species
   was not a window on the world, and the romance of the plant collector
   sending back exotic species contributed to their desirability. The
   recent issue of the convention on biodiversity has set some limits on
   the commercialization of natural resources outside their homelands.
   Additionally, the awareness of contributions of native plants to the
   whole ecology, even in an urban setting, has prompted research on their
   relations with insects and other organisms. Whether it be pollinator or
   migrating butterfly survival, drought stresses or a perceived reduction
   in maintenance, native plants have seen a resurgence in North American
   landscapes as counters to loss of biodiversity and coping with
   environmental stresses. Tropical and subtropical ornamental plants will
   eventually find their places in similar scenarios. Being natives,
   however, does not free them from problems inflicted by invasive species.
   The use of native plants is also finding a blend with organic and
   ecological landscape management programs.}},

Journal = {{ARTIBUS ET HISTORIAE}},
Year = {{2017}},

Pages = {{129+}},
Abstract = {{The development of the monumental marble tomb in fifteenth-century Italy
   reveals extraordinary cross-pollination between cities, artists and
   patrons. By considering the movement of Florentine sculptors, their
   works and their designs, this paper isolates some key moments in the
   exchange. Ideas first articulated in Florence migrated to Venice and
   Naples and Rome. The desire for Florentine-style tombs in each of these
   cities suggests an aesthetic choice. Florentine tombs, like other
   sculptures identified as Florentine in origin, became increasingly
   popular over the course of the fifteenth century. The practicalities
   associated with erecting a Florentine-style tomb led to three different
   means of transfer: artists traveled to and from Florence, carrying
   knowledge of tombs they saw in that city to other places; the tombs were
   carved in Florence and then shipped from there to cities across Italy
   and, finally, artists provided drawings that were employed by local
   sculptors in the creation of tombs that deliberately evoked Florentine
   types. This process was replaced, at the end of the Quattrocento, with a
   new and equally fervent desire for Roman-style tombs.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the contribution of leaves on the secondary-lateral
   branches to sucrose concentration in the fruit of watermelon (Citrullus
   lanatus) `Sambok-kkul'. Plants were trained to two primary-lateral
   branches after topping the main stem, and treated with either removal of
   the entire secondary-lateral branch (treatment 2C), or removal of the
   secondary-lateral branch below the fruit set node (treatment 2C-1). On
   average, 2C-1 plants had 30\% smaller leaves at the 5th node above fruit
   set on the primary-lateral branches (EL) at 3 weeks after pollination
   compared to the 2C plants. Total leaf area of 2C-1 plants was 26\%
   higher, on average, however, due to the leaves on the remaining portion
   of the secondary-lateral branch. At 2 weeks after pollination, both the
   leaves on the primary-lateral branches of the EL of the 2C treatment
   plants and leaves on the secondary lateral branches (SL) of the 2C-1
   treatment showed significantly higher photosynthetic activity than other
   leaves. However, at 4 weeks after pollination, the highest
   photosynthesis activity and lowest water potential were observed in the
   leaves on the secondary lateral branch SL of the 2C-1 treatment plants.
   The leaf sucrose content of the 2C-1 treatment plants started increasing
   much more steeply from 4 weeks after pollination, while there was no
   significant increase in the sucrose content under the 2C treatment at
   the same period. In particular, the sucrose content in the SL of the
   2C-1 leaves became greater than that of the EL of the 2C leaves starting
   3 weeks after pollination. There was a 3.9-fold increase in sucrose
   content of the 2C-1 fruit for 4 to 5 weeks after pollination, while
   there was only a 1.4-fold increase in the 2C fruit. Micrographs of
   harvested fruit flesh showed higher cellulose in the 2C fruit flesh than
   in 2C-1. These results suggest that a transition from sink to source of
   carbon in younger and older leaves may influence the availability of
   carbohydrates for fruit development and quality.}},
